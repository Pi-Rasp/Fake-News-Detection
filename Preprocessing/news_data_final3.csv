abhinandan sekhri to be canonised by vatican,post his confirmation that jesus christ and prophet muhammad were indeed historical figures vatican released a press statement acknowledging abhinandan sekhri s contribution to further the evangelical mission it is already in the public domain that abhinandan had doubted krishna s existence but acknowledged both christ and muhammad were historical figures the office of pope is even considering to canonise abhinandan sekhri if and when it happens sekhri would become the first saint to be declared so while living on earth the saint of india one official who was very very close to the pope but preferred to be anonymous said this decision was a conscious one subject to one condition though the informer refused to spell out the exact condition for sekhri to become a living saint he referred to the issue of christ s birth and death apparently vatican considers sekhri as the reincarnation of one of the three wise men who travelled to jerusalem to greet the infant christ when asked what is new in sekhri s statement that christ was a historical figure the pontiff laughed it is true that christ was a historical figure however there always was a certain myth around his birth and death we hope abhinandan sekhri to use his good analytical skills and remove this myth however the former vatican man who wanted pope to resign from his post sent a mail to us saying that this decision is only to divert attention of the world media from the continuously popping up of various sex scandals involving many bishops and all kinds of human beings from kids to old men and women apart from the diversion canonising someone from india or china would also help the church in its evangelical mission of harvesting souls after goa inquisition the conversion rate of indians has fallen to a very slow rate despite lures ranging from rice bags to study sponsorship in the western countries the rate of conversion remained low not even canonising teresa could accelerate the growth rate of conversion so the church is toying with the idea of having a living saint efforts to reach sekhri for his response have failed newslaundry office however has replied that sekhri is on a very important tsk of converting mythology into history and can not be disturbed,Fake
aap evolves caste politics,like the congress party and the bjp the new political party aap has also not been wholly detached from advancing the caste factor in the electoral politics it can not be told that the aap is under stress because it keeps touching the traditional caste factor in its party politics former aap leader ashutosh has accused the party of having tried to invoke caste sentiments by using his surname during the 2014 elections afterwards another prominent leader atishi marlena has dropped her exceptional surname because it sounded more like a christian name marlena is the last name of atishi which is said to be a title mingling marx and lenin it has been emphasised that she has dropped her given name for some kind of the higher objective coming of a punjabi rajput family she became the party s first candidate for the 2019 parliamentary polls although her actual surname ends with singh yet she refrains using the last name simply to put a damper on the caste based politics was her christian sounding surname marlena averse to the caste based political setting she has made it clear that it was not been initiated under the party s pressure it was her own decision as she wanted to show her caste free face denying the influence of caste angle on his party the aap general secretary akshay marathe stated that our discourse was around healthcare and education not on identities of caste and religion taking the point even the aimim chief assad ud din owaisi said this was the reality of indian politics one could not have a muslim or christian sounding name to get elected naturally he took the time to study the caste factor in the politics and its effects over the clever political designs his mind definitely hangs around the politics which is fixed firmly on the caste connection,Fake

trying to snake charm buffalo,bhains ke aage been bajana proved correct in dewas when the domestic animal turned violent perhaps this biblical phrase was a kind of instruction to the people by jesus christ its meaning was usually taken as a useless effort or negligence that was what the congress party functionaries along with the anguished commuters wanted to portray at their protest site but their discomfiture in not knowing how to properly deal with a buffalo has come as a very poignant scene before them as they could not realise of the animal s aggressive behaviour all of a sudden were they so naive in playing the flute facing the animal with complete concentration when the congress functionaries started trying to snake charm a buffalo enraged buffalo hit them hard amid the cacophony the protestors ran helter skelter as the buffalo s fury was similar to spanish bull in the race their planning was just spoiled by the brutal behaviour of the buffalo they failed to read exactly what the cattle had in its huge mind the agitators started running for a safe shelter some might think in their precocious mind that the buffalo was a staunch follower of the bjp because of its excessive concern about its peer cow the congressmen thought their action was for drawing madhya pradesh government s attention towards delay in early approval of an inter city bus service between indore and dewas in mp however their garlanding and playing the flute did not secure ample approval by the particular cattle the moment it knocked down the politicians by its pointed horns there was utter chaos and commotion at the protest site the injuries were treated with the first aid facility immediately they soulfully thanked the almighty that none among them was seriously hurt what began with a political motive ended in a very sad note,Fake

didi s confusion between bisibela bath and blood bath,setting after working hard on pouring down various colours on her old white saree didi stood quiet and looked at the violent mix of all ghastly colours the white piece of cloth looked as if was used to clean a butcher s shop after used to clean tables in a mishti house how peaceful she wondered and congratulated herself for painting such a thing that was beyond imagination for any other ordinary mortal she walked to the cot that was made of bamboos and jute to match her simple lifestyle and rested she switched on the old onida black white television and panasonic vcr to watch her favourite recording a group of her followers clad in simple dhotis were counting the cash that was looted from the sadhana scam a blissful smile crossed her lips the video was a stress buster for her within minutes of watching she relaxes and sleeps sound twist after three minutes however the video got blurred and the b w tv screen was full of colours didi thought there was something wrong with the tv and wanted to tap it on the top so it can become normal don t get up the voice from the tv sprang as the vertical bars of colours transformed into colourful concentric circles zooming in and out simultaneously this is even freshening she said to herself and she remembered nothing the interview seeing her immobile condition byomkesh bakshi pulled the curtains and revealed himself he came straight to her and dangled a gold locket tied to a silver thread in front of her at the centre of the bangle are two emeralds shaped in the form of leaves fixed over a crescent didi was in a trance but liked it more and decided in her subconscious to make it tmc symbol her eyes were rolling along with the locket that was swinging like a pendulum byomkesh suddenly remembered the minny mouse that swung eyes like that at micky so didi liked the design of locket he decided to leave the locket for her after his mission in the voice of amrish puri when he was in romantic mood byomkesh asked didi do you want this locket didi yes bb what you will do with it didi i will make this tmc symbol bb this can be yours if you clarify few doubts didi ask

an old lady came with a tray and set up supper for didi seeing the food in front of her there was a sparkle in the eyes of didi yyaah blood bath she cried loudly and put the locket aside and started eating the old lady looked at didi with pity and left byomkesh slowly left the room and followed the old lady she heard his footsteps and turned to face him he introduced himself as a secret doctor and asked her what she had given to didi to eat she gave him a weird look and said it was bisibela bath part of kannada cuisine he blurted but she was calling it blood bath why the old lady heaved a sigh and said this was happening ever since she returned from bengaluru after attending swearing ceremony of kumaraswamy during the dinner bisibela bath was served and didi liked it very much before she wanted to ask its name pappu asked kumaraswamy what that item was already angry with the way he was forced to drink poison kumaraswamy said blood bath a speciality of karnataka and didi took it seriously she liked the taste of bisibela bath so much she was eating it for breakfast lunch and supper ever since she had not even touched fish for the last two or three months she became pure vegetarian and i too am now forced to eat bisibela bath thrice a day she looked sad so you mean didi referred to bisibela bath when she threatened central government about blood bath he probed further the point is her english is a bit poor the old lady continued in fact she was supporting nrc all she meant was once uncivilised people fighting on the streets would go away the fights on the streets would be between only civilised ones meaning only debates and arguments and no physical fights and everyone would eat the vegetarian bisibela bath and live happily forever a sarcastic smile passed over the lips of the old lady coupled with her poor english were her ferocious facial expressions and she communicated something that is entirely opposite of what she wanted to say omg byomkesh stunned at the explanation omg omg he repeated further the old lady slapped him as if to pull him out of shock there is nothing to do with god one should have control over language and body language as well byomkesh nodded in agreement would you like to have some bisibela bath she invited him to have supper with her yes mam sure i would like to taste the item that transformed didi the interviewer

can common game rooms for children in uttarakhand villages help reduce caste tensions,any mention of the hill state of uttarakhand brings to mind scenes of misty mountains clouds and to some even the earthy smell of marijuana but to those living in the rural interiors of the state the mountains are not a scenic escape but an insurmountable nemesis that often keep them from availing basic amenities that city dwellers so easily take for granted take for example the easy availability for children to play games in their neighbourhoods growing up in cities with easy access to safe and premeditated spaces for studying and playing one can often forget that these simple amenities may in fact be a luxury in remote areas noting the difficulty three student researchers have decided to bring about a change by creating games rooms for children in remote villages in uttarakhand former jadavpur university students payal sarkar and souradeep chakraborty from kolkata along with ankaj kumar from ranchi university were working on their fellowship the two year programme required them to facilitate teachers and children of primary schools for better development of a childs growth and to create public system projects and they have been working in uttarakhands bagheshwar district for almost two years now for the same it was while working in the secluded pindar valley when they noticed the lack of wholesome educational and recreation avenues for children in the villages of the valley while villages and communities did have schools these were often in dilapidated conditions with limited resources and teaching staff and were focused entirely on stoic teaching of theory if so children need more than just book learning to truly develop their personalities we wanted to introduce recreation as a form of personality development where children can enjoy a more holistic approach to learning said payal sarkar a former student of international relations she added that allowing children safe spaces for positive exploration of creative interests was important to their mental growth some of the villages that they have been working in have no motorable roads and can only be accessed on foot making resources very scarce darkness descends quicker on mountains and electricity is scarce leaving children with almost no options for recreation and relaxation at first the trio intended the games rooms to be built inside the schools already present in the villages but the idea was called off and the trio decided to make the games rooms in areas that are openly accessible to the entire community only a certain number of children go to school we wanted to build the games rooms outside of schools so that all children can access it equally even if they dont go to school payal said not all play providing a common space for children to gather and play discuss and participate in activities together is not just aimed at holistic personality development according to the young researchers rural uttarakhand continues to be bound by a stringent caste system that often exhibits itself in the form of social discrimination and boycott the problem is so pervasive that it seeps through even to the children for example souradeep chakraborty told news18 that in some villages upper caste children refer to those from lower castes as bimar sick many people do not allow members of lower castes to eat at their place even at a wedding lower caste guests are provided with rations and are expected to cook their own meal the problem of caste is deeply rooted and to weed it out one has to attack the very foundation sensitizing future generations is one of the basic steps toward ensuring that such injustices do not continue said souradeep he added that the community games rooms would act as a place for children of all castes and classes to play and enjoy together the trio also hopes that by bringing children together the common recreation centres would also promote healthy interaction between boys and girls many girls especially in rural areas continue to get married off as minors and often not allowed to mix freely in society after puberty or even continue their education young girls suffer various taboos including ones against menstruation payal has been trying to get the schools in the villages they have been working in to adopt a sanitary napkin vending corner for girl students and has also held sessions with children and parents regarding womens menstrual and sexual health ankaj kumar who has a bba degree and hails from bihar has taken career counselling sessions in order to tell both men and women the professional options available to them and guide them into making more beneficial decisions in future most children here grow up to join the army its the dominant profession here and women are married off early so they usually dont work ankaj said the career counselling is important both from a gender and caste perspective as both engender professional side effects according to the researchers most members of the scheduled caste were engaged in daily wage work and did not have steady jobs most of them worked as has and musk farmers with the community games rooms the researchers hope to at least generate a conversation and questions about oppression and discrimination among the youth instead of normalising it a hard task the trio has chosen three villages uniya sorag and khati all part of the wacham cluster in pindar valley to begin their first trial these villages have near zero cellular network and were largely cut off from the modern world at first the trio decided to first become part of the communities and understand their problems each adopted a village and underwent an immersion process in which they started living with people from the respective villages even working there they noted the schools in each of the village and started speaking to the village elders and teachers regarding the state of junior elementary and higher education in pindar valley after living over one and a half years of living in the district and closely observing the cultural and socio economic fabric of the area the trio decided to launch the campaign to improve the lives of children in secluded areas to start a conversation about creating recreational spaces for children was at first hard since most of the people were struggling to manage their incomes and other hardships that come with living deep in the mountains the three students first approached parents and children individually and slowly involved members of local bodies and stakeholders to get the work started in august gram sabhas were held by the three in all three villages which were attended by villagers as well as members of the gram panchayat following which they procured permission for the project the villagers have allowed the trio to use certain existing building to set up the game rooms however the three are still short on funding they have managed to raise about rs 25 000 souradeep said but they still need about rs 75 000 to successfully build three games rooms and are still running an online fundraising campaign for the same deciding content for the games was also challenging as it involved coming up with ideas involving everyday things that would easily be available on the secluded mountains we designed the games in such a way that anyone could play them anywhere they dont require any boards or dices payal said one such game is a local adaptation of chinese whispers another involves sketching souradeep also has plans to create a book of illustrations that would contain stories told to him by villagers he wants to print the book in several languages including in the local tongue danpuriya he has been collecting stories for months now and felt that the book would help bring out the personal lives and hardships that these remote populations suffer if the first trial is successful the trio plan to take the project forth at a state level and expand to creating library corners and other creative spaces for the young in remote areas,Real

opinion bad news for dmk too as aiadmk abandons anna for amma,a defining trait of dravidian politics is the quest to wrest the legacy of a departed leader it s not just a symbolic emotional quest but one that defines the very existence of a political party like the all india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam aiadmk since its inception the aiadmk never created the post of president in the party and the highest post within is that of the general secretary this was because the late mg ramachandran who broke away from the dravida munnetra kazhagam dmk and founded the aiadmk in 1972 asserted that his eternal leader was dmk founder cn annadurai and hence the highest post in the party was symbolically eternally left for anna mgr left the dmk following differences with m karunanidhi who took over as president of the party and chief minister after anna passed away in 1969 and had to reassert that he and his party represented the true principles of the dravidian movement as claimants to the anna legacy in effect both karunanidhi and mgr represented the same political ideology of their mentor before the electorate it was only a bitter personal rivalry that was a defining difference this and not just the influence of cinema is the genesis of the personality oriented politics in the state cinema did fuel the rivalry and help build the personalities but the reason the rivalry and personalities are so fiercely projected in the state is because without the personality rivalries the aiadmk versus dmk battle has no foundation in other words there is no scope for an ideological difference or debate as both would be on the same side the rivalry had to be intense to fuel political differentiation and it manifested itself through the twists and turns over the last five decades most recently it was this battle for anna s legacy that led to the dispute over granting a final resting place for m karunanidhi next to cn annadurai s memorial at the marina beach since mgr was buried on one side of the anna memorial it was imperative for the dmk to ensure that karunanidhi was buried on the other side to symbolically assert their departed leader as the political heir to anna the aiadmk dispensation tried to deny that space but lost the battle in the madras high court now a renewed dmk under mk stalin s leadership is reasserting itself as the only custodian of dravidian political principles of annadurai and there seems to be no powerful counter to that claim from the aiadmk the ruling aiadmk faction in the state is fighting its battle within the party for the amma legacy it is desperate to establish itself as the true custodian of jayalalithaa s legacy and that claim is being challenged by rebel leader ttv dinakaran who split from the aiadmk to launch his own party the core of the power struggle between the two sections is to wrest the amma legacy and establish themselves as custodians of it the winner in this battle in an election would claim to be the heir to the late jayalalithaa while their objective is to capture power in the state like in the past in the eyes of the electorate they have no other explanation or narrative for political existence but this battle is within the aiadmk as a party and not with a political opponent outside of it the factions are similar in character and represent the exact same political thought feeding on the battle for legacy as a narrative for political existence the problem is that the aiadmk in search of an amma legacy does not have a leader of stature to challenge the dmk s claim to represent the anna legacy though jayalalithaa was not from the same vintage as mgr or karunanidhi she had the stature to reiterate the aiadmk s position as a challenger to the dmk but after her demise there is no other leader to carry forward that challenge arguably the reason the aiadmk has survived is because jayalalithaa was in power when she passed away and the party is surviving on the remnants of that victory in fact no other political party in the state barring mdmk leader vaiko has the stature to challenge the dmk as the most powerful custodians of the anna legacy this is dangerous not just for the aiadmk but for the future of dravidian political ideology itself as it is the quest for the anna legacy that is the bedrock of the political narrative which remained between the two dravidian parties in tamil nadu and it is because of the dominance of the aiadmk versus dmk personality battle that there was no space for any other political ideology to evolve in the state in this backdrop when there is no challenge to the dmk narrative as the custodian of core dravidian principles the field is thrown open for a counter ideological force this is what the next election in tamil nadu will test and decide the smaller question would be which of the aiadmk factions will wrest the amma legacy but the more significant question would be whether the battle would continue to be fought among those who claim to be custodians of an anna legacy or will it eventually turn into one between an anna legacy and an opposing political force that has nothing to do with that legacy or even opposes it on an ideological level the answer to that question would lie in how the aiadmk recovers and if it does not which political force will occupy the space of opposition to the dmk in fact this would be important even for the dmk from a long term perspective having an ideological opponent in the electoral fray is something the party has not experienced in the last four decades and hence it may have to see the collapse of an aiadmk with worry instead of jubilation,Real

was ready some would call this arrogance others diffidence in either case it didn t make the leadership manual in the present context rahul is said to be working on a two fold strategy to take on the bjp the short term plan for 2019 is designed with the sole purpose of checkmating prime minister narendra modi at any cost in other words in rahul s scheme of things it means being the smaller partner in some states during the coming round of general elections rahul s sense is that non nda opposition parties are rather unanimous in not projecting any leader against modi for they realise that to do so would be to fall into the bjp s trap the non nda opposition leaders feel that despite all their potential and promise no young or seasoned leader from the opposition is in a position to match modi it s better to fight him on issues priya quotes tejashwi yadav and jayant choudhury as saying this is how we will cut them nda down to size we will not talk about personalities it s not one personality taking them on in up you have me akhilesh and mayawati if all of us come together and say the same thing then it s a strategy of encirclement rahul s long term goal for 2024 is different the congress president hopes to establish himself as a credible prime ministerial face by then priya thinks rahul will gain from 12 states including rajasthan madhya pradesh haryana maharashtra and gujarat which will help the congress improve its tally in 2019 if the congress crosses the hundred mark she argues rahul s short term plan will be in practice giving the congress a relevant role in any anti bjp coalition or as a more sure footed leader of the opposition in parliament the contenders offers interesting debate around youth in indian politics vir sanghvi in his usual candid style points out how most young politicians in india are actually older than david cameron who was 47 when he stepped down as prime minister of uk put bluntly india is a country of the young ruled by the old and the very old something like 50 per cent of india s population is in its twenties and 65 per cent of the population is under 35 yet you will search in vain for a single minister who is under 35 in most indian cabinets sanghvi says while giving a rationale that it has something to do with the circumstances that prevailed when india won independence in 1947 the leaders of the newly free nation were people who had led the struggle for liberation from the british because it had been a long hard battle they were already quite old or at the very least middle aged by the time they took office in the first government of free india rahul s long term goal for 2024 is different the congress president hopes to establish himself as a credible prime ministerial face by then,Real
trs facing the heat on campaign trail but brand kcr might come to the rescue,last week a former trs minister in telangana who was campaigning ahead of the assembly elections in the state was gheraoed by a mob of farmers the angry crowd stopped his car and refused to listen to him what followed next was a halt in the campaign due to the chaos the incident happened in wanaparthy district in telangana the farmers wanted an assurance from the minister that adequate water would be provided for irrigation this is not the first time jupally krishna rao minister for rural development was mobbed by people previously he had to get on top of his car to pacify the angry crowd in the last one month there have been at least seven such incidents where telangana rashtra samithi trs leaders have faced backlash while on campaign trail with villages taking oath to boycott elections and asking leaders to sign a bond saying that the promises would be fulfilled the ruling party leaders are facing the heat earlier this month a farmer from narnoor mandal in adilabad district committed suicide due to crop failure her husband had to carry her on his shoulders to cross a stream to reach the hospital sadly the woman died a week later residents of the mandal protested with banners saying no roads no bridges then why vote do not come to our village asking for votes in another incident people from wardhanapet in warangal protested against the local trs candidate aroori ramesh for lack of development slogans were raised saying you have no right to ask for our vote these incidents are definitely a setback to the party ahead of the elections in december with the anti incumbency factor gaining momentum it is not going to be an easy ride this time say analysts but will caretaker chief minister k chandrashekar rao s image come to the rescue probably yes say political analysts in the state at the grassroots the local leaders performance might not be satisfying but trs will have an edge due to kcr and his brand name prof nageshwar rao a political analyst told news18 the chief minister time and again has expressed confidence that the party would easily win at least 100 of the 119 seats he had also said last month that the trs had fulfilled all the promises made in the previous manifesto what came as a relief and a boost to the trs candidates is the partial manifesto released last week the manifesto this time includes allowance for unemployed youth a higher pension pay apart from the loan waiver analysts believe that the latest promises will give the campaign a boost and help the candidates in fielding questions on the ground also the opposition has not been able to galvanise the discontent into an anti kcr narrative which is another advantage of the trs apart from the chief minister s flamboyant image adds nageshwar rao what worked well for kcr in 2014 was the separate telangana agitation the fight for a separate state in which he was at the forefront helped him gain support from masses but now the situation is different the focus is on the promises made and how much of it has been a reality the questions is are people of the state ready to give kcr another chance most likely yes say analysts the anti kcr narrative is building but i don t think that is the situation as of now added nageshwar rao telangana will go for polls on december 7 and the counting will follow on the 11th of the same month,Real

bjp is now using goddess durga against me says kanhaiya kumar,patna former jawaharlal nehru university students union president kanhaiya kumar has shifted focus from delhi to bihar after the communist party of india cpi informally announced to field him from the begusarai lok sabha constituency which is also his home district in the next general elections camping in begusarai he could be seen inaugurating kabaddi tournaments attending religious functions and seeking support for the october 25 bhaajpa bhagao desh bachao rally to be held at the historic gandhi maidan of patna however controversies continue to dog kanhaiya during his bihar sojourn he has already been booked on three accounts intimidating doctors and creating ruckus inside aiims patna attempt to murder and inciting riots around a durga puja pandal in begusarai and hurting religious sentiments of hindus in his speech kanhaiya though is unfazed and prepared for the long haul he labelled the attack by the bjp to project him as anti hindu before elections the young leader spoke to news18 about recent controversies related to him and his political strategy here are the edited excerpts from the interview q you claim your convoy was attacked on october 16 at bhagwanpur in begusarai what happened kanhaiya kumar we were returning from mansoorchak after attending a rally i was attacked near dahia village under bhagwanpur police station area by the supporters of the bjps youth wing and the bajrang dal you can easily identify them they have uploaded pictures with sushil modi on their social media accounts the attackers were patronised by a local bjp mlc rajneesh the intention was to cause harm to me and my colleagues q is it correct that you were not stopped by them but you got off there to meet one of your acquaintances which resulted in a traffic jam in front of a puja pandal kanhaiya kumar no they are two different issues the puja pandal was behind us there was quite a distance between where we stopped and the place of the puja a police escort party was with us you can ask them q locals told me that your followers armed with iron rods and hockey sticks attacked them they also say that your comment on goddess durga was in bad taste kanhaiya kumar can you expect that a person who is starting out in politics will indulge in such things and that too in his own constituency these are all lies and those you are referring to as locals are not common people but workers of the bjp and the bajrang dal this was a politically motivated attack to tarnish my image and project me as anti hindu they conspired to vitiate social harmony and one of the guys who was beaten up is not an apolitical person but a member of the bajrang dal had we been armed then 40 50 people would have been injured not one q how can you be sure that they were people from the rss and the bjp kanhaiya kumar because common people in dahia village are least concerned about this the bjp workers are fanning the fire you need to understand the history of dahia village i know very well because my ancestral home is just about a few kilometres away some families there have been with the rss for a long time bhagwanpur chowk is the only stronghold of the bajrang dal in begusarai all their senior leaders were at the spot just after five minutes how can this be possible q what happened at aiims patna kanhaiya kumar we went there to meet our aisf colleague sushil the hospital says i was with hundreds of supporters who scuffled with security guards and i misbehaved with doctors now my question is where is the cctv footage what is the evidence if somebody was injured then where is the injury report see its a conspiracy the official facebook page of aiims patna describes me as anti national kanhaiya can you expect a government body to brand me in such a way the doctors who filed an fir against me are associated with the bjp q bihars health minister and senior bjp leader mangal pandey has warned you saying bihar is not jnu what is your reaction kanhaiya kumar sometime back the same mangal pandey said he is not aware about any kanhaiya kumar now he is saying be cautious its not jnu but bihar how was he able to identify me now i have not developed any family relationship with him the fir was lodged by the doctors against me at his behest mlc rajneesh touches his feet whose goons attacked me in begusarai q how can you say everywhere people are conspiring against you kanhaiya kumar this is for everyone to see lawyers were manipulated against me in courts doctors were influenced to file a case the vice chancellor of jnu was tasked to scuttle my phd and now the bjp is using goddess durga against me but i am not afraid q what is the difference between campus and electoral politics what is the kind of feedback that you are getting in begusarai kanhaiya kumar the people here in begusarai are clever no one can fool them when sedition charges were slapped against me then also they stood behind me none can mislead them i will continue my political journey following the rule of the law my opponents first tried to brand me as an anti national and are now trying to prove that i a goonda hoodlum i will continue to follow the path i chose in the jnu campus i will not compromise with principles they bjp were defeated in the jnu and will face the same fate in begusarai,Real

apple iphone xr review the colourful iphone that sets up many questions,let us start with a thought that you might want to chew on for a bit how important is the display panel type when you are considering buying a phone as in are your eyes perfectly tuned to figure out the difference between an lcd and an oled screen or maybe even the fine differences between different types of oled screens if your answer is on the lines of yes very important then you can safely move on to reading another article on this website however if you are leaning towards not too important as long as it gets the job done you might want to stick around for a bit longer what we have on the agenda today is the new apple iphone xr this is the return of the colourful iphones after many years yes the iphone 5c was a long time ago this was also expected to be the truly affordable iphone this year which would in many ways run a calming hand over the fevered brow of those who otherwise find the iphones too expensive the complication however is that unlike the iphone x last year and the iphone xs and the iphone xs max this year and so on you simply knew you were getting an upgrade across all considerations you may have with the iphone xr it isn t that simple this is an iphone that makes you wait and look at it and deliberate and that is not just because of its beautiful colour options the first thing you need to consider is the price the iphone xr is priced at rs76 900 64gb rs81 900 128gb and rs91 900 256gb this is what many expected correctly or wrongly would be an affordable iphone the price at which the iphone xr lands in india does have to factor in the fairly volatile currency at the moment as well as local taxes and what not which means it isn t what many hoped it would be the exciting colours that the iphone xr is available in make it tough to choose a favorite there is the sophisticated blue a subtle white a comfortable black a chirpy yellow a cheerful coral and the gorgeous product red to choose from the colours will make this iphone stand out in a crowd from other iphones and any other phone for that matter the design language is the same as the iphone xs which means it is up to date on the design front apple iphone xr 2 the iphone xr doesn t compromise on the build quality and instead the combination of glass and metal that you will hold in your hand clearly has the same apple esque precision that we have come to expect the attention to detail is best explained by the fact that the inside of the lightning port on the phone also adorns the colour of the iphone xr the slight shine that the glass layer adds to the back makes colours such as coral sparkle very nicely incidentally the glass used on the iphone xr certainly doesn t catch as many fingerprints as last year s iphone x apple doesnt exactly say who makes the glass but the changes this time around have worked well that said the moment you pick up the iphone xr it feels a tad heavier than you expect some of it has to do with the display technology some of it has to do with the materials being used but the extra weight is noticeable initially to put numbers in perspective it is 17 grams heavier than the iphone xs and 16 grams lighter than the larger iphone xs max apple has downgraded the water and dust resistance rating on the iphone xr it is ip 67 as compared to ip 68 on the iphone xs and xs max to ip 67 this means that the iphone xr will be able to take a dip in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes and come away unscathed as against 2 meters of water for 30 minutes which the iphone xs and the iphone xs max can survive it is hard to miss the thicker black bezel running around the display notice that the bezel around the screen is ever so slightly thicker than the iphone xs devices but a lot of that also has to do with the lcd display backlighting as compared with the oled screens apple calls the iphone xr s lcd display as liquid retina it would perhaps be unfair to compare this with an oled screen on the iphone xs yes while this has a lower pixel density and resolution than the oled iphones it is still touching 326 pixels per inch this is the same as all iphones apart from the iphone x the iphone xs and the iphone xs max anyone upgrading from any other iphone apart from these three should not notice any difference at all as they use the iphone xr for the regular daily usage as far as the brightness colour vibrancy and sharpness are concerned this liquid retina display does the job it is rich to look at text looks great photo editing is immersive and there are very minimal reflections only however look at the display at an angle and the colour shift is quite perceptible something that wasnt the case with earlier lcd displays on previous generation iphones incidentally this liquid retina display does not support 3d touch could this be the first indication of the beginning of the end for this feature hard to say but the iphone xr could be indicating the future it is quite positive that the iphone xr isn t compromising at all in terms of the power it shares the same innards as the more expensive iphone xs and iphone xs max the powerful apple a12 bionic which is the first 7 nanometer chip in a smartphone is the heart and soul of the iphone xr too that means itll have the same level of computing prowess when it comes to the artificial intelligence algorithms including for portrait photos ar apps and animojis the iphone xr also has the same truedepth module too apple iphone xr 4 the sameness ends when we flip the iphone xr around the rear camera the single 12 megapixel camera with the f 1 8 aperture and smart hdr it has the same image processing algorithms as the iphone xs which means most photos should retain the same brilliance and level of detailing however the big change is this is one single optical hardware instead of the dual cameras that the other two iphones have smart hdr is a great tool to have and the way apple have optimized it we notice that it retains much more detail in the shadows for instance while the rest of the frame doesn t get blown out there is no secondary telephoto lens and you ll probably miss it of you are used to taking a lot of photos on zoom for someone who has been spoilt with the 2x optical zoom on the iphone x and beyond this takes some getting used to the bigger limitations are experienced with the portrait mode while the iphone xs and xs max combine the data captured by the wide angle lens and the telephoto lens the iphone xr s rear camera portrait mode relies heavily on software as things are this only works if it can detect a human face in the frame no it won t get conned by pets or soft toys or statues or bobbleheads at least in our experience if you want to take a portrait photo of an object or a thing that won t happen the camera app will tell you no person detected while the iphones with dual cameras have five portrait photography and editing modes the iphone xr has only three which means from natural light studio light contour light stage light and stage light mono the iphone xr eliminates stage light and stage light mono since there is no secondary optical hardware to provide additional photography data for these to work however you do get complete depth control which can be edited using the slider the same as the iphone xs and iphone xs max there are times when the software struggles a bit to do consistent mapping of the subject and edge detection struggles a bit whether you buy the iphone xr or not does not depend on the display or whether this offers a performance compromise instead it will totally hinge on whether you need the secondary rear camera for portrait and zoom photos if you are okay with the limited portrait mode and really like the yellow blue product red or coral colours the iphone xr is absolutely worth the experience but there is still the iphone x to consider and whether you really see value in an iphone xr over even last year s iphone x dual camera and very powerful a11 bionic chip to say that the iphone x is still an excellent iphone is surely a massive understatement,Real

pixelgate google pixel 3 and pixel 3 xl reliability issues just don t seem to stop,the google pixel 3 and the pixel 3 xl can not seem to catch a break as it turns out google s latest smartphones have some serious reliability issues one of the problems being reported is the familiar speaker buzzing a lot of early adopters are taking to social media platforms including twitter to suggest that the bottom speaker on the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 xl phones is producing a random buzzing noise mostly being reported by users to be audible at mid range frequencies being played back at low volumes it is not immediately clear whether the louder audio drowns out the sound or eliminates it altogether as you push up the volume the speaker lightly buzzes from 500 2500hz and buzzes very loudly at 20 500hz higher volumes can drown out the buzz but its still audible whereas lower volumes can make things almost unlistenable just typing on gboard and tapping through the ui creates a very noticeable buzz reports a user qtpa2tnh on reddit and he owns a pixel 3 xl this is the second issue to befall the speakers on google s newest phones earlier it was reported that the two speakers on the new pixel phones don t have the same audio output levels though google did take to reddit to clarify that this is by design it hasn t assuaged the fears hi all this is by design we specially designed speakers that allow for louder sound 40 louder than last year and better low frequency response we use new amplifier technology with advanced speaker protection algorithms to push these speakers harder and really get every last bit of performance out of them we also worked closely with the expert tuning of a grammy award winning music producer to enhance the audio in a way that plays to the strengths of the hardware system however users are not convinced i initially thought the top speaker was busted but no its just noticeably quieter than the bottom one said a user with the handle rayw reddit pixel 3 xl owner here i can confirm the imbalance is real the bottom speaker is much louder and better with bass and the top is definitely softer and slightly better with treble it doesnt bother me much if i tell myself google did that intentionally but why call them stereo asks another user mcnick0495 and it isn t just the buzzing speakers which are the problem for the new pixel phones a lot of users are reporting an issue with memory management on the new pixel phones apparently the background process for certain apps that are being used at the time get stopped if the user switches to another app temporarily this could be quite nasty with music or video streaming apps for instance this could be an issue with very aggressive process killing or the fact that the phone isn t holding more than a couple of apps temporarily in the ram at any given point of time that said google s decision to have 4gb of ram in the new pixel phones is surely not the reason for this but something more on the lines of poorly optimized task management the final trouble that users are reporting with the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 xl phones is that sometimes they do not save photos that you may have clicked using the default camera app this is despite the fact that a little preview appears at the bottom of the screen once you tap the shutter button suggesting the photo has been saved when it actually doesn t show up in the list of photos later it is not immediately known if this is a camera bug or an issue with how the photos app integrates with the camera on the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 xl this is a bit unfortunate considering how the pixel 2 xl phones from last year also struggled with certain issues such as speaker buzzing and a very muted display the magnitude of any potential hardware or software problems just gets expanded since the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 xl are largely running the same hardware except the differing display sizes for instance which wasn t exactly the case in the past year,Real
teens and europe are giving up on facebook but instagram is the surprise gainer,the tough year for facebook shows no signs of abating there really is no getting around the fact that people are leaving facebook perhaps as a fallout of all the scandals which have dented consumer confidence significantly teens are giving up on facebook those above the age of 50 simply don t understand how it works and europe is set to give facebook even more headaches according to estimates by financial services firm morgan stanley facebook s user base in europe may have stumbled by as much as 1 million owing to the new general data protection regulation gdpr which kicked in over the summer this would be a direct result of facebook requiring hundreds of millions of european users to either opt in to having data collected as per the new gdpr rules or stop using the site however in the midst of facebook s turmoil its sister app instagram is the big gainer the latest numbers shared by investment banking and asset management firm piper jaffray suggest that facebook s sister social network instagram has seen a spike in popularity and it is also hurting its biggest rival snapchat along the way the piper jaffray taking stock with teens survey numbers suggest that 85 percent of teens use instagram at least once per month compared with 84 percent for snapchat the instagram numbers are up from 81 percent same time last year though snapchat has also seen an increase from 82 percent in the same period of 2017 last month numbers released by pew research suggested that a whopping 44 percent of those ages 18 to 29 in the us suggest that they have deleted the facebook app from their phone in the past one year pew has surveyed 3 400 facebook users in may and june this year surely the cambridge analytica scandal which became public knowledge earlier this year would have been fresh in the minds of facebook users however it is a bit more complicated than that the research also suggested that 26 percent of the survey respondents confirmed to having deleted the facebook app 42 percent said that they were temporarily taking a break from the social media platform and 54 percent have adjusted their privacy settings there is another big challenge for facebook a lot of its users simply don t understand how the news feed works pew research 53 percent of us adults who use facebook do not understand how the news feed works how the content that they see is chosen to be there and why some content is given priority over other posts the same research suggests that only 38 percent of respondents above the age of 50 understand the dynamics of the facebook news feed they don t feel like they have a lot of agency or control over the content that they are getting and many of them have not actively attempted to change or shift that content that s particularly true for older users said aaron smith pews associate director of research on internet and technology issues in an official statement,Real

juventus too good for manchester united on ronaldos return,cristiano ronaldo emerged victorious again on his second return to old trafford but this time did not get on the scoresheet as juventus outclassed manchester united to win 1 0 in the champions league on tuesday instead ronaldo played a supporting role by helping set up paulo dybalas winner on 17 minutes as the italian champions opened up a five point lead over united at the top of group h jose mourinhos men were handed a break before kick off as valencias 1 1 draw away to young boys means united still hold a two point lead over the spaniards but a fourth defeat of the season will see speculation over mourinhos future increase once more but for a series of excellent saves from david de gea the margin of defeat could have been far greater too as any momentum united gained from fightbacks against newcastle and chelsea in recent weeks in the premier league faded away against one of the favourites to win the champions league ronaldo was given a heros welcome on his previous visit to old trafford with real madrid in 2013 after scoring 118 goals for united in six seasons between 2003 and 2009 to help the red devils win three premier league titles and the first of his five champions leagues the portugueses early days as juventus player since making the move to italy from madrid this summer have been overshadowed by a rape allegation made against him in the united states the five time ballon dor winner has strongly denied the allegation and been backed by his new club who paid 112 million euros 129 million for the 33 year old in july but the reception he received from the united faithful this time was far more muted with only a mild cheer raised when his name in the juventus line up was announced ronaldo scored the winner in a contentious champions league last 16 tie for madrid five years ago but this time played the role of provider for dybala to be the match winner his cross intended for juan cuadrado ricocheted kindly off chris smalling into the path of dybala to sweep the ball past de gea for his fourth goal in two champions league games as juventus dominated the rest of the first half only de gea stood in their way of killing the game off before the break the spaniard flew to his right to save joao cancelos fiercely struck shot then produced a fine double save to parry ronaldos free kick and swat away blaise matuidis follow up effort top scorer in this competition for the past six seasons ronaldo is still searching for his first champions league goal for juventus having been sent off after just 30 minutes of his european debut against valencia and subsequently banned for a 3 0 victory over young boys he couldnt have done much more with an effort that soared towards de geas top corner seven minutes into the second half only to see the united keeper produce a miraculous right handed save going behind brought out the best in mourinhos side against newcastle and chelsea to help ease the pressure on the manager but the hosts failed to threaten until paul pogbas curling shot from outside the box hit the post 15 minutes from time anthony martial also tested wojciech szczesny late on but juventus held out for a deserved victory,Real
aiff intent on restructuring indian football but road ahead remains unclear,ahead of the 2017 18 edition of the i league the biggest talking point among fans and experts alike was the fact that the all india football federation aiff had decided to keep the indian football team that featured in the fifa u 17 world cup together as the indian arrows in a bid to further develop the burgeoning talents yet perhaps the biggest elephant in the room the fact that the i league and the indian super league isl would be running simultaneously for the first time ahead of a major restructure of the domestic football system was not addressed at the time one year later and with the potential threat of an asian ban looming should they fail to unify the two leagues by the 2019 20 season the aiff unsurprisingly chose to address the issue head on let us look at the bigger picture we are talking about restructuring the league and we have a holistic plan for that where we are going to take all the leagues into account and make a better league structure so that india can perform better internationally aiff senior vice president subrata dutta said at the i league launch in new delhi on tuesday yet while it was refreshing to hear that the aiff were finally looking to merge the two domestic leagues there are a number of issues that must be addressed before the huge decision is finally taken earlier this year news broke of a fifa backed report that suggested an asian ban for indian clubs should they fail to come up with a unified league by the next season the report was refuted by aiff general secretary kushal das who stated that he was yet to receive any report from the asian football confederation afc and that a decision will be taken in due course complicated roadmap however coming up with a new system will be complicated to say the least considering the fact that an arrangement currently exists that sees the isl clubs get a 10 year immunity from relegation from 2014 onwards even though the fifa report called for a review of that and some other arrangements there is every possibility that it could be upheld even after it is evaluated by the necessary authorities this would mean that isl clubs will not be relegated from 2019 23 while i league clubs will be both promoted and relegated as the report stated that the new league must become a 16 team tournament by 2023 more tellingly this arrangement will see the majority of the i league clubs which include legacy sides like east bengal and mohun bagan among others excluded from the new merged league at least in the initial stages for his part dutta stated that it would be unwise to view the leagues individually as the plan was to eventually freshen up the whole domestic league system in india we should not analyse just one league we should include isl we should include i league and we should include age group leagues as well as think about the second division league since they all add value to football in our country dutta said yet to not view the isl and i league as separate entities given the differing natures of both tournaments is something of an exercise in futility one league has been in existence for only five years and has massive financial backing whereas the other began in 1996 as the national football league and features some of india s most successful clubs yet has never had the kind of exposure the new league did there s also the fact that i league clubs tend to enjoy better in stadium attendance something the isl has struggled with especially after the league began to run for longer than two months including the isl clubs in the revamped league structure makes sense given the amount of money that has been invested in them yet a truly holistic approach will be needed if the benefits of the reforms are to be enjoyed by all indian clubs,Real

aiff intent on restructuring indian football but road ahead remains unclear,ahead of the 2017 18 edition of the i league the biggest talking point among fans and experts alike was the fact that the all india football federation aiff had decided to keep the indian football team that featured in the fifa u 17 world cup together as the indian arrows in a bid to further develop the burgeoning talents yet perhaps the biggest elephant in the room the fact that the i league and the indian super league isl would be running simultaneously for the first time ahead of a major restructure of the domestic football system was not addressed at the time one year later and with the potential threat of an asian ban looming should they fail to unify the two leagues by the 2019 20 season the aiff unsurprisingly chose to address the issue head on let us look at the bigger picture we are talking about restructuring the league and we have a holistic plan for that where we are going to take all the leagues into account and make a better league structure so that india can perform better internationally aiff senior vice president subrata dutta said at the i league launch in new delhi on tuesday yet while it was refreshing to hear that the aiff were finally looking to merge the two domestic leagues there are a number of issues that must be addressed before the huge decision is finally taken earlier this year news broke of a fifa backed report that suggested an asian ban for indian clubs should they fail to come up with a unified league by the next season the report was refuted by aiff general secretary kushal das who stated that he was yet to receive any report from the asian football confederation afc and that a decision will be taken in due course complicated roadmap however coming up with a new system will be complicated to say the least considering the fact that an arrangement currently exists that sees the isl clubs get a 10 year immunity from relegation from 2014 onwards even though the fifa report called for a review of that and some other arrangements there is every possibility that it could be upheld even after it is evaluated by the necessary authorities this would mean that isl clubs will not be relegated from 2019 23 while i league clubs will be both promoted and relegated as the report stated that the new league must become a 16 team tournament by 2023 more tellingly this arrangement will see the majority of the i league clubs which include legacy sides like east bengal and mohun bagan among others excluded from the new merged league at least in the initial stages for his part dutta stated that it would be unwise to view the leagues individually as the plan was to eventually freshen up the whole domestic league system in india we should not analyse just one league we should include isl we should include i league and we should include age group leagues as well as think about the second division league since they all add value to football in our country dutta said yet to not view the isl and i league as separate entities given the differing natures of both tournaments is something of an exercise in futility one league has been in existence for only five years and has massive financial backing whereas the other began in 1996 as the national football league and features some of india s most successful clubs yet has never had the kind of exposure the new league did there s also the fact that i league clubs tend to enjoy better in stadium attendance something the isl has struggled with especially after the league began to run for longer than two months including the isl clubs in the revamped league structure makes sense given the amount of money that has been invested in them yet a truly holistic approach will be needed if the benefits of the reforms are to be enjoyed by all indian clubs,Real

kasautii zindagii kay of cgi flown dupattas and bad tv in the age of netflix,i was nine when kasautii zindagii kay premiered on national television despite being one among the countless ekta kapoor shows that had titles starting with k it nevertheless stood out for me in my juvenile head its story of star crossed lovers gave it the feel of a home grown shakespearean romance different from everything else that aired on tv then i remember watching it night after night until i could watch it no more today 17 years later i have long moved on but indian tv is stuck in time more garish and painfully uninspiring than ever when ekta kapoor first announced kasautii s reboot earlier this year the show s loyalists yes they exist rejoiced but a lot of us shuddered inwardly in 2001 a show like kasautii worked not because of its great content but essentially because indian audiences did not have many options however the world is starkly different today so is the audience and their sensibilities 10 minute long slo mo character introductions and cgi flown dupattas may have worked then but today they will be seen for what they are utterly ridiculous and will be called out too by the viewers who are largely a generation hard pressed on time that speaks its mind is known for dwindling attention and can not imagine a day in without netflix but ekta kapoor knows it already why do you think she launched her own streaming platform alt balaji otherwise trying to monetise the untapped potential in the indian web space she has been consistently populating it with original shows such as bose and home if she can put out such content on the web why discriminate against tv then it isn t just ekta though colors tv also has its own web streaming platform called voot which features interesting originals such as feet up with the stars and stupid man smart phone its television shows meanwhile are still lamentably limited to naagin which is now in its third season the horror and bigg boss now in its 12th season says it all interestingly despite global web streaming platforms wolfing a large share of the domestic entertainment space tv still is the most popular source of entertainment in india for it reaches even areas where the internet hasn t yet it offers content in regional languages a versatility which international media service providers are working towards but just because a clear divide is now emerging in who watches what is it fair to feed off it make viewers in jabalpur suffer through the saas bahu aur saazish type content on tv while simultaneously aspiring to grab the attention of the metro junta with content driven web shows so dear daily soap creators here s a request use new shiny bottles all you want but don t serve rotten old wine we may not all binge watch netflix or live in metro cities but we can tell also internet will eventually reach the remotest of india much like tv what then,Real

india has continued its repressive regime in the indian occupied kashmir iok through various machinations in this connection various forms of state terrorism have been part of a deliberate campaign by the indian army and paramilitary forces against the muslim kashmiris especially since 1989 it has been manifested in brutal tactics like crackdowns curfews illegal detentions massacre targeted killings sieges burning the houses torture disappearances rape breaking the legs molestation of muslim women and killing of persons through fake encounter according to a report on human rights violations in the indian occupied kashmir since 1989 there have been deaths of 1 00000 innocent kashmiris 7 023 custodial killings 1 22 771 arrests 1 05 996 destruction of houses or buildings 22 776 women widowed 1 07 466 children orphaned and 10 086 women gang raped molested indian brutal securities forces have continue these atrocities now the figures have increases as india state terrorism has continued unabated as a matter of fact indian forces have employed various draconian laws like the jammu and kashmir disturbed areas act and the armed forces jammu and kashmir special powers act and public safety act in killing the kashmiri people and for the arbitrarily arrest of any individual for an indefinite period besides human rights watch in its various reports amnesty international has also pointed out grave human rights violations in the indian controlled kashmir indicating the muslim majority population in the kashmir valley suffers from the repressive tactics of the security forces in its report on july 2 2015 the amnesty international has highlighted extrajudicial killings of the innocent persons at the hands of indian security forces in the indian held kashmir the report points out tens of thousands of security forces are deployed in indian administered kashmir the armed forces special powers act allows troops to shoot to kill suspected militants or arrest them without a warrant not a single member of the armed forces has been tried in a civilian court for violating human rights in kashmir this lack of accountability has in turn facilitated other serious abuses india has martyred one 100 000 people more than 8 000 disappeared while in the custody of army and state police in this respect european union has passed a resolution about human rights abuses committed by indian forces in the indian held kashmir it is also of particular attention that in 2008 a rights group reported unmarked graves in 55 villages across the northern regions of the indian held kashmir then researchers and other groups reported finding thousands of mass graves without markers in this respect in august 2011 indian jammu and kashmir state human rights commission officially acknowledged in its report that innocent civilians killed in the two decade conflict have been buried in unmarked graves particularly foreign sources and human rights organisations have revealed that unnamed graves include those innocent persons killed by the indian military and paramilitary troops in the fake encounters including those who were tortured to death by the indian secret agency raw in the recent past more unmarked graves have been discovered it is noteworthy that report of the united nations high commissioner for human rights ohchr released on june 14 2018 situation in kashmir pointed out indian atrocities in the iok it said from july 2016 the high commissioner for human rights has on numerous occasions requested the governments of india and pakistan that his office be given unconditional access to kashmir to assess the human rights situation india rejected this request while pakistan offered access the refusal to allow unhindered access to united nations team into indian administered kashmir gave rise to an idea of remote monitoring the report was then compiled by doing remote monitoring on the situation of human rights in kashmir the report by the independent authority is an eye opener for many the focus of the report is on the situation of human rights in the indian state of jammu and kashmir from july 2016 to april 2018 during this period ohchr received reports of allegations of widespread and serious human rights violations by indian security forces that led to numerous civilian casualties it is worth mentioning that in his address at the 73rd united nations general assembly unga on september 29 this year pakistan s foreign minister shah mehmood qureshi said the neighbouring country india rejected the pakistani offer of resuming peace talks on flimsy grounds we are ready to talk to india on all issues but with respect kashmir issue is the biggest obstacle to regional peace the indian forces subjecting kashmiris to atrocities for seven decades india should not test pakistan s patience we will respond to indian aggression the latest un report on the occupied kashmir has exposed indian atrocities on innocent civilians the meeting between the pakistani and indian foreign ministers would ve been a great opportunity for dialogue but the modi government chose politics over dialogue india would have to bear the brunt of pakistan s retaliation if it makes the mistake of any misadventure on the line of control loc it seems that indian authorities are not willing to talk with kashmiri people on political grounds new delhi reached to a conclusion that only bullet is the right way of dealing with kashmiris demanding their right of self determination surprisingly indian successive governments are trying to ignore the dynamics of the freedom movement of kashmiris for the sake of their alien rule nonetheless kashmir council eu kc eu launched the 11th annual week long event of kashmir eu week at european

why india accelerated ceasefire violations along the loc,by sajjad shaukat on the one hand india has accelerated ceasefire violations along the line of control loc but on the other hand it is accusing pakistan for the same by following the threatening diplomacy in this regard indian media including the times of india allegedly reported on october 1 this year in what will be read as a signal to the new government of imran khan prime minister narendra modi on sunday september 30 warned that the indian army will respond firmly to any ceasefire violation by pakistan and other provocative actions intended to disturb peace and spark violence our soldiers will give a befitting reply to whosoever makes an attempt to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our nation the pm s remarks on the officially promoted second anniversary of surgical strikes on terror launch pads in pakistan kashmir and in the backdrop of india s decision to cancel a meeting between indian and pakistani foreign ministers can indicate recourse to a tougher or more proactive response to violence along the loc the modi government has followed a policy of heavy retaliatory firing on the loc and the ib international border in j k jammu kashmir hindustan time wrote on september 30 2018 a day after a special police officer spo attached with legislator from wachi ajaz mir decamped with seven rifles and one pistol from the official residence of the legislator at high security zone jawhar nagar the j k director general of police dgp said that the spo was in touch with the militants we have found that the spo had joined the other side militants police will take action against all those found involved in dereliction of their duties it is mentionable that indian prime minister narendra modi s extremist party bjp had got a land sliding triumph in the indian elections 2014 on the basis of anti muslim and anti pakistan slogans therefore since the prime minister modi came to power he has been implementing anti muslim and anti pakistan agenda with the support of fanatic coalition outfits now same slogans based policy has become the bjp strategy to win the indian general elections 2019 in this context in her speech at the 73rd united nations general assembly unga indian external affairs minister sushma swaraj s had slammed pakistan on september 29 this year by raising false allegations of infiltration in the indian controlled kashmir and of harbouring terrorists reacting strongly to indian external affairs minister sushma swaraj s verbal attack on pakistan pakistan s foreign minister shah mehmood qureshi on september 29 2018 said in his address at unga the neighbouring country rejected the pakistani offer of resuming peace talks on flimsy grounds india is exporting terrorism to pakistan and other countries in the region kulbhushan jadhav is an example of india exporting terrorism to its neighbouring countries qureshi maintained that pakistan wanted ties with india based on mutual respect by adding we are ready to talk to india on all issues but with respect kashmir issue is the biggest obstacle to regional peace the indian forces subjecting kashmiris to atrocities for seven decades india should not test pakistan s patience we will respond to indian aggression the latest un report on the occupied kashmir has exposed indian atrocities on innocent civilians the meeting between the pakistani and indian foreign ministers would ve been a great opportunity for dialogue but the modi government chose politics over dialogue india would have to bear the brunt of pakistan s retaliation if it makes the mistake of any misadventure on the line of control loc indian external affairs minister sushma swaraj s address has disappointed congress leader shashi tharoor who feels that all the pakistan bashing in new york was aimed at the bjp voters his other objection to her speech on saturday september 29 was that it did not portray india in a good light it is mentionable that report of the united nations high commissioner for human rights ohchr released on june 14 2018 situation in kashmir is pointed out indian atrocities in the indian occupied kashmir iok it said from july 2016 the high commissioner for human rights has on numerous occasions requested the governments of india and pakistan that his office be given unconditional access to kashmir to assess the human rights situation india rejected this request while pakistan offered access the refusal to allow unhindered access to united nations team into indian administered kashmir gave rise to an idea of remote monitoring the report was then compiled by doing remote monitoring on the situation of human rights in kashmir the report by the independent authority is an eye opener for many the focus of the report is on the situation of human rights in the indian state of jammu and kashmir from july 2016 to april 2018 during this period ohchr received reports of allegations of widespread and serious human rights violations by indian security forces that led to numerous civilian casualties nevertheless kashmir has become achilles heels for india since the publishing of the united nations human rights on situation in kashmir indian frustration has increased manifolds india attempted to ventilate the frustration by hollow claims and usual allegations against pakistan as noted at unga s recent session on the contrary islamabad used a decent and mature posture to project the sufferings and struggle of innocent kashmiri people against unlawful occupation of iok pakistan s mature stance has even attracted appreciation of indian external affairs expert like shashi tharoor who censured speech of india s external affairs minister sushma swaraj failing to get acknowledgement in unga new delhi has started accusing pakistan for failure in resumption of dialogue on the contrary it was india which avoided resuming dialogue on petty pretexts it is mentionable that indian army chief bipin rawat on september 22 this year threatened pakistan with retaliation over its alleged involvement in killing of a border guard and policemen in the indian occupied kashmir iok indian electronic media quoted gen rawat as saying we need to take stern action to avenge the barbarism that terrorists and pakistan army have been carrying out and threatened surprise attack surgical strike on pakistan teaching pakistan a lesson the remarks come a day after new delhi called off a meeting scheduled for talks between the foreign ministers of pakistan and india on the same day reacting to the indian army chief s threat and reckless remarks the director general of inter services public relations ispr maj gen asif ghafoor advised india not to get into war mongering as a ruse to deflect international challenges pakistan is a nuclear nation and is ready to give a befitting reply to any misadventure pakistan s desire for peace should not be taken for weakness pakistan is a peace loving country and has played an unparalleled role as forces of peace in the region warning india of stern military repercussions and urging indian army chief to abstain from deteriorating peace situation maj gen ghafoor added war is never a solution to any problem pakistan has always positively responded to all peace initiatives it s india who backs out from the dialogue indian army has been indulged in its country s politics in the wake of corruption scandals the indian government is under criticism internally from the opposition on various corruption scams and failure of economic agenda such statements are attempts to divert domestic narrative towards pakistan india is trying to divert attention from the domestic problem and is resorting to baseless propaganda no pakistani troop was involved in the mutilation of an indian soldier regarding indian ceasefire violations across the loc in the recent past the dg of ispr said indian army started unprovoked firing along the loc in different sectors targeting civilian populations pakistan army troops responded effectively to indian ceasefire violations and targeted those posts which had initiated unprovoked firing similarly pakistan s foreign office fo spokesperson dr muhammad faisal stated that so far in 2018 indian forces carried out more than 150 ceasefire violations along the loc and the working boundary in just 20 days resulting in the death of nine innocent civilians in 2017 more than 1 300 indian ceasefire violations the highest ever in the recent past have resulted in 52 deaths and 175 were injured the ceasefire violations by india are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation the fo spokesperson urged india to respect the 2003 ceasefire arrangement he added the indian side should permit the united nations military observer group in india and pakistan unmogip to play its mandated role as per the un security council resolutions ceasefire violations are a frequent feature along the loc and working boundary despite the leadership of pakistan rangers and india s border security forces agreeing in november 2017 that the spirit of a 2003 ceasefire agreement must be revived to protect innocent lives surprisingly on september 24 2018 indian army chief rawat again threatened pakistan by saying that i want another surgical strike on terror launch pads across the line of control loc time is ripe for such action but i will not disclose how we intend to go about it on the other side talking to media in london on october 13 this year dg of ispr maj gen asif ghafoor stated pakistan will launch 10 times if india launches one surgical strike it is noteworthy that a leading newspaper of pakistan wrote on september 30 2018 the current hardening of position by the government of india is directly linked to its general elections which are due early next year the ruling bjp can not afford to be seen soft on terror a frightening bogey which has been created and which in india is now synonymous with pakistan this intransigence and refusal to engage and talk has not only held the people of kashmir hostage but by placing the region on the dangerous trajectory that it is currently moving on it is a threat to the people of both the countries kashmir stands as a potential nuclear flashpoint between them which will consume the lives of millions of people in an instant nonetheless as per instructions of the prime minister modi indian forces have accelerated ceasefire violations along the loc as modi wants to divert the attention of indians from the domestic problems and scandals such as corruption etc another major purpose of the bjp led government is to malign pakistan and its security agencies by creating war hysteria inside india to win the forthcoming elections sajjad shaukat writes on international affairs and is author of the book us vs islamic militants invisible balance of power

india the most opportunist ally of russia and the us,machiavelli advises the rulers to have a lion like image outwardly and act upon the traits of goat inwardly in his sense a good ruler should be a good opportunist and hypocrite while echoing machiavelli morgenthau points out that sometimes rulers act upon immoral activities like deceit fraud and falsehood to fulfill their selfish aims in one way or the other these political philosophers also favour double game as part of shrewd diplomacy but india is openly acting upon the discarded theories of the past political thinkers in the modern era which have proved that india is the most opportunist ally of russia and the unites states in this regard during russian president vladimir putin s two day visit to india russian president putin and indian prime minister narendra modi who also took part in the russian indian business forum and apart from other agreements signed on october 5 this year the 5 billion s 400 air defence system deal amid a threat of sanctions from the us prime minister modi said in a joint address with putin russia has stood by india through time and has played a crucial role in india s growth story russia has been an important supplier of defence hardware to india for decades however the s 400 is one of the world s most advanced long range air defence systems china was the first nation to buy the s 400 missile system in 2014 the us has hinted at tough sanctions against any nation that buys advanced military hardware from russia under a new law countering america s adversaries through sanctions act caatsa the us imposes sanctions on any country that has significant transactions with iran north korea or russia india had already indicated that it will go ahead with the purchase of s 400 deal notwithstanding the us sanctions in this regard indian air chief marshal bs dhanoa has told media as and when the government approves it delivery of the missiles will be in 24 months ignoring america s sanctions over s 400 deal indian army chief bipin rawat said india follows independent policy when president putin reached new delhi a propaganda campaign had started against pakistan by the indian media in this respect under the caption putin arrives in india today pak terror s 400 missile deal on agenda india today wrote on october 4 2018 besides the missile deal putin and prime minister narendra modi will discuss the issue of security challenges in the afpak afghanistan pakistan region and the threat of terrorism that emanates from pakistan the modi administration has been engaged with russia regarding the defence cooperation between moscow and islamabad and why is there a need to have such cooperation press trust of india revealed on october 3 2018 india and russia will hold a joint military exercise from november 18 to 28 2018 in uttar pradesh russian authorities said wednesday october 3 ahead of president vladimir putin s visit to new delhi the exercise indra 2018 will see participation of about 250 servicemen of motorised infantry units of russia s eastern military district emd according to a statement by the emd under the title can india control pak s airspace with russian s 400 missile defence systems eurasia times wrote on october 4 this year india is fully prepared to buy the s 400 missile defense systems from russia despite continued us pressure and persistence secondly what impact will the s 400 systems create on arch rivals pakistan in response to this question a senior defence expert said it is very worrisome for pakistan after the s 400 arrives india can literally control the airspace of pakistan especially the bordering regions the defence expert also stated that india started to procure weapons from the united states and in response defence relations between pakistan and russia gradually started to grow india feared that pakistan would also demand s 400 from russia as india is increasing her bonhomie with us the pinned expectations with the visit of the president putin was exaggerated in the backdrop that american president trump had last month signed an executive order paving the way for slapping crippling sanctions on countries and foreign entities and individuals violating the caatsa in the same background indian agreement with moscow for purchase of the latest defence equipment seems unrealistic and a political ploy of modi s government which shows that india is an opportunist ally earlier to the visit of president putin some segments of the indian media have also pointed out that indian leadership might raise issue of russia s pak approach it is notable that the signing of logistics exchange memorandum of agreement lemoa between india and the usa was a watershed moment in defense cooperation between the two countries the agreement approves the two militaries to share each other s base for various operations including joint exercise joint training humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts the pact enhanced india s military capability and now india can have access to america s network of military bases having strategic locations in fact extremist government of modi is deceiving both the rival countries russia and the us by following strategy of fundamentalist hindus chanakya say something else and do something else while indicating indo russia relations even some indian media reports including those of the western countries have said that these ties exposed the indian duplicitous role ditching russia by citing lemoa other agreements with the us and undue preferences for the us regarding the russia india defence deal indian the economic times wrote on october 8 2018 s 400 deal gives u s a unique chance to spell out special relations with india india s decision to purchase the s 400 triumf missile defence system from russia has handed the us a unique strategic opportunity to distinguish india from china on their dealings with russia sanctions for beijing waiver for new delhi but will the us make this call already some washington lobbyists are pitching an even handed application of the countering america s adversaries through sanctions act caatsa sanctions were imposed on chinese entities only last month for the s 400 deal so how can us president donald trump make an exception for exactly the same offence even if he has the authority to grant a waiver analysts opined that in the backdrop of growing indo us bonhomie and lemoa etc perception about india becoming a client state of us was solidifying moreover under the same syndrome india was also drifting away from the cold war ally russia as new delhi is part of few regional and international alliances having a strong russian role she badly needed to neutralize the perception with some activity to prove her independent status in the same background india re engaged russia by signing multi billion dollar deal of s 400 surface to air missile system apparently there is no immediate response from the usa over indo russia deal however the analysts feel that american annoyance will be unleashed under countering america s adversaries through sanctions act caatsa to test india as a matter of fact india us friendship is based upon mutual deceptions as india is uncomfortable with america and the americans are feeling that indians are unreliable as partners it is mentionable that prior to putin s trip to india the us on october 2 2018 urged new delhi to forgo its proposed deal to buy the s 400 missile defence system from moscow warning that the deal could attract american sanctions president donald trump has the power to waive these sanctions for specific countries and specific transactions and us officials have repeatedly stated in the recent past that india should not expect an automatic waiver if it goes ahead with the purchase from russia in this context a state department spokesperson told newspaper the hindu that this waiver might not be available to india and the s 400 deal falls in the category of sanctionable transactions we urge all of our allies and partners to forgo transactions with russia that would trigger sanctions under caatsa the administration has indicated that a focus area for the implementation of caatsa section 231 is new or qualitative upgrades in capabilit including the s 400 air and missile defense system recently india has ordered defence equipment worth 18 billion from the us notably during the cold war era india joined the russian block and extracted maximum benefits from the former soviet union but after the disintegration of the former soviet union gradually new delhi left the former russia and started strengthening her relations with the us which emerged as the sole superpower the main aim behind was also to extract maximum benefits from america it is of particular attention that during his first visit to new delhi on november 6 2010 president barack obama announced the measures america would take regarding removal of indian space and defence companies from a restricted entities list and supported indian demand membership of four key global nuclear nonproliferation regimes and as part of the double standards in relation to india and pakistan america set aside the indian poor record regarding the safety of nuclear weapons and related materials despite indian violations of various international agreements and its refusal to sign non proliferation treaty npt comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt and additional protocol with the international atomic energy agency iaea washington signed a pact of nuclear civil technology with new delhi in 2008 during american president barack obama s visit to india on january 25 2016 the us and india announced a breakthrough on the pact which would allow american companies to supply new delhi with civilian nuclear technology especially america is a potential military supplier to india us also pressurized iaea and the nuclear suppliers group nsg to grant a waiver to new delhi for obtaining civil nuclear trade on larger scale in the pretext of countering china washington has continued favouring india s programme of advancement and modernization of nuclear weapons america supports indian nuclear programme as part of anti china and anti pakistan approach beijing is apprehensive about the emerging threat as during the last visit of obama to new delhi the intent of president obama and indian prime minister modi was quite clear while mentioning about free sea lanes and air passages in the south

information minister fawad chaudhry also expressed almost similar feelings and gave a matching response to the indian army chief s threat as a matter of fact new delhi seems to be totally perplexed that compels her to stage dramas such like events this time a fictional and illusory story of beheading of an india soldier followed by beheading of pakistani soldiers that are not showcased in a television interview defence minister of india nirmala sitharaman said that the security forces are giving befitting replies to the pakistani soldiers across the border she added that the army is cutting off several heads of the pakistani soldiers in retaliation to the beheading of one indian soldier such concocted stories are framed by most of the indian top brass including media persons this statement was later towed by the indian army chief bipin rawat as already mentioned surprisingly on september 24 2018 indian army chief rawat again threatened pakistan by saying that i want another surgical strike on terror launch pads across the line of control loc time is ripe for such action but i will not disclose how we intend to go about it in fact there many reasons of pak india border tensions which have deepened due to irresponsible policies of new delhi in this respect in the recent past visit of us secretary of state mike pompeo to new delhi proved inconclusive as there were many sticks this time in the shape of indian defense deal to buy the russian s 400 missile defense system with russia and india s initiatives with iran i e energy sector deals and chabahar port the us has imposed economic sanctions on russia and iran while american president donald trump has repeatedly stated that washington would impose sanctions on any country which concludes agreements with these countries it is of particular attention that russian president vladimir putin reached india on thursday october 4 2018 indian media reported that during his visit moscow and new delhi signed on friday october 5 2018 the 5 billion s 400 air defence system deal and india could face american sanctions earlier during pompeo s visit to islamabad the us and pakistan vowed to review their strained relations positively in this regard during his recent trip to the united states pakistan s foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi met american top officials including president trump and us secretary of state mike pompeo especially quereshi s meeting with pompeo was very successful both the leaders reiterated pakistan s support for a political settlement in afghanistan noting that the use of force had failed to deliver results they agreed that the time was ripe for the afghan taliban to avail the opportunity for a political settlement by seizing the opportunity for dialogue they stressed that peace in south asia which was a common goal of both the us and pakistan would remain elusive until all disputes including the core dispute of jammu and kashmir are resolved welcoming pakistan s foreign minister to the state department secretary pompeo said the united states looked forward to working with the new government of pakistan in implementing its reform agenda the two leaders agreed to remain engaged with a view to achieving their shared bilateral and regional objectives however these developments irritated india it is notable that indian prime minister narendra modi s extremist party bjp had got a land sliding triumph in the indian elections 2014 on the basis of anti muslim and anti pakistan slogans therefore since the prime minister modi came to power he has been implementing anti muslim and anti pakistan agenda with the support of fanatic coalition outfits now same slogans based policy has become the bjp strategy to win the indian general elections 2019 that is why firing by the indian army and border security force bsf across the loc has been accelerated targeting the innocent civilians and their property in pakistani side of kashmir and working boundary hence border tension has deepened between pakistan and india new delhi has ignored that fact that both the countries are nuclear powers so loc tension needs appropriate analysis as it has raised the question does india wants atomic war in this connection in a recent statement the ispr spokesman said indian army started unprovoked firing along the loc in different sectors targeting civilian populations pakistan army troops responded effectively to indian ceasefire violations and targeted those posts which had initiated unprovoked firing similarly pakistan s foreign office fo spokesperson dr muhammad faisal stated that pakistan had summoned the acting indian deputy high commissioner to lodge a protest over the killing of civilians in azad jammu and kashmir he elaborated that so far in

of india wrote on february 6 2018 in the absence of any diplomatic detente the deadly war of attrition between india and pakistan along the 778 km line of control loc and 198 km international boundary ib in jammu kashmir has taken a sharp turn nevertheless border tension along the loc can not be seen in isolation as it is part of interrelated developments which may lead to atomic war between pakistan and india since july 8 2016 indian security forces have martyred more than 700 innocent persons in the indian occupied kashmir iok who have been protesting against the martyrdom of the young kashmir leader burhan wani and for liberation of their land kashmiri freedom fighters are demanding their legitimate right of self determination as recognized by the un resolutions they have accelerated their legitimate struggle in the aftermath of the martyrdom of burhan wani in wake of sieges and prolonged curfews including arrests and detentions of the kashmir leaders meanwhile on setember18 2016 india staged the drama of the terror attack in the indian held kashmir ihk at a military base in uri close to the loc with pakistan by manipulating the false flag terror assault the bjp led indian prime minister modi also intensified war hysteria against pakistan and instructed indian forces to continue shelling across the loc notably islamabad also exposed the myth of indian surgical strikes inside azad kashmir which also depressed new delhi notably new delhi s main aim is to deflect the attention of the international community from the new phase of kashmiri intifada while pressure has been mounting on the modi government both domestically and internationally to resolve the issue of kashmir with pakistan india which has strategic partnership with israel and america has perennially been manipulating the double game of the us led west regarding world phenomena of terrorism in connection with pakistan and afghanistan while exploiting their anti muslim approach to obtain indo israeli american clandestine designs emboldened by the fanatic president trump india has continued shelling in pakistani side of kashmir which remains a nuclear flashpoint

solution of kashmir was war as there is no peaceful democratic solution responding to the withdrawal of the us led nato forces from afghanistan he remarked americans will hand over afghanistan to

modi s new gimmick of gagging political opponents for the upcoming elections,recently the government led by indian prime minister narendra modi and leader of the extremist ruling party bharatiya janata party bjp unleashed wave of oppressive measures against liberals dalit activists journalists and lawyers who were critical of government policies these measures including some other ones are part of the pre election strategy to be held in 2019 in maharashtra advocate surendra gadling english professor shoma sen writer sudhir dhawale forest rights activist mahesh raut and prisoners rights

enmity between communities through bhima koregaon violence and conspiring to murder prime minister modi such moves are part of bjp s 2019 poll strategy to gag the dissenting voice with state power some impartial analysts believe that the current specter being created of a vast and ever expanding urban maoist network through an active collaboration between the police and some television channels are like a fast forward to fascism indian intelligentsia feels that the aim is to silence those who have raised their voice against the abuse of state power and to warn others against opening their

autocratic government india under modi legal fraternity people like retired justice of indian supreme court mr katju said that the perpetrators of crime have violated article 21 of the constitution

the next general election bharatiya janata party bjp seems to be refashioning its strategy to gear up to the challenge of 2019 with a much reduced credibility for 2014 it employed a more congress style accommodative politics within the larger grid of a populist strategy creating a narrative of us versus them essentially to target the religious minorities and portray them as the outsiders this was coupled with the credibility crisis facing the congress the party also had the advantage of narendra modi s image who at the time was seen as a decisive leader who could deliver dramatic results many of these advantages are now on the wane bjp realises it can not repeat the magic figures in much of north india and also perhaps in the west the initial strategy was to compensate the loss with some compensation in the east spreading to bengal and other parts of the northeastern states similarly bjp wished to spread its hold in the southern states too the prospect of notching up even a simple majority looks to be a herculean task at the moment for the bjp going by the shift in its political discourse in the recent past they seem to have decided to give up the old kind of accommodative politics in favour of a new kind of polarisation which involves more than bothering of muslims what is new is that the bjp has given up on dalit votes too the bjp will continue to practice the policy of sub dividing dalits in order to gain votes of smaller dalit sub castes that have remained unrepresented krishna madiga a robust madiga leader from telangana has been campaigning nation wide to put the issue of sub division of scheduled castes on the national agenda this may yield some results but more crucial seems to be the strategy of combining dalits muslims and left liberals as the new combined other in order to achieve this it is beginning to draft a new narrative that is more explicitly critical of the dalits along with the muslims bhima koregaon was the first salvo they fired to consolidate this narrative further the projected link between dalits and jihad islam is the next layer of this new polarisation as part of this they have claimed that jignesh mevani received funding from islamic groups and now it is rohith vemula s mother who is being condemned for allegedly receiving help from the iuml these two layers are then being used to suggest links between jihadi islamic groups dalits and the maoists to symbolise the left the recent claims of a possible a possible maoist attack being planned against modi further reinforce such an implication maoist and jihadi link has been mentioned in the case of the bhima koregaon incident all of these will be now be stitched to the kashmiri separatists and militancy in the valley with the pulling out of the government in jammu and kashmir bjp is attempting to entrench the image of muslims as essentially being ungrateful and unreasonable in spite of the repeated attempts of the party to appease them kashmiris performing well in the upsc one of them even represented the indian cricket team another symbol of jingoistic nationalism and the declaration of ceasefire during ramzan this bjp feels has set the stage to consolidate the sense of violation among the majority hindus alongside consolidating the upper caste vote bank by isolating the dalits congress is being projected as being soft on muslim fundamentalism dalit aggression and a national threat from the left oriented political groups such as the maoists these three groups along with kashmiris represent the impending national security threat tacitly supported by the congress with the saturation of leadership positions in the regional party smaller groups among the obcs other backward classes scheduled casts and scheduled tribes have steadily moved to the bjp and remained a potent force obcs have got increasingly drawn into the communal anti muslim rhetoric for various reasons including the need to fit into hyper masculine claims that figuratively draw them closer to the way kshatriyas self represent themselves hyper nationalist discourse allows space for these not so visible cultural traits to find a legitimate social narrative it is mentionable that regarding the forthcoming elections bjp led indian government and media which are in collusion have also started a propaganda campaign against pakistan s armed forces and the inter services intelligence isi there is also a co relation between the hindu fundamentalist parties such as bjp rss and indian secret agency raw since distorting the image of pakistan is the agenda of raw therefore it suits bjp and its militant wing the rss in this connection reportedly some quarters of indian media have started to hurl another ugly allegation that pak s intelligence agency isi will attempt to sabotage indian polls of 2019 as well,Fake
indian insecure nuclear programme threatening regional and global peace,in its report the stockholm international peace research institute sipri disclosed on 18 this year that an estimated 110 130 indian nuclear bombs are stored in six or so government run sites across india within the next five years to one decade as many as 60 reactors will also be functional in india with the active cooperation of the us led western and far eastern allies in the past several incidents of leakage and theft in addition to alarming episodes of lax security on existing nuclear sites in view of a history of civil tumult have occurred in india india is notorious for highly lax security of its nuclear facilities the episode of 8 october 2014 at kalpakkam when a soldier of central industrial security force cisf responsible for protecting nuclear materials went on a rampage to destroy the security of the facility leading to nuclear material theft by criminals this and many incidents in the past including theft and leakage incidents of 2003 2008 2009 and 2013 are alarming examples of what inside and outside officials depict as serious short comings in india s nuclear safeguards india and japan have a bad record of nuclear reactor leakage due to various reasons which consequently proved disastrous but indian poor nuclear security has broken all the records indian media reported on july 5 this year that the kolkata police have arrested five men with 1 kg of uranium valued at around rs 3 crores 440 000 the times of india elaborated that the men had come to kolkata in the state of west bengal to try to sell the substance police were quoted as saying that two packets of a yellow coloured substance were seized it is notable that when the us former president barack obama hosted the fourth nuclear security summit in washington on march 31 2016 to check the spread of nuclear weapons showing concerns about the ambitions of terrorist groups such as the isis in acquiring a nuclear weapon or radioactive material the us president donald trump had taken a different stand in his interview with the cnn by stating more nuclear weapons could make the world safer us can no longer afford to bankroll the defense of its allies in europe asia and the middle east japan south korea and saudi arabia may need arsenals to confront threats in their region on their own similarly by pursuing the double standards of america and some western countries in its worst form president trump also favoured india while opposing the nuclear weapons of pakistan because being the only nuclear country in the islamic world pakistan annoys the us israel and some western countries as a matter of fact it is zionist agenda to denculearise pakistan however like obama trump has brushed aside the ground realities that indian prime minister narendra modi led by the ruling fundamentalist party bjp has been implementing anti muslim and anti pakistan agenda as part of their double game these us led countries have ignored indian poor record of nuclear security non proliferation lack of safety of workers working at indian nuclear facilities and lack of any appropriate regulatory authority indian past record proves various kinds of security and safety lapses regarding various nuclear plants and the related sensitive materials including events of leakage nuclear theft smuggling and killing in this regard in november 2009 more than 90 indian workers suffered radiation due to contamination of drinking water at the kaiga atomic power station in karnataka on july 27 1991 a similar event occurred at the heavy water plant run by the department of atomic energy at rawatbhata in rajasthan nuclear radiation had affected and injured many laborers there in july 1998 india s central bureau of investigation cbi seized eight kg of nuclear material from three engineers in chennai which was stolen from an atomic research center on november 7 2000 international atomic energy agency iaea disclosed that indian police had seized 57 pounds of uranium and arrested two men for illicit trafficking of radioactive material iaea had revealed that indian civil nuclear facilities were vulnerable to thefts on january 26 2003 cnn pointed out that indian company nec engineers private ltd shipped 10 consignments to iraq containing highly sensitive equipments entailing titanium vessels and centrifugal pumps in december 2006 a container packed with radioactive material had been stolen from an indian fortified research atomic facility near mumbai in june 2009 india s nuclear scientist lokanathan mahalingam missed from the scenario and after a couple of days his dead body was recovered from the kali river indian police concocted a story that mahalingam had committed suicide by jumping into the river it is a big joke to hide some real facts behind his death because wisdom proves that if an educated person decides to commit suicide he will definitely adopt a soft way to eliminate his life afterwards dr haleema saadia said that death of the scientist was a conspiracy nevertheless such events in connection with nuclear material continued unabated in india putting the security of atomic weapons and their related components including the lives of workers at high risk it is mentionable that during his first visit to new delhi on november 6 2010 president obama announced the measures america would take regarding removal of indian space and defence companies from a restricted entities list and supported indian demand membership of four key global nuclear nonproliferation regimes and as part of the double standards in relation to india and pakistan america set aside the indian poor record regarding the safety of nuclear weapons and related materials despite indian violations of various international agreements and its refusal to sign non proliferation treaty npt comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt and additional protocol with the iaea washington signed a pact of nuclear civil technology with new delhi in 2008 during americanpresident barack obama s visit to india on january 25 2016 the us and india announced a breakthrough on the pact which would allow american companies to supply new delhi with civilian nuclear technology notably america is a potential military supplier to india us also pressurized iaea and the nuclear suppliers group nsg to grant a waiver to new delhi for obtaining civil nuclear trade on larger scale evidences indicate that india has not fulfilled the conditions of the nsg waiver at least eight of india s nuclear reactors are outside safeguards which are a big question mark on the credibility of its nuclear safety and security standards two reports from the king s college respectively titled india s nuclear exceptionalism and india s strategic nuclear and missile program also claim that india has already accumulated nuclear material for over 2600 nuclear weapons including all of its unsafeguarded reactor grade plutonium which is weapon usable and raised concerns over this stockpiling in fact in the pretext of countering china washington has continued favouring india s programme of advancement and modernization of nuclear weapons us supports indian nuclear programme in the pretext of anti china and anti pakistan approach beijing is apprehensive about the emerging threat as during the last visit of obama to new delhi the intent of president obama and indian prime minister modi was quite clear while mentioning about free sea lanes and air passages in the south china sea president trump is also pursuing the policy of his predecessor in this respect as in the recent past during his meeting with prime minister modi he showed similar approach nonetheless arms deals with america which also include nuclear submarines to new delhi would increase indian hegemonic designs in the region and nsg s membership of india will create concerns for regional strategic stability besides obtaining atomic weapons from the us and other western countries new delhi is clandestinely importing nuclear arms components and submarines from tel aviv in this connection zionist led indo israeli secret diplomacy could be assessed from the interview of israel s ambassador to india mark sofer published in the indian weekly outlook on february 18 2008 regarding india s defense arrangements with tel aviv sofer had surprisingly revealed we do have a defense relationship with india and with all due respect the secret part will remain a secret although these atomic weapons seem to be mysterious yet still could be within the reach of some hindu terrorists with the help of raw which might have also got these destructive arms from mossad such atomic weapons or radiological materials could have also been smuggled inside india by the hindu fundamentalists with the covert assistance of raw frustrated in isolating islamabad raw in connivance with mossad might have prepared a most dangerous plan to use nuclear weapons or dirty nuclear bombs inside the us homeland or any major european country to implicate pakistan for having allegedly used these weapons through some taliban militants particularly raw and mossad may also employ these fatal weapons against nato forces in afghanistan as india and israel want to prolong the stay of the us led nato troops in afghanistan which have become the center of their covert activities against pakistan russia china and iran terrorists of the islamic state outfit also known as daesh isis and isil which are strategic assets of the cia may be used by raw and mossad for employment of these unconventional weapons while india israel and america are also playing double game against one another hence by utilizing the vicious circle of terrorism new delhi can alone use these weapons through afghanistan based tehreek e taliban pakistan ttp and isis which are also being backed by raw cia and mossad and have claimed responsibility for several terror assaults inside pakistan and afghanistan including the recent ones so raw s sole aim will be to provoke americans and its allies against islamabad which is challenging indian hegemony in the region thus indian raw could create a dangerous misunderstanding in which us could use small nuclear weapons against pakistan or could ask the latter of rollback its atomic programme undoubtedly in such an environment considering india qualified for acquiring of nuclear technology through global powers led nsg and iaea and obstructing pakistan s safe nuclear energy programme is discriminatory as well as an effort to hinder peace and economic progress of pakistan and unsafe materials in nuclear facilities patrolled by low morale cisf troops across india are also liable to be stolen by insiders having grievances against employers and typical hindu mindset of indian leadership these stolen materials could be used by indian sponsored isis elements washington and its other allies instead of pressing india for quick nuclear reforms are encouraging india to expand its nuclear stockpiles the us led west need to take cognizance of such ventures rather than criticizing pak china civil nuclear cooperation in light of these negative developments we can conclude that indian insecure nuclear programme is threatening regional and global peace therefore world s various forums such as eu and uno including russia should also take cognizance of new delhi in this regard sajjad shaukat writes on international affairs and is author of the book us vs islamic militants invisible

double game is the bjp election strategy,indian prime minister narendra modi s extremist party bharatiya janata party bjp had got a land sliding triumph in the indian elections 2014 on the basis of anti muslim and anti pakistan slogans therefore since the prime minister modi came to power he has been implementing anti muslim and anti pakistan agenda with the support of fanatic coalition outfits now double game has become the bjp strategy to win the indian general elections 2019 in this regard bjp leadership seems to have geared up its activity for forthcoming poll 2019 party s chief strategist amit shah is deliberately fanning feelings of communalism in the indian states having muslim voters whereas in other states dalit and other lower schedule caste people are instigated to create an exploitable poll atmosphere to garner max hindu voters in the same bid bima koregaon incident in pune has become bass of unfolding strategy of bjp against dalits and liberal class of indian society reportedly five persons liberals hr activists namely shoma sen ex head of english department of pune university gadling sidhir dalit poet mahesh raut and rona wilson committee of political

meeting in meerut on august 11 12 to chalk out strategy for the 2019 general election party chief amit shah also attended the crucial meeting along with top state leaders and other senior ministers

mega farmer rally in shahjahanpur on july 21 after minimum support price msp for at least 19 crops were raised by the government leaders have been directed to strengthen the party s reach in areas dominated by sp bsp and to reach out to maximum number of voters by highlighting achievements of both the central and the state government the western up district meerut has been chosen for the state executive because of a sizeable population of dalits backward classes and muslims there in this respect under the caption with eyes on 2019 bjp is shifting to a new and sharper polarisation the bjp seems to be combining dalits muslims and left liberals as the new combined other ajay gudavarthy wrote in a blog published on june 25 2018 on the website the wire in com as we move closer to the next

the terror attack in the indian occupied kashmir iok at a military base in uri close to the line of control loc with pakistan after the episode without any investigation india s top civil and military officials including their media started propaganda against pakistan it army and isi by accusing that the militants who targeted the uri base came from pakistan s side of azad kashmir by manipulating that false flag terror attack the bjp led indian prime minister modi had also accelerated war hysteria against pakistan and instructed indian forces to continue shelling across the loc and working boundary which have killed many innocent civilians inside pakistani side of kashmir and other nearby villages now in order win the elections of 2019 through double game indian forces are continuously violating the loc through intermittent shelling and have compelled pakistan army to give a matching response particularly indian media while highlighting false flag operations of the modi government will create a link of the arrested people with pakistan soon though allegations regarding pakistan affecting her elections are fanciful fabricated and baseless however following a well throughout plan bjp is playing anti muslim anti pakistan card to gain votes of a majority of hindus earlier bjp intended to create fissures in muslim voters by blowing up triple talaq irrevocable divorce issue aiming to get votes of muslim women but the move turned to be counterproductive resultantly bjp is focusing on hindu votes by creating a series of anti muslim and anti pakistan controversies as seen in jawher lal nehru university jnu new delhi and ali garh muslim university abdullah mustafvi alighar the same card would be played in jamiya miliya islamiya delhi and usmaniya university hyderabad in next few months where pakistan is also likely to be maligned the controversies of jnu and abdullah mustafvi were created to implicate islamabad through a well deliberated media campaign in the recent past journalists from pakistan and indian occupied kashmir were invited on the talk shows and efforts were made to mould their point of view continuing anti muslim and anti pakistan approach the pre election strategy of the bjp is also to create a rift among the leaders of kashmiris regarding pre election activities of the bjp an analyst remarked this needs to be taken up as an urgent campaign around the country a campaign that is inclusive of all whose hearts beat for the nation and one can not wait until the dates of the next elections are announced to start this campaign it is not hard to imagine that the electoral process and this campaign are intimately intertwined the bjp s hindutva hindu nationalism card is its chosen pathway to electoral victory undoubtedly we may conclude that

india s water warfare against pakistan,on august 7 this year under the caption pakistan fears india getting ready for water warfare through dams indian tv channel zee news though pointed out pakistan s apprehensions but admitted that india has initiated water warfare against pakistan in its news zee news criticized a statement of the then caretaker pakistani minister for water resources ali zafar where he suspected that there could be indian hand behind construction of kalabagh dam opposition for kalabagh dam kbd is from the political pundits in pakistan who have a known attachment with india he has also skammed india s kishanganga project yet again whether kalabagh dam construction commences in near future or not the fact on ground that is pinching india is that pakistan has finally decided to construct diamer bhasha dam which is likely to commence very soon several dam projects in india have been pakistan fear india getting ready for water warfare through dams speaking to members of the press ali zafar then pointed an accusatory finger at india and said that several dam projects across the border have been in violation of water treaties signed in the past the kishanganga hydropower project was in for specific criticism the kishanganga project was inaugurated by pm narendra modi on may 19 islamabad now possibly fears that this and other dam projects could help india bleed pakistan dry india has managed to build about 400 damns after the indus water treaty while pakistan has not even managed to build the kbd it kbd is very important it is life and it should be built as a priority in fact while heading a four judge bench hearing regarding diamer bhasha and mohmand dams case and taking note of the water scarcity in pakistan including its implications the chief justice of the supreme court of pakistan mian saqib said on july 30 2018 that construction of dams in the country is the responsibility of the elected government and the judiciary is just assisting it in this matter the decision to collect funds for the construction of such projects is not controversial and the government can take over the responsibility if it so wishes we will ensure that public money collected for the construction of dams should not be misused referring to the kalabagh dam justice nisar said consensus would be left to the public and their elected representatives the government established the diamer bhasha and mohmand dam fund after the supreme court issued directives on july 4 2018 that construction of the two dams should start immediately and appealed to the people including overseas pakistanis to make a contribution for executing the projects it is notable that from the very beginning india had initiated water warfare against pakistan since its inception india has never missed an opportunity to victimise pakistan by creating deliberate water scarcity with the aim to damage the latter agriculturally last year indian extremist prime minister narendra modi had given the concerned departments to continue construction of dams and ordered diverting water of chenab river to beas which is a serious violation of the indus water treaty iwt of 1960 therefore pakistan india water dispute has been deepened in this regard a high powered pakistani delegation led by pakistan s attorney general ashtar ausaf ali met with world bank chief executive officer kristalina georgieva and other senior officials in washington on may 21 22 2018 for resolution of disputes on kishanganga hydro electric power khep and rampur hydro electric power rhep world bank s senior vice president and group general counsel has forwarded a letter to ashtar ausaf ali the letter contains a summary of ideas to resolve the stalemate and proffers two proposals for which concerned authorities mowr agp will shortly convene a meeting to finalize pakistan s proposals proposal 1 pakistan accepts indian request to appoint neutral expert ne and proposal 2 india accepts pakistan s request for emplacement of court of arbitration coa the world bank is working with pakistan and india to resolve pakistan india disputes on kishanganga hydro electric power khep and rampur hydro electric power rhep in light of the provisions of the indus water treaty iwt a statement of the world bank said the delegation of the government of pakistan also shared with the bank their concerns about the recent inauguration of the kishanganga hydroelectric plant and the world bank assured that it will address islamabad s concerns regarding indian violations of the iwt but quite contrary to the above it has been observed that a deliberate and sustained dis information campaign has been launched on both print and electronic media of india that pakistan has lost its case of water dispute at international forum i e world bank it is noteworthy that in the recent past prime minister modi had inaugurated the 330mw kishanganga hydroelectric project in jammu and kashmir islamabad had protested the inauguration claiming that the project on a river flowing into pakistan will disrupt water supplies it is mentionable that pakistan is a grave victim of water scarcity because of being on lower riparian in relation to the rivers emanating from the indian held kashmir ihk new delhi is creating deliberate water shortages for pakistan with the aim to impair pakistan agriculturally historically india has been trying to establish her hegemony in the region by controlling water sources and damaging agricultural economies of her neighbouring states india has water disputes with pakistan nepal and bangladesh under the extremist government of prime minister modi pakistan has become specially target as india s water terrorism continues unabated in this respect in an article zofeen t ebrahim joydeep gupta co authors under the caption india resists world bank move to resolve indus water treaty dispute published in the third pole and reproduced updated by a pakistan s renowned daily on january 6 2017 is notable zofeen t ebrahim and joydeep gupta wrote india has asked the world bank not to rush in to resolve a dispute with pakistan over the kishanganga and ratle hydropower projects indian officials told a world bank representative in new delhi on january 5 that any differences over the projects can be resolved bilaterally or through a neutral expert pakistan has objected to the projects being built by india in jammu and kashmir on the grounds that they violate the 1960 indus waters treaty iwt between the two countries after india rejected the charge pakistan has gone to the world bank the designated iwt mediator islamabad has also asked the united states us government to intervene and has added the component of water security to the china pakistan economic corridor cpec agreement the kishanganga project is on a tributary of the jhelum while the ratle project is on the chenab as the dispute flared up the world bank had recently suspended all proceedings the setting up of a court of arbitration or the appointment of a neutral expert on january 5 world bank representative ian h solomon met officials of india s external affairs and water resources ministries in new delhi in an effort to break the deadlock the indian delegation led by gopal baglay joint secretary in the ministry of external affairs made a detailed a presentation on the two projects to support their argument that neither project violated the iwt after the meeting a government official told journalists that the indian side had described the objections raised by pakistan as technical and therefore they would be best resolved by a neutral expert pakistan has dismissed this suggestion earlier and is seeking a full court of arbitration the world bank had agreed to a court of arbitration and then to the appointment of a neutral expert leading to objections by both countries that was when both processes were suspended explore world bank pauses dam arbitration to protect indus waters treaty at the january 5 meeting solomon did not raise any question on the designs of the two projects according to the press trust of india news agency instead he explored ways to resolve the dispute with nothing decided the world bank official is going from new delhi to islamabad to continue this effort under the iwt india is allowed only non consumptive use of water from the three western rivers in the indus basin indus jhelum and chenab the recent stance by india where it lobbied aggressively and influenced the world bank he feared had further undermined the already fragile treaty the wb needs to take the right action which is to act as arbitrator in this matter as it has done before pointed out water expert simi kamal the bank needs to maintain this role and not back off now when its arbitration role is most required in the face of a belligerent indian government however new delhi s construction of several dams and new plans for more dams in the indian occupied kashmir is part of its most dangerous scheme of water warfare being waged against islamabad in order to further harm all political economic financial and social spheres of pakistan in this connection in march 2011 speaking in diplomatic language indus water commissioner of india g ranganathan denied that india s decision to build dams on rivers led to water shortage in pakistan he also rejected islamabad s concerns at water theft by new delhi or violation of the indus water treaty of 1960 assuring his counterpart syed jamaat ali shah that all issues relating to water would be resolved through dialogue however ground realties are quite different from what ranganathan maintained besides other permanent issues and especially the dispute of kashmir which has always been used by india to malign and pressurize pakistan water of rivers has become a matter of life and death for every pakistani as new delhi has been employing it as a tool of terrorism to blackmail pakistan,Fake
assamese muslims are being denied indian citizenship,under the mask of democracy and secularism indian subsequent regimes dominated by politicians from the hindi heartland hindutva hindu nationalism have been using brutal tactics mercilessly in suppressing the insurgencies and separatist movements in various regions and provinces such as kashmir punjab assam arunachal pradesh meghalaya manipur mizoram nagaland tripura etc including maoists naxalite these movements are the result of political social economic and religious justices which have been accelerated by the bjp led extremist government of prime minister narendra modi whose party won the elections in 2014 on the basis of anti muslim slogans besides assaults on the muslims in various parts of india bjp led alliance of the extremist parties have been targeting the 4 million assamese muslims who are being denied indian citizenship under national register of citizens nrc introduced by the bjp government as they are dubbed as bangladeshi speaking muslims as per adopted strategy bjp is pushing nrc as an use of national security and crucial solution to the problem of unemployment in this regard under the caption 40 lakh people excluded from citizen s register in assam thousands of bengali speaking muslims fear deportation huffington post wrote on july 30 2018 india said on monday july 30 2018 it had excluded more than four million people from a draft national register of citizens nrc in assam who could not produce valid documents a move that has sparked fears about the future of thousands in the region security has been tightened across the state which borders bangladesh as thousands of bengali speaking muslims worry about being sent to detention centres or deported the tea rich state of assam has long been the centre of social and communal tensions with locals campaigning against illegal immigrants a fight that prime minister narendra modi s hindu nationalist led government has championed in 1983 scores of people were chased down and killed by machete armed critics see the citizenship test as another measure supported by modi s bharatiya janata party bjp aimed at minority muslims if the government has decided to brand us foreigners what can we do said abdul suban 60 a bengali speaking muslim earlier the nrc is trying to finish us off our people have died here but we will not leave this place under the title assam register four million risk losing indian citizenship bbc said on july 30 this year india has published a list which effectively strips about four million people in the north eastern state of assam of their citizenship the national register of citizens nrc is a list of people who can prove they came to the state by 24 march 1971 a day before neighbouring bangladesh declared independence india says the process is needed to identify illegal bangladeshi migrants but it has sparked fears of a witch hunt against assam s ethnic minorities more than 32 million people submitted documents to the nrc to prove they were citizens but four million of them have been excluded from the published list many bengalis a linguistic minority in assam are worried they will be deported en masse hasitun nissa who spoke to the bbc s joe miller said it is where the 47 year old schoolteacher spent her childhood where she studied where she got married and where she had her four children she said her family arrived in india before 1971 but she expected to be stripped of her indian citizenship and feared her land rights voting rights and freedom would be in peril activists say the nrc is now being used as a pretext for a two pronged attack by hindu nationalists and assamese hardliners on the state s bengali community a large portion of whom are muslims like hasitun many bengalis live in the wetlands dotted along the bramaputra river moving around when water levels rise bengali campaigner nazrul ali ahmed is adamant that the nrc is nothing but a conspiracy to commit atrocities he told the bbc they are openly threatening to get rid of muslims and what happened to the rohingya in myanmar could happen to us here the latest move to make millions of people stateless overnight has sparked fears of violence in what is already a tinderbox state narendra modi s hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party bjp which rules the state has insisted in the past that illegal muslim immigrants will be deported but neighbouring bangladesh will definitely not accede to such a request chances are india will end up creating the newest cohort of stateless people raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo the rohingya people who fled myanmar for bangladesh no deportation procedures have been put in place and bangladesh already burdened by the rohingya crisis has shown no sign of being open to accepting a raft of new refugees however many muslims of assam bloggers and writers have been highlighting the issue through media various websites including social media before the international community and the muslim world over the issue as assam muslims are being denied of their basic right of citizenship according to them the updated national register of citizens nrc list is a move to target assam s muslim population on the pretext of weeding out bangladeshi migrants in karimganj a district bordering bangladesh 91 53 made it through in the final nrc draft this is a marked increase compared to the first draft when 38 were included of the 13 24 096 applicants 12 11 997 have been included in the final nrc draft there are so many people there in the jail including women please consider this case on humanitarian grounds does central government have any rehabilitation package for them divide and rule policy will finish the country this government will never spoke to us bengal and bangladesh assam people are helpless and can not connect with us also this is not only bengali speaking people of course there are so many biharis will they not protest if they are tortured i can not contact bangladesh as it is an external affairs situation and is not my matter but i will raise the issue which bangladesh will also oppose this is a wrong decision and will affect the entire country all caste creed and community if i get the opportunity i will meet home minister rajnath singh says mamata banerjee on nrc assam issue situation in assam is fragile and human rights and democratic rights of the people of the state are at stake jaiprakash narayan yadav sp said the move would lead to hatred and violence in assam and dubbed it as a war on people who are living in the state for the last 40 years in this respect in a well known website rediff com nibir deka wrote on august 14 2018 the story got another twist the districts where bengali was spoken witnessed a surge in muslim population while leaders of the assam movement saw their struggle as linguistic where many muslims also died for the cause the official martyrs list of the assam agitation as published in assamaccord assam gov in cites the names of various muslim leaders who had died during the struggle emphasis on the religious element of the problem came to the fore when the bjp brought the citizenship amendment bill 2016 which envisaged giving citizenship to non muslim refugees who sought a safe haven in india from religious persecution in their countries the bill was opposed by all assam agitation leaders barring the bjp according to a notification of the ministry of home affairs in march this year there is no specific treaty or agreement with the government of bangladesh regarding repatriation of its citizens who had entered india illegally this puts a question mark on the future of the people who will be declared illegal after the nrc finishes its work as they are in all likelihood going to be bengali speaking muslims mamata banerjee is the one who is most alarmed because it is to west bengal that they will shift but she also sees a political opportunity in playing minority politics the bjp can also see a bigger project of using the citizenship issue to extend it from a nationalities issue to a patriotism issue it is notable that the issue of the muslims of assam reminds bangladeshi muslims of indian highhandedness and it could create a wedge between bangladesh and india nevertheless the leaders of the western countries their media and human rights groups must take notice of the plight of assam s muslims who are being targeting by the fundamentalist regime of the bjp and are being denied of their basic right of the indian

question of indian nuclear security,indian media reported on july 5 this year that the kolkata police have arrested five men with 1 kg of uranium valued at around rs 3 crores 440 000 the times of india elaborated that the men had come to kolkata in the state of west bengal to try to sell the substance police were quoted as saying that two packets of a yellow coloured substance were seized however it is not the new event as the same also took place in india in the past it is notable that when the us former president barack obama hosted the fourth nuclear security summit in washington on march 31 2016 to check the spread of nuclear weapons showing concerns about the ambitions of terrorist groups such as the isis in acquiring a nuclear weapon or radioactive material the us president donald trump had taken a different stand in his interview with the cnn by stating more nuclear weapons could make the world safer us can no longer afford to bankroll the defense of its allies in europe asia and the middle east japan south korea and saudi arabia may need arsenals to confront threats in their region on their own similarly by following the double standards of america and some western countries in its worst form president trump also favoured india while opposing the nuclear weapons of pakistan because being the only nuclear country in the islamic world pakistan annoys the us israel and some western countries as a matter of fact it is zionist agenda to denculearise pakistan however like obama trump has brushed aside the ground realities that indian prime minister narendra modi led by the ruling fundamentalist party bjp has been implementing anti muslim and anti pakistan agenda as part of their double game these us led countries have ignored indian poor record of nuclear security non proliferation lack of safety of workers working at indian nuclear facilities and lack of any appropriate regulatory authority indian past record proves various kinds of security and safety lapses regarding various nuclear plants and the related sensitive materials events of leakage nuclear theft smuggling and killing in this regard in november 2009 more than 90 indian workers suffered radiation due to contamination of drinking water at the kaiga atomic power station in karnataka on july 27 1991 a similar event occurred at the heavy water plant run by the department of atomic energy at rawatbhata in rajasthan nuclear radiation had affected and injured many laborers there in july 1998 india s central bureau of investigation cbi seized eight kg of nuclear material from three engineers in chennai which was stolen from an atomic research center on november 7 2000 international atomic energy agency iaea disclosed that indian police had seized 57 pounds of uranium and arrested two men for illicit trafficking of radioactive material iaea had revealed that indian civil nuclear facilities were vulnerable to thefts on january 26 2003 cnn pointed out that indian company nec engineers private ltd shipped 10 consignments to iraq containing highly sensitive equipments entailing titanium vessels and centrifugal pumps in december 2006 a container packed with radioactive material had been stolen from an indian fortified research atomic facility near mumbai in june 2009 india s nuclear scientist lokanathan mahalingam missed from the scenario and after a couple of days his dead body was recovered from the kali river indian police concocted a story that mahalingam had committed suicide by jumping into the river it is a big joke to hide some real facts behind his death because wisdom proves that if an educated person decides to commit suicide he will definitely adopt a soft way to eliminate his life afterwards dr haleema saadia said that death of the scientist was a conspiracy nevertheless such events in connection with nuclear materials continued unabated in india putting the security of atomic weapons and their related components including the lives of workers at high risk it is mentionable that during his first visit to new delhi on november 6 2010 president obama announced the measures america would take regarding removal of indian space and defence companies from a restricted entities list and supported indian demand membership of four key global nuclear nonproliferation regimes and as part of the double standards in relation to india and pakistan america set aside the indian poor record regarding the safety of nuclear weapons and related materials despite indian violations of various international agreements and its refusal to sign non proliferation treaty npt comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt and additional protocol with the iaea washington signed a pact of nuclear civil technology with new delhi in 2008 during american president barack obama s visit to india on january 25 2016 the us and india announced a breakthrough on the pact which would allow american companies to supply new delhi with civilian nuclear technology notably america is a potential military supplier to india us also pressurized iaea and the nuclear suppliers group nsg to grant a waiver to new delhi for obtaining civil nuclear trade on larger scale evidences indicate that india has not fulfilled the conditions of the nsg waiver at least eight of india s nuclear reactors are outside safeguards which are a big question mark on the credibility of its nuclear safety and security standards two reports from the king s college respectively titled india s nuclear exceptionalism and india s strategic nuclear and missile program also claim that india has already accumulated nuclear material for over 2600 nuclear weapons including all of its unsafeguarded reactor grade plutonium which is weapon usable and raised concerns over this stockpiling in fact in the pretext of countering china washington has continued favouring india s programme of advancement and modernization of nuclear weapons us supports india s atomic programme in the pretext of anti china and anti pakistan approach beijing is apprehensive about the emerging threat as during the last visit of obama to new delhi the intent of president obama and indian prime minister modi was quite clear while mentioning about free sea lanes and air passages in the south china sea president trump is also pursuing the policy of his predecessor in this respect as in the recent past during his meeting with prime minister modi he showed similar approach nevertheless arms deals with america which also include nuclear submarines to new delhi would increase indian hegemonic designs in the region and nsg s membership of india will create concerns for regional strategic stability which is part of american global interests besides obtaining atomic weapons from the us and other western countries new delhi is clandestinely importing nuclear arms components and submarines from tel aviv in this connection zionist led indo israeli secret diplomacy could be assessed from the interview of israel s ambassador to india mark sofer published in the indian weekly outlook on february 18 2008 regarding india s defense arrangements with tel aviv sofer had surprisingly revealed we do have a defense relationship with india and with all due respect the secret part will remain a secret although these atomic weapons seem to be mysterious yet still could be within the reach of some hindu terrorists with the help of indian intelligence agency raw which might have also got these destructive arms from israeli secret agency mossad such atomic weapons or radiological materials could have also been smuggled inside india by the hindu fundamentalists with the covert assistance of raw frustrated in isolating islamabad raw in connivance with mossad might have prepared a most dangerous plan to use nuclear weapons or dirty nuclear bombs inside the us homeland or any major european country to implicate pakistan for having allegedly used these weapons through some taliban militants particularly raw and mossad may also employ these fatal weapons against nato forces in afghanistan as india and israel want to prolong the stay of the us led nato troops in afghanistan which have become the center of their covert activities against pakistan russia china and iran terrorists of the islamic state outfit also known as daesh isis and isil which are strategic assets of the cia may be used by raw and mossad for employment of these unconventional weapons while india israel and america are also playing double game against one another hence by utilizing the vicious circle of terrorism new delhi can alone use these weapons through afghanistan based tehreek e taliban pakistan ttp and isis which are also being backed by raw cia and mossad and have claimed responsibility for several terror assaults inside pakistan and afghanistan including the recent ones so raw s sole aim will be to provoke americans and its allies against islamabad which is challenging indian hegemony in the region thus indian raw could create a dangerous misunderstanding in which us could use small nuclear weapons against pakistan or could ask the latter of rollback its atomic programme returning to our main discussion question of indian nuclear security is frightening the entire world therefore by abandoning their double standards the us led western countries must take serious notice of indian proliferation of nuclear weapons and its poor nuclear security world s various forums such as eu and uno including russia should also take cognizance of new delhi in this regard,Fake
an open letter to mr amitabh bachchan and mr aamir khan,dear mr amitabh bachchan and mr aamir khan as an indian i feel absolutely elated that indian film superstars such as yourselves not only enjoy the adulation and demigod status with a humongous fan following in our country but also across a country like china which seems so alien to our culture and ethos but it just proves that talent can transcend all borders and language does not pose any kind of barrier it is but natural with your popularity growing exponentially across the globe the large corporate and marketing gurus see great potential in investing in you as brand ambassadors so that your charisma and popularity can rub off on their brands and boost the sales of their products i would like to bring to your attention certain facts behind chinese products which celebrities endorse a word of caution you will find the facts revolting did you know china s economic power is the result of sending innocent people who have committed no crimes but do not follow the party s ideologies to forced labour camps to serve as a large scale force of free slave labour it is estimated that more than one crore people work in thousands of forced labour camps across china this includes a big majority of political prisoners china tops the world with more than 2 300 executions per year remember every time you buy a product made in china you are funding and empowering a brutal regime a lot of chinese goods available in the indian market are made by prisoners under appalling conditions in what the chinese call laogai or labour camps they are deprived of sleep and have to slog away without food or breaks with their hands bleeding the shocker is that they are killed on demand for their organs that are matched and sold to the highest bidder it is a billion dollar industry supported by the state government the victims are mostly falun dafa practitioners who practice an exercise and meditation practice that promotes good health with an emphasis on improving one s moral character last year during diwali there was a public service campaign calling for boycotting chinese goods it is ironical that a popular chinese mobile phone maker sold a record one million smart phones in india in 18 days during the diwali festive season despite calls for boycott of chinese goods in the country we all know that in today s world since a mobile phone is an extension of oneself one is totally handicapped without a phone but ignoring the sordid details of what goes on behind the making of the made in china product would be as gandhiji said an evil system never deserves such allegiance allegiance to it means partaking of the evil a good person will resist an evil system with his or her soul 70 million people practicing falun dafa a peaceful spiritual practice with exercise and meditation became the soft target and are being killed on demand to supply an ongoing illegal organ transplant industry the chinese government ex chief jiang zemin not being able to come to terms with the popularity of falun dafa introduced by master li hongzhi in 1992 with 70 million chinese people practicing it banned it on 20 july 1999 since then for 18 years falun dafa practitioners are systematically imprisoned tortured and killed for their organs their bodies are often cremated so that there is no evidence left read more at www faluninfo net chinese doctors and hospital workers admitted in recorded phone calls from undercover investigators that they have live organs from healthy falun dafa practitioners in prisons available for sale when all over the world patients have to wait for years for organ transplants in china you can get it in a week s time hospital web sites in china till recently advertised short waiting times for organ transplants due to the increase of available organs for sale in china many foreigners travel there for transplantation 10 000 organs are transplanted in china every year even though china has no effective national organ donation system i would least like to put you in a dilemma where you can t renege on your contracts which would cast a slur on your professionalism and integrity and neither can the company summarily terminate the contract and suffer huge losses what i think could be a benevolent solution is for you to make amends by making more people aware of these crimes against humanity you can also at an opportune moment talk to the corporate decision makers or people who matter in the chinese government to put an end to the persecution please do not misconstrue this as getting political it is a moral issue a human rights issue i respect your integrity and your exemplary sense of ethics at the core of your being and it is demonstrated often when you have stood up for social causes and exposed many of society s ills laudable are amitabh bachchan s moral stance of not endorsing any product that has anything to do with alcohol or smoking and the public service campaign beti bachao beti padhao for the girl child and aamir khan s satyamev jayate proactive tv serial to expose corruption and social evils for your kind information falun dafa was introduced in india in the year 2000 it was officially registered in 2004 and since then the exercise and meditation practice has been introduced in schools and colleges across the length and breadth of india falun dafa was well received by the police academies in delhi and hyderabad falun dafa adherents were invited by several large organizations to introduce it to their senior executives and interestingly jail superintends too have requested to introduce the exercise and meditation practice to inmates it will be of special interest to you that in the mumbai film industry there are many behind the scene artistes such as hair stylists make up artists talent search agencies photographers who have found strength in falun dafa to overcome the stress of the glitz and glamour world thank you for your patience and i look forward to some positive action from you very truly yours suren rao president falun dafa association of india surenrao9 unseen is,Fake
line,shardi and nardi two mountain peaks two enslaved fairies are an integral part of the beautiful town of sharda centuries ago they lived in sharda peacefully and happily the place was known for knowledge and learning people travelled from across the mountains and valleys to satiate their thirst for knowledge in those ancient times arrived a man from the world laid distantly across the difficult banihal pass soon he was known for his meek appearance but clever mind he often lived in the world of incantation and magic it did not take long before the man was charmed by the beauty of shardi and nardi they were alien to him but he entrapped them to go along to his world after a short journey to the lands across the difficult passes both shardi and nardi found out the devilish mysterious habits of the man and ran back scared to their own land the man chased them chained them but they remained unmoved by his orders frustrated and angered the man cast a magic spell and turned them into objects of mud and stone he then returned back to his lands laid detached and distant much beyond in the deltas of ganges in the period of centuries much gathered over static and stationary shardi and nardi they had lost the power to converse with their kinsmen living in sharda village but retained the consciousness to converse with each other gradually both found out that they could converse with another mate neelum for people neelum was a riverine but in fact it was living specie that found out the methods of surviving forever neelum was usually quiet brooding over time and destiny but occasionally conversed with the two and assured them of the freedom days decades ago shardi and nardi came to know that their captor had reincarnated and crossed the difficult passes to take them to his remote lands however this time aware of his ill intent the people of the land had put a halt to his advances a war broke out and warlock was stopped but there he marked a line that divided the people of the land shardi and nardi are waiting for centuries now for their captor to free them or for their kinsmen to rid them of their plight shardi and nardi believe in their cause of freedom as the captor for sure is to return to his land neelum looked amused that morning now it was a routine to find scores of travellers around sharda and other villages nearby neelum knew them well as most were kinsmen of mai kolachi neelum found himself chained in love with mai kolachi in centuries old times once neelum started his journey from the land of high mountains in search of eternity he found out a natural course all along till he met mai kolachi there he found eternity in the vast bosom of seashores and deep waters neelum found out that people all around were as amiable as mai kolachi though neelum kept his abode in high mountains but got accustomed to habits care and love of the land that led him to mai kolachi on one beautiful morning neelum found a beautiful girl and a young boy brooding over his wings the girl was a painter and the boy was a poet they have found out the power of love in a way that not only connected them profusely to each other but they could also converse with nature the girl soon spotted shardi and nardi and started painting them the boy got engaged in conversation with neelum he asked him the meaning of love the question stirred the usually quiet neelum and he replied love is a dream that is chased by all and forever most often it is taken as an object that can be kept in one shape but in that fallacy lies the death of love then neelum almost talked to himself i have lived in time and found out that love never survives in ordinary sense one can not live forever in once charming but motionless circles love is a power that frees you from all chains of acceptance and non acceptance it is a state of soul where meanings of union and separation are no different love is almost like a relation of a ship and a sea the ship has no life being stationary and outside the waters but still it travels all over the sea waters never stop the ship at one point but widens its lanes and open the arms once ship choses to stay or travel the waters know that the ship is always in their world and would never go away the boy looked at the girl who was painting and she nodded affirmatively the poet who was always in search of truth and beauty had found the answer of love in freedom and continuity it appeared that he had slipped but in reality he chose to enter the waters of neelum silently neelum then turned to the girl and said love is not always staying together love is not always union for nothing is permanent in this world of change and uncertainty pain and pleasure both are love if faith is kept on freedom of choice betrayal or broken promises should never be mistaken for love as oneness of souls needs no promises to be kept neelum was happy to find a new companion too they both would travel to the land of mai kolachi neelum then asked the girl to give title to her painting power of abstinence silence humility and patience are strands of abstinence that frees the man from the mysteries of want the girl stayed sombre and completed her painting neelum had taught her that continuity was life neelum and the poet started travelling and natural flow of the river was taking them to mai kolachi the boy was sure that he would meet the girl there miles below sharda village neelum and the boy reached the village keran there neelum shared the story of the divided village and a drowned girl who chose honour over ruin centuries after the time had repeated the story of agony and sufferings and this time not one man of incantation but a multitude of his kinsmen invaded the land of shardi and nardi they were yelling mantras of peace but were dragging all of them to the lands they never belonged to the winds rivers mountains springs suns and moons all travelled along neelum to the lands of mai kolachi neelum stood their way to protect the people of keran but there they established a line of control on the bosom of neelum and divided the people then began the story of ordeal for many shardi and nardi in the land that was often alluded as paradise on that fateful day the kinsmen of the incantation man came to the village in search of men of freedom who wanted to unite the divided village of keran these alien men were brutal in their methods and manners there they found this beautiful poor girl who was no less than a fairy they dragged her to their abode and the night of evil spread her wings the girl looked across neelum where laid the other part of village keran that was serene and peaceful as a child in the lap of a mother the girl was engrossed in deep thoughts among the invaders she was thinking of his people living across neelum they lived and moved freely like their ancestors to the lands of mai kolachi their destination was not an imposed one rather a chosen one they all knew love which freed them from burdens of unwanted obligations they also knew the meaning of life which was a continuity from times immemorial both their life and love always took them along the course of neelum whose final abode along his brothers jhelum and chenab was the land of mai kolachi they all were freed by power of love and had faith in their common destiny the girl then made a final decision and quietly escaped from her captors this time the captors could not stop her by their magical incantations the girl knew that she could not swim yet she chose to cross neelum on an evil night neelum took the girl in his warm motherly arms to end her ordeal of pangs and sufferings the painter girl was going back to her home in the lands of mai kolachi the boy and neelum were travelling parallel in the same downward direction the poor girl of divided keran village was already in the lands of natural contiguity and instinctive affinity no other line exists in those lands but only one line of continuity that unites mai kolachi to the beautiful village of sharda shardi and nardi are waiting for their kinsmen to free them or the time to end the magic spell of their alien

pakistan day on july 19 this year on this very day in 1947 the historical resolution was adopted by the by the all jammu and kashmir muslim conference in abi guzar srinagar during an emergency convention at the residence of sardar muhammad ibrahim khan it was presided over by chaudhry hamid ullah khan and the resolution was presented by khawaja ghulam ud din wani and abdul rahim wani with 59 prominent leaders in attendance the resolution was unanimously adopted 19 1947 showing a political and constitutional stance it indicated that existing religious geographical cultural economic ties and the aspirations of millions of kashmiri muslims warrant accession of the state of jammu and kashmir j k with pakistan during the partition of the sub continent the people of the state of jammu and kashmir which comprised muslim majority decided to join pakistan according to the british led formula but dogra raja sir hari singh a hindu who was ruling over the j k in connivance with the indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru and governor general lord mountbatten joined india the design to forcibly wrest kashmir began to unfold on august 16 1947 with the announcement of the radcliffe boundary award it gave the gurdaspur district a majority muslim area to india to provide a land route to the indian armed forces to move into kashmir there was a rebellion in the state forces which revolted against the maharaja and were joined by pathan tribesmen lord mountbatten ordered armed forces to land in srinagar however indian forces invaded srinagar on 27 october 1947 and forcibly occupied jammu and kashmir in utter violation of the partition plan and against the wishes of the kashmiri people when pakistan responded militarily against the indian aggression on december 31 1947 india made an appeal to the un security council to intervene and a ceasefire ultimately came into effect on january 01 1949 following un resolutions calling for a plebiscite in kashmir it is mentionable that the security council adopted resolution 47 1948 of 21 april 1948 which promised a plebiscite under un auspices to enable the people of jammu and kashmir to determine whether they wish to join pakistan or india on february 5 1964 india backed out of its promise of holding plebiscite instead in march 1965 the indian parliament passed a bill declaring kashmir a province of india an integral part of the indian union the very tragedy of kashmiris had started after 1947 when they were denied their genuine right of self determination they organised themselves against the injustices of india and launched a war of liberation which new delhi tried to suppress through various forms of state terrorism it is notable that since 1947 in order to maintain its illegal control india has continued its repressive regime in the occupied kashmir through various machinations such as establishment of puppet governments etc ironically despite a lapse of 67 years kashmiris are still struggling and sacrificing to achieve their alienable right under the un resolutions kashmir valley is one of the most heavily militarized regions in the world with indian 7 million armed security forces which are perpetrating various forms of state terrorism on the innocent kashmiris since 1989 a deliberate campaign by the indian army and paramilitary forces against the kashmiris has been manifested in brutal tactics such as crackdowns curfews illegal detentions massacre targeted killings sieges burning the houses torture disappearances rape breaking the legs molestation of muslim women and killing of persons through fake encounters according to a report on human rights violations in the indian occupied kashmir since 1989 there have been deaths of 1 00000 innocent kashmiris 7 023 custodial killings 1 22 771 arrests 1 05 996 destruction of houses or buildings 22 776 women widowed 1 07 466 children orphaned and 10 086 women gang raped molested indian brutal securities forces have continue these atrocities besides human rights watch in its various reports amnesty international has also pointed out grave human rights violations in the indian controlled kashmir indicating the muslim majority population in the kashmir valley suffers from the repressive tactics of the security forces under the jammu and kashmir disturbed areas act and the armed forces jammu and kashmir

extrajudicial killings of the innocent persons at the hands of indian security forces in the indian held kashmir the report points out tens of thousands of security forces are deployed in indian administered kashmir the armed forces special powers act afspa allows troops to shoot to kill suspected militants or arrest them without a warrant not a single member of the armed forces has been tried in a civilian court for violating human rights in kashmir this lack of accountability has in turn facilitated other serious abuses india has martyred one 100 000 people more than 8 000

kashmir particularly in 2008 a rights group reported unnamed graves in various regions of the indian occupied kashmir in this connection in august 2011 indian jammu and kashmir state human rights commission shrc officially acknowledged in its report that innocent civilians killed in the two decade conflict have been buried in unmarked graves notably foreign sources and human rights organizations including association of parents of disappeared persons apdp have disclosed that unnamed graves include thousands of persons killed by the indian forces in the fake encounters including

usually bullet ridden mutilated faces disfigured and sometimes without limbs and heads it seems that non condemnation of these indian massive human rights violations and non interference for the settlement of this issue by the so called civilized international community especially the us have further encouraged new delhi to keep on going with its state terrorism on the armless kashmiri masses ignorance of the issue by them involves the risk of nuclear war between pakistan and india indian authorities are not willing to talk with kashmiri people on political grounds new delhi reached to a conclusion that only bullet is the right way of dealing with kashmiris demanding their right of self determination surprisingly indian successive governments are trying to ignore the dynamics of the freedom movement of kashmiris for the sake of their alien rule it is noteworthy that dialogue between india and pakistan took place on a number of occasions but produced no outcome prolonging the agony of the subjugated people of the occupied kashmir due to indian intransigence it is worth mentioning that since the martyrdom of burhan wani commander of hizb ul mujahideen by the indian security forces on july 8 2017 new dehi has accelerated state terrorism throughout the indian controlled kashmir as a result more than 200 people embraced martyrdom and around 20 000 got injured many became permanently blind due to pellet guns shots curfew remained imposed for more than four months around 12 000 people were arrested or detained nevertheless every year the kashmiris and their brethren in pakistan and those living all over the world observe 19th july as the accession to pakistan day to re affirm their commitment to continue their struggle against indian illicit occupation and till the

kashmir martyrs day revisited,by sajjad shaukat every year kashmir martyrs day is commemorated on july 13 in the memory of 21 kashmiris who were martyred outside srinagar central jail by the troops of dogra maharaja on july 13 1931 this heinous incident took place on that day when people had gathered to witness the court proceedings against abdul qadeer who was charged for instigating kashmiris to defy dogra rule the very day is observed on both sides of the line of control and all over the world by the kashmiris to pay homage to these kashmiris the day is the milestone in the history as it has given a new impetus to the kashmir s struggle for independence in wake of indian state terrorism which has continued in the indian occupied kashmir and has converting every day into martyrs day for the kashmiris however the history of dogra rule 1846 1947 in kashmir is replete with tyrannous treatment meted out to the kashmiri muslims by dogra forces under the dogra rule they were leading so miserable life that it was difficult to differentiate them from beasts slave labour heavy taxes capital punishment for cow slaughter and living under constant terror was order of the day in this regard yousaf saraf in his book kashmiris fight for freedom calls it free forced labour and instead of donkeys and horses kashmiri muslims were used for transportation of goods across the far flung areas in this context while describing the pathetic picture of the kashmiris in his book the india we served sir walter lawrence writes army was employed in forcing the villagers to plough and sow and worse still the soldiers came at harvest time and when the share of the state had been seized and there was very little grain to tide the unfortunate peasants over the cruel winter on april 19 1931 the ban of eid khutba sermon ignited widespread demonstrations in the jummu city for a number of days it was followed by desecration of the holy quran at the hands of dogra forces which resulted into outrage among the muslims throughout the state in srinagar people gathered in jamia masjid to denounce this blasphemy one such get together was held in khankah e muella srinagar which was addressed by prominent kashmiris when the meeting was concluded a youth abdul qadeer pointing his finger to the maharaja s palace raised slogans destroy its every brick with the accusation of sedition he was arrested forthwith abdul qadir was to be tried in the court but due to large public resentment the court was shifted to central jail srinagar on july 12 1931 in response to the shifting of court intense public protests were held throughout the city the next day on july 13 1931 thousands of people thronged the central jail srinagar to witness the in camera trial of abdul qadeer as the time for obligatory prayer approached a young kashmiri stood for azan the dogra governor ray zada tartilok chand ordered soldiers to open fire at him when he got martyred another young man took his place and started azan he was also shot dead in this way 21 kashmiris embraced martyrdom in their efforts to complete the azan the people carried the dead and paraded through the streets of srinagar chanting slogans against dogra brutalities complete strike was observed in the city which was followed by weeklong mourning this incident shook the whole state and the traffic from srinagar to rawalpindi and srinagar to jammu came to halt from july 13 to 26 1931 the 21 martyrs are buried in martyrs graveyard at khawaja bazar srinagar consequently upon these brutal killings the kashmiri leadership realized the need to form a political party muslim conference mc with a view to waging struggle for their freedom later in 1934 state s first elections were held and mc won 10 out of 21 seats and after two years in 1936 it succeeded in getting 19 out of 21 seats indian congress was upset with this situation and tried to create division in the ranks of kashmiri leadership afterwards on july 19 1947 mc passed a resolution to merge kashmir with pakistan considering the geographical proximity majority of muslim population 77 language and cultural relations of jammu and kashmir ironically despite a lapse of 66 years kashmiris are still struggling and sacrificing to achieve their alienable right under the un resolutions for the plebiscite in jammu and kashmir kashmir valley is one of the most

wall street journal gab to rein in calls for violence while allowing hate speech,this is the same wall street journal journalist who went after killstream the social media site where the alleged pittsburgh synagogue shooter broadcast his intentions is pledging to curb threats of violence while it said it plans to remain a platform where hate speech and other forms of extreme content are permitted gab com which resumed service this week after a stretch in digital exile will proactively police the site rather than wait for users to report troubling posts founder andrew torba said in an interview vowing to bolster efforts to expunge threats of physical harm since monday gab has permanently banned 200 accounts for repeatedly violating its guidelines around threats of violence mr torba said gab prohibits calling for acts of violence against others as well as threatening language that clearly directly and incontrovertibly infringes on the safety of another user it also removed more than 1 000 posts that threatened violence and hadn t been reported by users he said the banned users weren t notified but he is working to add more transparency to the process the big takeaway is confirmation of 200 permanent bans find out more 56 507 before the pittsburgh shooting there were two high profile bans on gab of weev and paul nehlen since pittsburgh there have been 200 permanent bans since monday presumably even more users were permanently banned during the downtime last week because lots of accounts were already noticeably missing when gab came back online last weekend for the record i have no objection to the no promotion of violence but hate speech is fine standard that s the same standard which i have adopted here at occidental dissent i m not running a free speech website though this is my own personal nationalist blog from what i saw on gab it isn t clear that everyone who was purged was even posting violent speech i could be wrong on this point but it caught my eye that accounts which i had never considered edge posters were purged so what to do journalists and antifa have now signed up accounts on gab for the sole purpose of reporting posts to nuke accounts these bans have already had a chilling effect on gab they have cancelled out the major advantage that gab had over twitter and facebook which was that users could network and post there without having to deal with those people abusing the moderation system if we have to deal with them on gab why not just deal with them on facebook and twitter in some form we re going to be returning to facebook and twitter now i m not exactly sure how to do this at the moment i plan to figure it out over the weekend though,Fake

president trump blocks caravans from requesting asylum with executive order,as promised the trump administration has released the executive order to deal with the caravans washington the trump administration invoking national security powers meant to protect the united states against threats from abroad announced new rules on thursday that give president trump vast authority to deny asylum to virtually any migrant who crosses the border illegally administration officials declined to say who will be affected by the new rules but it is widely expected inside the government and by advocate groups that mr trump intends to deny asylum to migrants from central american nations some of whom are marching toward the united states in a widely publicized caravan in theory the executive order will force illegal aliens seeking asylum to come in through a port of entry like san ysidro where the last well publicized caravan crossed the border this is undoubtedly about to get litigated by the aclu and lawyers from a bunch of different groups in the federal courts president trump isn t wrong about our terrible immigration laws which limit what he can do here it is up to congress to change those laws but the republican majority in congress didn t want to do so mitch mcconnell has refused to change the filibuster which has killed off any chances of passing controversial legislation in the senate without attaining a nearly impossible hurdle of 60 votes find out more 57 321 the caravans will likely cross the border at a port of entry request asylum and be housed in the tent cities that trump was talking about at his recent press conference whether they will stay there or be released like the others after some federal court decision remains to be seen npi has grown tired of this and wants to move on the likelihood that trump will accomplish anything meaningful during the remainder of his term is low the likelihood that the gop can be made over into a party that does the right thing for its white base is lower the likelihood that trump will lose in 2020 is substantial evan mclaren evanmclaren november 8 2018 many perhaps most recognized members of the alt right brain trust decline to acknowledge this and instead prefer to continue boosting trump while constructing increasingly remote white pill explanations for how he will rally and how we will ultimately triumph through him evan mclaren evanmclaren november 8 2018 it is difficult to overstate the precariousness of the present situation for whites european civilization stands on a precipice moralizing and restoring the positive heroic consciousness of white peoples is vital all our effort must be directed towards this evan mclaren evanmclaren november 8 2018 we lack spare energy for trump s circus and the gop wasteland we have our own networks to form institutions to build projects to advance continuing simply to amplify trump s signal is reckless at best the empty chant that he and we are both nationalists changes nothing evan mclaren evanmclaren november 8 2018 they re not wrong about how we are spending our own time it makes little sense to follow every little move of the trump administration and remain on the edge of our seats the chances of anything substantial getting done are slim to none at this point,Fake

wow two major changes in the wh special report jeff sessions resigns as attorney general new person overseeing the russia investigation video,following the receipt of a resignation letter from attorney general jeff sessions president trump has announced that matthew g whitaker chief of staff to sessions at the department of justice will become our new acting attorney general of the united states special report jeff sessions resigns as attorney general nbc news jeff sessions out as attorney general after steady drumbeat of criticism from trump jeff sessions the president s earliest and most fervent supporter in congress stepped down as attorney general wednesday after brutal criticism from the president bringing an abrupt end to his controversial tenure as the nation s top law enforcement officer president trump wrote on twitter after a marathon press conference at the white house that sessions was out and that sessions chief of staff matthew whitaker would serve as an acting replacement emigrate while you still can learn more sessions 71 lasted not quite two years in the job but in that brief period the former alabama senator managed to usher in a new era at the justice department sen jeff sessions loyal to trump defined by race and immigration sessions threatened so called sanctuary cities with the loss of federal funding and announced a zero tolerance policy for people who cross the southern u s border illegally he decried a looming wave of violent crime across the country even though criminologists maintain murders and assaults remain near historic lows in most places in his first year as attorney general sessions transforms justice in key ways he ordered federal prosecutors to seek the most serious charges and stiff prison sentences against drug criminals a stark reversal of former president barack obama s most prominent and bipartisan justice policy he presided over a rollback in investigations of local police he rescinded policies that directed federal prosecutors to go after only the biggest cases involving marijuana in states where the drug is legal and he recommitted to using private prisons for u s inmates and detainees whos the real jeff sessions two hearings in 1986 show a conflicting picture a long fuse the seeds of sessions departure were planted ironically during his confirmation hearing sessions went out of his way to deny meeting with russians in the course of the 2016 presidential campaign his former colleagues in the senate approved the nomination 52 to 47 despite concerns about allegations of racial insensitivity and hostility to civil rights in his past but sessions soon ran into trouble he was forced to correct his senate testimony to indicate he had in fact met with the russian ambassador at least twice in 2016 democrats on capitol hill accused him of making false statements the disclosure provoked intense public scrutiny of his actions u s intercepts reportedly contradict attorney general on russia contacts by march of 2017 sessions fielded questions almost daily about whether he could oversee the ongoing department of justice investigation into russian interference in the election given his vocal role in the campaign in which he even donned a make america great again hat to support donald trump ultimately after consulting with doj ethics officials sessions recused himself from the russia probe he cited longstanding rules regarding conflicts that arise when authorities investigate campaigns in which they participate the recusal decision was hailed by democrats and good government groups the president had a different reaction two sources familiar with the situation have told npr president trump raged sometimes profanely in phone and face to face conversations with sessions it didn t take long for trump to voice open regret on social media an in interviews about having nominated sessions the president grew even more antagonistic when sessions deputy rod rosenstein appointed a special counsel to lead the russia investigation after trump fired fbi director james comey trump called the doj russia probe a witch hunt and cast aspersions on its leader former fbi director robert mueller a registered republican trump s allies produced an ad attacking mueller s team for donating to democratic political campaigns all the while sessions ducked questions on the matter given his recusal but as mueller hired more than two dozen staff members and prosecutors with experience in corporate fraud money laundering organized crime and executive privilege trump exploded he denigrated sessions rosenstein mueller and the entire post watergate practice of law enforcement independence from the white house in an interview with the new york times sessions should have never recused himself and if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me before he took the job and i would have picked somebody else trump said too close for comfort insiders worry about doj lawyers speaking at white house former justice department veterans said those remarks reflected a deep misunderstanding of the culture at the justice department and the fbi which try to insulate their work from politics and a sense that trump was acknowledging he wanted his attorney general to protect him in the russia investigation not get to the bottom of the matter the issue gnawed at trump who days later issued a series of early morning tweets on july 22 2017 wondering why democrat hillary clinton and comey were not under investigation for unspecified offenses he repeated the question on july 24 2017 referring to sessions as our beleaguered a g the political establishment in washington d c began wondering aloud how long sessions could keep his job at first former colleagues in the senate mobilized and came to his aid defending his integrity sen lindsey graham r s c told reporters if jeff sessions is fired there will be holy hell to pay sen chuck grassley r iowa who leads the senate judiciary committee tweeted no way would he hold confirmation hearings for a new attorney general in 2017 attacks on sessions could be a red line for gop senators for his part sessions told tucker carlson of fox news that the barbs from trump had been hurtful but that he served at the pleasure of the president attorney general of everything else sessions kept working he flew to el salvador for a series of anti gang meetings in late july 2017 there the attorney general told graduates of a law enforcement academy that he was blessed to serve as the highest justice official in the united states it is an honor i never expected nor one i ever would have thought possible sessions said and while there are good days and bad days in any job one thing has been clear to me it is a privilege to serve one s country in law enforcement to wake up each morning and fight the fight for the rule of law and sessions continued to set the broad priorities of the justice department including a crackdown on illegal immigration and support for cases of religious liberty although those priorities sometimes came into conflict his boss trump appeared to have less respect for the legal system after the special counsel unsealed indictments against his onetime campaign chairman paul manafort and manafort deputy richard gates on oct 30 2017 trump insisted there was no collusion with russia and reiterated his view that the investigation was a waste of time in early november 2017 trump told reporters a lot of people are disappointed in the justice department including me he said he was frustrated he could not direct doj or the fbi to take action in specific cases remarks that justice department veterans consider a serious breach at the same time questions about sessions conduct during the campaign resurfaced after a guilty plea by onetime foreign policy aide george papadopoulos papadopoulos told prosecutors that he tried to set up a meeting between trump and russian president vladimir putin during the campaign and that he mentioned it at a march 2016 meeting attended by both trump and sessions attorney general jeff sessions is worn in before testyfying at a house judiciary committee hearing on november 14 2017 in washington d c these facts appear to contradict your sworn testimony on several occasions democrats on the house judiciary committee pointed out in a letter to the attorney general my story has never changed attorney general jeff sessions tells house committee my story has never changed attorney general jeff sessions tells house committee sessions would get another chance on capitol hill to explain what he did in 2016 and how it related to russia in essence he argued he had a memory lapse and recent news accounts of the papadopoulos plea refreshed his recollection,Fake
yes the democrats flipped the house but that may not be the big story for the next congress,as best i can tell right now the gop lost 32 house seats last night 241 in the 115th congress down to 209 in the 116th this flips the control of the house to the democrats as i said earlier make no mistake about it this is a loss that i would rather not have suffered but in was not a shock the average mid term loss to the president s party is 30 seats and this was a meh election not a wave election the real story is in the senate as i write this the gop held onto battleground seats in tennessee and arizona they lost nevada they flipped indiana missouri and north dakota florida is heading to a recount with rick scott in the lead i think he ll hang on jon tester may hold onto his seat in montana when all votes are finally counted suddenly large numbers of ballots from democrat strongholds are appearing the gop seems certain to gain four and maybe five seats from last night what makes this significant is that the last time a president s party gained seats in the senate in a midterm was 2002 when george w bush had one pickup before him nixon gained two seats in 1970 and jfk added 4 in 1962 so while the party occupying the presidency losing seats in midterms is sort of baked in the same is even more true of the senate if matt rosendale does hold in in montana to give the gop five wins it will be second only to fdr s 1934 gain of 9 seats find out more 39 594 the addition of as many as four seats to the thin one seat majority means that mitch mcconnell can afford to ignore susan collins and lisa murkowski it means that the confirmation of conservative jurists will be easier it means that the selection of cabinet officials particularly someone to replace jeff sessions will allow for more conservative candidates to win confirmation with the absence of mccain and flake and corker the senate is less likely to sign onto any bogus comprehensive immigration reform not only because the democrat house demands will be bat crazy but because the gop caucus is less immigration friendly than it was in the last two congresses what happened last night in the house was a set back but whatever we lost in the house we made up for by increasing a senate majority and moving the senate gop caucus a little further to the right and that is important,Fake
democrats lost the popular vote in senate races so there s only one solution left,this is one of the oddest talking points out there today and it is a clear sign that people who are repeatedly losing have no idea how to take it anymore democrats have a 12 point lead in the overall popular vote for the senate and have lost three seats evan hill evanchill november 7 2018 1 in the senate 56 of voters voted democrat yet we dont have the senate this is why we must end gop gerrymandering cheating democrats had 37 million votes for the senate republicans had 29 million votes for the senate find out more 39 664 yet republicans ended up with 10 more senate seats pic twitter com zqpa7ocaar michelle hairston hairmich42 november 7 2018 we must end gop gerrymandering to win back the states they believe and honestly i m not sure how some of these people function on a day to day basis the only solution that appears viable at this point is to take the democratic dream of open borders and apply it to the states we must either redraw or completely get rid of state borders and the laws surrounding them i know it sounds crazy you guys but if you want the truth it s actually crazy emigrate while you still can learn more there is no logic in the argument at all many people who are upset at the loss of senate seats last night despite democratic gains in the house are the same people who are actively seek to eliminate the electoral college and amend the rights guaranteed in the first and second amendments they truly believe that it is the fault of others or outside forces that cost them these elections it was russia who destroyed hillary s chances it wasn t that she was a terrible out of touch candidate who campaigned in all the wrong areas it is the alt right qanon and online trolls and racists who are keeping the republicans in power not the voters that democrats actively alienate rather than try to reach out to and compromise with it is not their fault ever that they lose so clearly we must redraw state borders for the good of america,Fake

supreme court endorses political corruption,high court endorses political corruption by mustang chief justice of the united states john roberts was underwhelming in his acceptance of the so called obama healthcare plan it is a tax he said and the federal government is permitted under the constitution to tax the bejesus out of the american people well no conservative he and i personally think he was stretching a bit to find that the aca was constitutional it was after all far more than a tax i conclude that judge roberts like everyone in congress who voted for it never read the law before he made his decision well what did we expect he was a bush appointee but roberts really outdid himself in the mcdonnell decision one may recall that while serving as governor of virginia bob mcdonnell solicited a fifty thousand dollar loan from jonnie r williams he then texted an aide about making damn sure that williams got the meetings he wanted with virginia state officials mcdonnell didn t stop there he also accepted as a gift a rolex watch a 20 000 loan and the payment for the catering bill for his daughter s wedding mrs mcdonnell virginia s first lady was the individual who suggested to williams that her husband needed a new watch and presumably a timex wouldn t do well and while she was at it find out more 40 367 maureen could use a new wardrobe totaling 20 000 considering all of mr williams gifts the mcdonnell s accepted 175 000 00 most of us would conclude that there may not be a clearer case of political corruption facilitating access to state officials in return for a very large chunk of change and a few trinkets it sounds corrupt to me but this isn t how chief justice roberts viewed it the court ruled that the virginia jury was wrong to think that governor mcdonnell s actions constituted official corruption the mcdonnell conviction was overturned and in the process the supreme court established a new standard for determining the government corruption a standard so narrow that it will in the future be difficult to convict any but the most incompetent of our politicians while an official act can still be illegal the definition of that term has been excessively broad something as commonplace as an executive turning to an aide and telling him or her to make something happen or accepting a check and then having a quiet word with government regulators or even a suggestion to subordinates that a door ought to be opened for an influence buyer does not in and of itself represent an official act no of course not emigrate while you still can learn more chief justice roberts opined that an official act must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court a determination before an agency or a hearing before a committee what right in the absence of a gavel there is no bribery or corruption i ll call this the smoking gavel rule roberts said that bribery is the kind of thing that can be put on an agenda tracked for progress and then checked off as complete well i suppose the court is at least consistent in the citizens united case the court allowed rich people to purchase politicians now they are able to purchase office holders as well one pundit suggested that the high court was worried that if the mcdonnell conviction was upheld all of our politicians would begin to live in a state of fear as opposed to say strutting around like the arrogant asses they are sure that almost anyone could go to prison for being corrupt god forbid that should ever happen justice roberts wrote conscientious public officials arrange meetings for constituents contact other officials on their behalf and include them in events all the time if mcdonnell s conviction was upheld it would cast a pall of potential prosecution over these relationships he added officials might wonder whether they could respond to even the most commonplace requests for assistance and citizens with legitimate concerns might shrink from participating in democratic discourse has america s high court come to accept the premise that corrupt politics is simply how politics is done it is certainly true that trading cash favors trips to europe expensive gifts and gifts of underage prostitutes is a common occurrence in our government today interestingly during the court s deliberations it accepted a number of amicus briefs from white house lawyers who argued that the business of politics as we know it would be disturbed if the mcdonnell decision were upheld what white house lawyers i don t know their names but it was during the obama administration bottom line influence peddling as a form of corruption has been upheld by the highest court in the land to everyone imagining that the supreme court was our last hope for a just america think again,Fake

political norm or voter fury toward president trump 1 it was a mediocre night for both parties as a lifelong republican i am delighted that we expanded our majority in the senate president trump can continue transforming the judiciary and should be able to bring a supreme court nominee through the senate confirmation process relatively unscathed as well as a replacement for former attorney general jeff sessions a republican senate can also prevent bills originating in the house from becoming law but republicans should all be concerned about how narrow the margins of victory were in states like florida and texas two battleground states that are key to trump s bid for reelection amendment 4 was on the ballot in florida the initiative which passed will restore voting rights to more than one million felons considering who felons are most likely to vote for and that now governor elect ron desantis prevailed over andrew gillum by only 43 190 votes and now senator elect rick scott won by only 30 264 votes republicans should be worried about 2020 i know that voting is probably not a top priority for many felons but if only 10 of them voted it would mean 140 000 additional democratic votes enough to have handed a victory to both gillum and bill nelson find out more 70 404 2 the electoral landscape in texas a state with 38 electoral votes has been changing over the years it is a state that is a must win for trump in 2020 my worry here is although i m delighted ted cruz won he should have won by a larger margin governor greg abbott won reelection by 13 5 points and cruz beat beto o rourke by only 2 6 points granted cruz is rather unlikeable but the state seems to be slowly turning blue especially and almost counterintuitively the districts that border mexico although most of the map appears red the populous cities of dallas austin houston and corpus christi are turning bluer rush limbaugh discussed what s going on in texas on his radio show they think they won with beto losing last night because he got so close and because of all the money he raised they re now touting beto as their presidential front runner bunch of democrats bunch of hollywood leftists think this is the guy because he almost won but if you look at texas the way we re describing here every county i don t think there s a single exception every county of texas starting with el paso that comes down and borders mexico is democrat now how many there in that area are here via illegal immigration and otherwise so it is a challenge i mean going forward how long can this keep up what s the demographic distribution of where these people are how young are the people in the metro areas versus in the suburban and rural there s texas we haven t lost texas yet the democrats are not gon na stop until they take texas there s 38 electoral votes if they get texas they ve got a lock on the presidency forever california new york illinois texas that s all they need now take a look at that folks you see dallas you see san antonio houston corpus christi little specks of blue there in population centers in texas fort worth is not quite blue but it s not red either nor pink but fully 75 80 of that state county by county is red but take a look at that border with mexico and you see two little sections of pink there near el paso and outside of that it is solid blue that is one of the best graphics i could show you to illustrate the necessity of serious border control however it s done a wall staffed about you sic numbers of people to keep people from coming in however it s done that right there is one of the ways in which texas is being taken over invaded infiltrated whatever word you want to use photo credit screenshot from rushlimbaugh com now that s a microcosm for the whole country the whole country if you look at the continental 48 the vast majority of it s gon na be red until you get to population centers where it s solid the blue and solid blue is where santa claus is big liberal cities and states where they give away everything that s where santa claus is 3 republicans have nearly lost the state of virginia sen tim kaine easily held onto his seat democrats picked up three new house seats adding to the four seats they held onto republicans held onto four seats limbaugh said the democrats have totally flipped virginia it s gone the democrats are one election away from totally flipping north carolina if you live in raleigh durham you essentially live in new york city now if you re republican and you live in raleigh durham you may as well live in manhattan because your political life is no different 4 a democratic house majority means gridlock some see that as a positive the stock market likes gridlock on the other hand few of the important issues will be resolved although the senate will be able to prevent passage of any unreasonable bills keeping a check on the house the enactment of much of president trump s planned agenda will become impossible frivolous investigations will be initiated and time and tax dollars will be wasted house committees will be led by such undesirables as the repellent adam schiff the radical maxine waters and the inane nancy pelosi surprisingly trump expressed his support of pelosi to return to her old role as speaker of the house maybe he thinks her antics will provide some inflammatory material for 2020 campaign ads 5 at 9 33 on tuesday night fox news called the house for the democrats their new voter analysis program allowed them to make this projection before polls had closed in the western part of the country which should be illegal their job is to report the news not to influence the news all of the networks likely had the new voter analysis program as well but following the debacle of the florida recount in 2000 when multiple networks called the state for al gore before polls had closed in the panhandle portion of the state which was located in a different time zone they ve learned something it s now well known that all five tv networks and the associated press declared florida for al gore at 7 50 p m eastern time 10 minutes before the polls closed in the panhandle counties that could not have dissuaded many voters from casting ballots but far more serious was the announcement by all five networks at 7 p m eastern time that the polls in florida had closed as brill s content reported at 7 p m et every network was talking about the poll closings in nine states and every network was wrong the polls were closing in only eight states the polls in that heavily republican panhandle of florida wouldn t close for another hour 8 p m et the networks with the exception of fox news channel continued to repeat this misinformation throughout that hour,Fake

buy em or deny em will the marlins sandy alcantara be a breakout candidate in 2019,by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor we all know that the marlins are in the midst of a rebuild we also know that the pitching staff is in flux meaning that they are going to continue giving young pitchers opportunities in the rotation one such pitcher should be sandy alcantara who they acquired as part of the marcell ozuna trade they gave him six starts late in 2018 and while his 3 44 era over 34 0 ip gives a sense of hope the other numbers are vastly different just look at the main metrics we look at for any pitcher strikeouts 7 94 k 9 control 6 09 bb 9 groundballs 47 7 the strikeout rate was actually better than his triple a mark 6 85 over 115 2 ip his 10 4 swstr does give a sense of hope that he can maintain the mark and is right inline with his 9 9 mark at triple a granted that s not going to make him an elite starter but it would be enough if he carried another skill that s where things get concerning because you have to wonder if there s anything that we can hang our hat on alcantara s groundball rate in the majors is obviously unspectacular and while his 49 4 at triple a was better it also isn t going to blow you away while he was a little bit better over the course of his minor league career a go ao of 1 08 at triple a and 1 01 at double a is fairly pedestrian pitching in miami helps but is it really enough find out more 82 329 then you have the control which has never been elite obviously he s not as bad as he showed in the majors but a 3 5 bb 9 in the minors is mediocre and tells us that he s going to have his issues a year later these are the same concerns we had of him after he was traded to miami when we gave him a c grade and said another piece of the marcell ozuna trade alcantara reached the majors last season making 8 appearances out of the bullpen he struggled with his control while there 6 48 bb 9 and that s just a continuation of what he s been doing in the minors the past two years single a 90 1 ip 4 48 bb 9 high a 32 1 ip 3 90 bb 9 double a 125 1 ip 3 88 bb 9 he also didn t generate many groundballs while at double a 44 8 and struggled with home runs during his time in the majors 2 16 hr 9 there s swing and miss stuff and upside in the 22 year old but you also have to wonder if he s ultimately ticketed for the bullpen or if he can solve the two obvious flaws could alcantara take a step forward in his development maybe but at this point don t count on it at best he should be seen as a streaming option especially pitching at home but in most formats he s not going to be worth trusting if he gets the opportunity sources fangraphs baseball reference milb com pre order the 2019 draft guide today pre order rotoprofessor s 2018 fantasy baseball draft guide for just 7 75 click here for the details but don t miss out on the best bargain in fantasy baseball preparation make sure to check out all of our 2019 projections player date posted dylan bundy 10 22 18 foltynewicz mike 10 09 18 gibson kyle 10 29 18 hoskins rhys 10 16 18 hosmer eric 11 05 18 wheeler zack 10 02 18,Fake

crystal ball scratching,with just under seven weeks to go until christmas the next couple of months are very important for clubs chasing promotion or trying to avoid relegation as there are no particularly outstanding games in the championship this weekend i thought i d gaze into my crystal ball this week to make some quick predictions especially as we ve got another bl dy international break coming up next weekend it looks as if i m going to have to eat my words about leeds they re much better than i thought they d be and there s a chance that by boxing day they may have secured pole position their key game before the festivities is a trip to bramall lane on december 1st looking further ahead february may be the key month for leeds but we ll cross that bridge when we come to it leeds biggest rivals for automatic promotion are middlesbrough and wba but although marcelo bielsa s side are well balanced tony pulis and darren moore s men have glaring issues middlesbrough don t score enough goals whilst wba s defence is non existent only four teams have conceded more goals than the baggies and two of them are in the bottom three along with leeds birmingham and nottingham forest are unrecognisable from last season the latter pair have become tough to beat but may need to wait another season for a realistic chance of promotion forest s best case scenario is the playoffs norwich aren t as good as the current table suggests they ve done well against the bottom half of the table but have already lost at home to leeds and wba they have a reasonable looking schedule this month december will be far harder sheffield wednesday are worse than the current table suggests current owners of the worst defensive record in the division they ve played 12 games against the teams currently above them and lost seven of those contests winning just twice they face sheffield united on friday sky sports football main event 7 45pm this evening and derby later in the month as it stands paul lambert has a well nigh impossible task of keeping ipswich from dropping into the third tier for the first time since the late 1950s but i d expect rotherham and bolton to be drawn into the relegation battle over the next few weeks both teams are struggling to score goals at the moment there are three other clubs that have scored less than a goal per game including qpr who are currently eleventh and are second in the eight game form table behind norwich reading and preston will continue to make progress up the table and although i don t think reading will trouble the top half preston are more than capable of doing that even though they look as if they ve left it too late for a playoff challenge televised games this week sky sports football main event unless stated i ve already mentioned the sheffield derby which is always entertaining and shouldn t be missed if you ve got the opportunity to watch the other game on sky sports this weekend is between wba and leeds at the hawthorns tomorrow 5 30pm for some of us that ll bring back memories of a very controversial game from the 1970 71 season,Fake

in the outfield and mound with his middle infield the only soft spot with hans wagner moving to first base although the only off season move to improve it was to claim greenfield jimmy smith off waivers and to emphatically deny rumors that he was leaving to skipper another squad jimmy wasn t a very good prognosticator the pirates started off 20 40 and he was fired hans wagner briefly took the reins followed by hugo bezdek but it didn t stop the bleeding the bucs finished 51 103 in 1917 in eighth and last place 47 games behind the champion new york giants nixey should have jumped if he had

cc sabathia returns to new york but should fantasy owners care,the yankees quest to upgrade their pitching staff has led them back to a familiar name as earlier this week they resigned cc sabathia to a one year 8 million contract at 38 years old he ll turn 39 during the 2019 season it s fair to wonder exactly what he has left in the tank though the southpaw s performance last season creates some intrigue 153 0 ip 9 wins 3 65 era 1 31 whip 140 strikeouts 8 24 k 9 51 walks 3 00 bb 9 44 4 groundball rate 295 babip those are respectable numbers though we can t overlook the innings he s now worked 153 innings or fewer in back to back seasons and hasn t eclipsed 180 innings since 2013 in other words you know he s going to miss time and it s possible the yankees view him as just a partial option and not someone that s going to take the ball every five days over the entire season in terms of his performance on the mound the once hard thrower does appear to have made the transition to become more of a pitcher it also doesn t appear that he benefited from much luck given the babip which came courtesy of a 28 5 hard and 75 5 strand rate at the same time is anyone truly buying in to this type of era while sabathia s control isn t a question his strikeout rate and home runs allowed are the strikeout rate was a big jump over his recent marks though he also altered his approach after introducing his cutter as a significant pitch in 2016 the usage went to a new level in 2018,Fake

week 10 rankings 2018 top 15 defenses,as we look forward to this week it is clear that there are a multitude of match ups that are far from appealing what that does mean is that from the perspective of fantasy defenses there are some options out there while they might not truly jump off the page at you there should at least be limited risk with that being said let s take a look at how our options rank new york jets vs buffalo kansas city chiefs vs arizona la rams vs seattle chicago bears vs detroit indianapolis colts vs jacksonville washington redskins at tampa bay la chargers at oakland carolina panthers at pittsburgh buffalo bills at ny jets atlanta falcons at cleveland jacksonville jaguars at indianapolis cleveland browns vs atlanta new england patriots at tennessee san francisco 49ers vs ny giants miami dolphins at green bay thoughts just because the bills are pretty close to being unwatchable and generally ignored from a fantasy perspective it doesn t mean we should just dismiss them and no i m not looking to do anything crazy and count on nathan peterman to provide fantasy value instead i am looking at their defense while the offense doesn t do their teammates any favors buffalo s defense has held their own they are facing an offense that isn t much better than their own in week 10 and at 19 6 ownership they should be targeted the new york jets have failed to generate a consistent running game their center can t be counted on to snap the ball cleanly penalties are an issue options at the skill positions are lacking and sam darnold will also be sidelined while the bills only have six interceptions under their belt they do have 22 sacks this isn t exactly an every week play but the bills should be a popular option for week 10 the focus is always going to be on kansas city s offense but while their defense isn t what it was in years past it also shouldn t be ignored in fact they are still coming in as a borderline top 5 defense and their opponent this week arizona has allowed the second most points to opposing defenses so far this season the chiefs with their consistent quarterback pressure 26 sacks should be able to take advantage of josh rosen with an interception in each of the past three weeks kansas city should continue that streak against the rookie quarterback and with the chiefs offense likely to have a strong game rosen will be forced to play catch up which should put him on his heels one defense that doesn t have the best of reputations is the colts owned in just 14 of leagues indianapolis faces a jaguars team that while they appear to be getting leonard fournette back are allowing the seventh most points to opposing fantasy defenses in five of their eight games the colts have allowed 28 points or more they still have yet to have negative scoring day with nine interceptions seven fumble recoveries and 19 sacks indianapolis does enough to generate some value pre order sale pre order rotoprofessor s 2018 fantasy baseball draft guide for just 6 75 click here for the details but don t miss out on the best bargain in fantasy baseball preparation make sure to check out all of our week 10 rankings,Fake
england squad v all blacks does itself no favours,according to the old clich the definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results zach mercer should be starting and so while chris ashton s first start for england since 2014 may be the headline news from today s announcement of the england squad to take on the all blacks on saturday it is the selection of two second rows on the england bench to the exclusion of the excellent zach mercer that is the biggest cause for concern i would have had mercer playing out of his skin this season starting at number 8 but his entire omission from the matchday squad means that england will have no proper back row cover on saturday with either one of courtney lawes or maro itoje probably having to fill in at flanker if required let s be clear lawes itoje at flanker has never worked previously for england and there s absolutely nothing to suggest that it will be successful this time against what is probably the most effective back row trio in world rugby i had hoped that eddie jones might have learned from previous experience it seems i was mistaken,Fake

made global warming gleick then leaked those documents including one that might have been fake to reporters at the time heartland kept its donors private in part because activists had harassed them in the past gleick did this while chairing the american geophysical union s panel on scientific ethics my judgment was blinded by my frustration with the ongoing efforts often anonymous well funded and

rize expands functional 3d printing with more materials full color,the world is in full color and now so is functional 3d printing with rize s latest introduction today rize announces a significant portfolio enhancement unveiling the full color xrize desktop additive manufacturing system and expanding the materials capabilities of the rize one 3d printer let s start with what s new with the rize one the rize one at rize hq image fabbaloo the rize one at rize hq image fabbaloo since its market debut in 2016 rize s technology has included the capability to mark parts with some color building on this inkjet ability over the years to present digitally augmented additive manufacturing parts that utilize voxel level control to securely mark 3d printed parts having brought rizium one black material to market earlier this year for another popular color option rize now continues its path in responding to customer demand with two new material options find out more 58 915 rizium carbon and rizium endura have joined the rizium material family the former reinforced with carbon fiber is designed for functional prototyping for manufacturing while the fiber reinforced rizium endura offers high accuracy and high impact strength the latter is also compatible with rize s full color inks which leads us to xrize full color 3d printing has represented something of a holy grail especially when it comes to functional parts i was fortunate to find myself in boston recently and had the time to get hands on with these new full color parts and to hear first hand from rize ceo andy kalambi vice president of product kishore boyalakuntla and vice president of marketing julie reece l r kishore julie and andy at rize hq image fabbaloo l r kishore julie and andy at rize hq image fabbaloo what we have with xrize is what we like to call the world s first safe strong multi material desktop industrial printer with minimal post processing boyalakuntla explained what we re seeing is that color 3d printing is very messy and you often get parts that are not functional or if they are they are very expensive the innovation our team did is very unique we don t talk about it enough but it really is voxel level with true color capabilities the imagination is the limit the world is in color right kalambi looked to the world of 2d printing as the precedent for the adoption of color with the first introductions of color 2d printers people thought they knew some uses but the users kept expanding on that no one buys black and white printers anymore he said today we believe color will redefine how people look at 3d printed parts never before has this been possible except with expense and complexity attached to making those parts we wanted to maintain simplicity and safety while creating functional lifelike parts we ve seen functional parts that are not lifelike and lifelike parts that are not functional now we push toward new end users toward marketing professionals designers architects and not just engineers those kinds of applications will explode we live in color we are bringing 3d printing to the real world in a way as we spoke i handled a few full color parts including a topographical map and a faithful replica of a fanta can both fully readable i surreptitiously worked to bend or break another part but it didn t budge after i came clean about having been trying to squeeze it boyalakuntla encouraged me to try harder still nothing we are not going to announce anything that s not working boyalakuntla said with a smile and people want color tv 2d anything that is color explodes squeezing this did nothing image fabbaloo squeezing this did nothing image fabbaloo the xrize jets cmyk inks during the printing process with its augmented polymer

expansion of offerings for the rize one today s announcements also include rize connect debuting at formnext rize connect represents a logical step to take advantage of iot and the intelligence that comes with that to help customers design and get feedback and analytics boyalakuntla explained it captures valuable information and gives users proactive feedback to help them sequence things faster better and to execute what they need to do to maximize throughput on a fleet of printers both the rize one and xrize he continued rize will be showcasing all these announcements at formnext as well as offering a show only special for the new xrize any orders placed during formnext for an xrize with a 55k msrp will become a two for one bundle that also includes a rize one the rize one will ship

the childrens crusade thousands of children march to holy land but never return,the children s crusade is one of the more unusual events that occurred in medieval england in the year 1212 tens of thousands of self proclaimed unarmed crusading children set out from northern france and western germany to regain jerusalem from the muslims while never actually receiving official sanction the so called crusade was a disaster none of the children reached the holy land many were said to have been sold into slavery and thousands never returned at all the major crusades between the 11th and 13th centuries seven major crusades were launched by christians in europe against muslims that were in control of the holy land in addition to these major military campaigns to the east the latin roman catholic church also sanctioned numerous minor crusades against her enemies these included the albigensian crusade 1208 1241 aimed at eradicating the cathar heretics of southern france and the northern crusades 1193 1290 against the pagans of northern europe yet one of the most bizarre episodes in the history of the crusades is perhaps the so called children s crusade said to have taken place in 1212 according to a 13th century source the chronica regia coloniensis royal chronicle of cologne the children s crusade began around easter or pentecost of 1212 many thousands of boys ranging in age from six years to full maturity left the plows or carts they were driving the flocks which they were pasturing and anything else which they were doing this they did despite the wishes of their parents relatives and friends who sought to make them draw back suddenly one ran after another to take the cross thus by groups of twenty or fifty or a hundred they put up banners and began to journey to jerusalem find out more 59 245 the departure an episode of the childs crusade 13th century by joanna mary boyce the departure an episode of the child s crusade 13th century by joanna mary boyce wikimedia commons the children claimed that it was the will of the divine that prompted them to undertake this crusade in spite of this their expedition did not achieve its intention in the end some were turned back at metz others at piacenza and others even at rome still others got to marseilles but whether they crossed to the holy land or what their end was is uncertain the author ends the account on a grim note one thing is sure that of the many thousands who rose up only very few returned stephen and nicholas leaders of the children s crusade more recent versions of the story have suggested that there were actually two separate groups of children involved in this crusade the first group came from france led by a peasant boy called stephen of cloyes the boy claimed that christ had appeared to him in a dream and delivered a letter from heaven stephen assembled a group of young followers in the city of vend me and then marched to saint denis just outside paris where he intended to pass the contents of his letter to the french king philip ii the king however was not amused by the young crusader did not even bothered meeting him and told them to go home although some took the king s advice and went home many others took their place it is said that stephen succeeded in gathering 30 000 children and led them to marseilles where they would cross the mediterranean to the holy land the children s crusade by gustave dor the children s crusade by gustave dor wikimedia commons at the same time another army of child crusaders was gathering in germany their leader was a boy from cologne called nicholas and he is reported to have attracted about 50 000 followers unlike stephen however nicholas followers included a small number of adults as well though they were probably not in charge these crusades travelled from germany to italy across the alps and are said to have even met the pope in rome whilst the pope praised the children for their bravery he also told them that they were too young to undertake such a venture with that most of the crusaders returned to germany though many of them would die on the way a few determined youngsters boarded ships intended for the holy land and then disappeared completely from history the children s crusade 1212 wikimedia commons although the children s crusade is referenced in more than 50 chronicles dating from the 13th century many question the accounts that have been given and suspect they were at best an embellished version of what actually occurred emigrate while you still can learn more the children s crusade was not a crusade in its truest sense as the pope did not call for it nor sanction it rather it was a popular movement whose details remain obscure and hard to trace which was spurred on by religious fervour and fanaticism that sadly resulted in thousands of deaths what makes a children s crusade some have even questioned if the children s crusade was even a movement led by youth at all for example peter raedts reviewed documentation of the crusade and suggested in 1977 that they were as history com writes participants in the children s crusade had existed on the margins of society they may have believed it was up to poor and marginalized people to take up the flag for christianity after the first crusades failed raedts concluded the crusaders were not really children but poor people,Fake

indicated a 14 reduction in growth rates between 1990 and 2005 it stated that the corals of the gbr are declining at a rate unprecedented in coral records reaching back 400 years subsequent reanalysis of the data indicated that the apparent recent reduction in growth rate was caused by a problems with the physical measurements of calcification which systematically biased recent growth bands to give lower growth rates d olivio et al 2013 ridd et al 2013 and b an unjustified assumption that coral growth rate does not change with the age of the coral ridd et al 2013 with these taken into account the dramatic fall in growth rate after 1990 is no longer evident and a small increase in growth rates since the early 1900 s appears fig 6 further d olivio et al 2013 working on a different set of gbr corals showed an increase in coral calcification rates on middle and outer shelf reefs which together represent 99 of gbr corals of 10 for the period 1950 to 2005 but a decrease of 5 per decade between 1930 and 2008 on inner shelf reefs which represent only 1 of gbr corals therefore it would be hard to glean from these datasets that there is a documented decline in coral growth parameters

until i was seven years old the day my father brought home the black and white zenith television so that he could watch the news in the morning there began a long term confrontation with my mother she refused to let us watch the children shows why she said that the stories taught children how to disobey their parents and that was wrong her children would not be allowed to disobey needless to say my mother s decision put her children outside of the circle of conversation within their peer group we could not talk about the adventures of lassie or flicka or fury or mighty mouse or disney movies we did not watch them second today i am a grandmother with three adorable grandchildren i see the children about two times each year because distance separates us in 2016 they came to visit i was sitting on the carport enjoying my four year old granddaughter play with her two year old brother while playing my granddaughter said brother we choose evil don t we to which he responded yep instantly i said oh no you don t you choose to be good that is important the stared at me with a blank expression and then turned back to playing with the toys they have wonderful parents who strive to help the community and raise good children unfortunately the children are getting a serious message from demonic dung that spews from the demonic dynasties on earth the false teachings have already interrupted the family s moral training quietly and without warning third i began to explore where the idea entered into my children s minds i visited them in 2018 it did not take long to find the demonic source my grandchildren are not allowed to watch television during the week on weekends they are allowed an indulgence on saturday my granddaughter chose a disney videotape to watch and she insisted that her grandmother watch it with her in the video in big bold letters was a sign behind the dancers that stated we choose evil the musical song which my granddaughter can sing for memory stated the same words i looked at the television and stated very clearly i do not like this movie it is evil i walked out of the room my grandchildren were stunned they began to tell me no grana this is a good movie we had a very brief conversation and i held my ground fourth in the 1960s there was a song entitled where have all the flowers gone the chorus asks when will they ever learn that remains the question when will adults choose goodness if one takes any ancient religion and reads the literature it is obvious that ancient men recognized that there is a difference between good and evil even the atheist philosophers discussed it in the 1950s unfortunately our nation was treated to a huge disinformation campaign concerning that choice the seminaries were filled with human secular professors they taught the young priests and pastors that god is dead and that the entire idea of god is a myth i remember in 1960 as a first grader attending sunday school there was a change no longer did we study the bible but we started studying the united nations the mind bending literature continued into my adult years we were brain washed with false teachings which were coming out of the mouths of our trusted adults like parents teachers and pastors if one questioned the facts there was severe punishment one was branded as a trouble maker and banished from the discussion in 1986 a team of parents

for many centuries before then ancient chinese astronomical data accuracy is unsurpassed and was not overtaken by western accuracy until the 15th century this is demonstrated for example with halley s comet which appears in the sky every 70 to 75 years and was painted by chinese astronomers from about 3000 years ago detail of astrology manuscript ink on silk 2nd century bc han dynasty unearthed

was later named halley s comet comets in the middle ages by the middle ages fear of comets had reached astronomical proportions and they were believed to portend natural disasters like floods and earthquakes these so called tailed stars appeared in famous works of art such as the fresco adoration of the magi by renaissance painter giotto di bondone in the cappella degli scrovegni in padua

illness pestilence and death difficult times shortages and times of great famine in 1540 ad peter bienewitz 1495 1552 was the first astronomer of modern times to make the observation that comets tails always pointed away from the sun he wrote about this in his book astronomicum caesareum three decades later the famous danish astronomer tycho brahe 1546 1601 measured the parallax of a comet which appeared in 1577 ad to be around 230 earth radii corresponding to 1 5 million kilometers this measurement refuted the teachings of aristotle who believed comets to be phenomena generated within the terrestrial atmosphere and brahe proved that comets were independent celestial bodies about a terrible and marvelous comet as appeared the tuesday after st martins day 1577 11 12 on heaven written by

title page of hevelius cometographia published in 1665 ad on one hand tycho brahe predicted that comets would return periodically however johannes kepler 1571 1630 believed they projected in straight lines this argument was later settled by danzig alderman and astronomer johannes hevelius 1611 1687 who proposed that comets traveled in elongated parabolas and hyperbolas as we now know they do

trajectory in scholar peter lancaster brown s 1985 book halley his comet we learn that with this primary observation halley entered a world of celestial dynamics and spherical geometry and he calculated that the comets elongated ellipse should cause it to return in 1758 on the evening of december 25 1758 the amateur astronomer johann georg palitzsch 1723 1788 reported a weak spot of light

third largest city find out more 25 930 the crime spree is a terrible blight on that city he said at a convention of the international association of chiefs of police trump said he had ordered attorney general jeff sessions to immediately go to chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave he also encouraged the city to embrace the stop and frisk policing method in which large numbers of people are temporarily detained questioned and sometimes searched for drugs and weapons it was used extensively in new york city until it was deemed unconstitutional because of its overwhelming impact on minority residents got ta be properly applied but stop and frisk works said trump who had traveled to orlando with deputy attorney general rod rosenstein chicago police said last week that there have been 102 fewer homicides and nearly 500 fewer shooting victims in the city this year compared with the first nine months of 2017 the city of chicago reached an agreement with the american civil liberties union of illinois in 2015 to curb stop and frisk procedures after the aclu threatened to file a lawsuit over the issue the aclu said the police inordinately targeted blacks a spokesman for mayor rahm emanuel blasted trump for reviving criticism of the city s homicide rate and the agreement with the aclu even someone as clueless as donald trump has to know stop and frisk is simply not the solution to crime matt mcgrath said in an emailed statement the aclu of illinois karen sheley said trump s comments were neither accurate nor helpful the trump administration has consistently encouraged strong arm tactics and unconstitutional practices by police she said adding the solutions to violence in chicago are not going to come from donald trump the white house and justice department didn t immediately respond to requests for more details on what trump had asked sessions to do chicago s violent crime has repeatedly drawn national attention and trump s as shootings and homicides climbed to levels not seen in nearly two decades but the number of homicides has fallen from 771 in 2016 to 650 in 2017 with a further decline expected this year the number of slayings still exceeds numbers in los angeles and new york combined a report last year by former u s magistrate judge arlander keys to assess how chicago was compiling with the agreement on stop and frisk noted a dramatic decrease in the number of stops since the aclu lawsuit but found that officers were still targeting racial minorities the number of investigatory stops fell from more than 1 3 million in 2014 and 2015 to just over 54 000 in the first six months of 2016 the report said emanuel who recently announced he will not seek a third term has clashed several times with trump over the gun violence soon after becoming president trump tweeted if chicago doesn t fix the horrible carnage going on i will send in the feds emanuel said he welcomed federal help but cautioned against the strictly tough and rough approach trump seemed to advocate trump s comments came three days after a jury convicted white chicago police officer jason van dyke of second degree murder in the death of black teenager laquan mcdonald video showing van dyke shooting mcdonald 16 times as he walked away from police carrying a knife stoked outrage nationwide and put the nation s third largest city at the center of the debate about police misconduct and use of force trump in his remarks monday singled out politicians who have criticized police often in the wake of shootings of young black men politicians who spread dangerous anti police sentiment make life easier for criminals and more dangerous for law abiding citizens he said just weeks before the midterm elections trump accused democrats of being soft on crime the democrats fight us at every turn whether it s law enforcement or military they fight us at every turn and we win trump said and he blamed evil people for nearly

thanks to the government s ongoing efforts to build massive databases using emerging surveillance dna and biometrics technologies big brother and his corporate partners in crime is getting even creepier and more invasive intrusive and stalker like indeed every dystopian sci fi film and horror film for that matter we ve ever seen is suddenly converging into this present moment in a dangerous trifecta between science and technology big business and a government that wants to be all seeing all knowing and all powerful but not without help from the citizenry on a daily basis americans are relinquishing in many cases voluntarily the most intimate details of who we are our biological makeup our genetic blueprints and our biometrics facial characteristics and structure fingerprints iris

of high tech spy movies millions of mobile phone bank and investment customers now have these technologies at their fingertips schwab uses voice recognition apple uses fingerprints wells fargo scans eyes and other companies are developing heartbeat or grip technology to verify user identity whether biometric technology will thrive or meet its demise depends not only on the security of the technology but also whether the u s legal system will adapt to provide the privacy protections necessary for consumers to use it and for companies to invest in its development currently there is no federal law and only one state with a law protecting biometric information translation thus far the courts have done little to preserve our rights in the face of technologies and government programs that have little respect for privacy or freedom emigrate while you still can learn more consider all the ways we continue to be tracked hunted hounded and stalked by the government and its dubious agents by tapping into your phone lines and cell phone communications the government knows what you say by uploading all of your emails opening your mail and reading your facebook posts and text messages the government knows what you write by monitoring your movements with the use of license plate readers surveillance cameras and other tracking devices the government knows where you go by churning through all of the detritus of your life what you read where you go what you say the government can predict what you will do by mapping the synapses in your brain scientists and in turn the government will soon know what you remember by mapping your biometrics your face print and storing the information in a massive shared government database available to bureaucratic agencies police and the military the government s goal is to use facial recognition software to identify you and every other person in the country and track your movements wherever you go and by accessing your dna the government will soon know everything else about you that they don t already know your family chart your ancestry what you look like your health history your inclination to follow orders or chart your own course etc of course none of these technologies are foolproof nor are they immune from tampering hacking or user bias nevertheless they have become a convenient tool in the hands of government agents to render null and void the constitution s requirements of privacy and its prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures consequently no longer are we innocent until proven guilty in the face of dna evidence that places us at the scene of a crime behavior sensing technology that interprets our body temperature and facial tics as suspicious and government surveillance devices that cross check our biometrics license plates and dna against a growing database of unsolved crimes and potential criminals increasingly we are all guilty until proven innocent as the government s questionable acquisition and use of biometrics and dna to identify individuals and solve crimes makes clear indeed for years now the fbi and justice department have conspired to acquire near limitless power and control over biometric information collected on law abiding individuals millions of whom have never been accused of a crime going far beyond the scope of those with criminal backgrounds the fbi s next generation identification database ngid a billion dollar boondoggle that is aimed at dramatically expanding the government s id database from a fingerprint system to a vast data storehouse of iris scans photos searchable with face recognition technology palm prints and measures of gait and voice recordings alongside records of fingerprints scars and tattoos launched in 2008 the ngid is a massive biometric database that contains more than 100 million fingerprints and 45 million facial photos gathered from a variety of sources ranging from criminal suspects and convicts to daycare workers and visa applicants including millions of people who have never committed or even been accused of a crime in other words innocent american citizens are now automatically placed in a suspect database for a long time the government was required to at least observe some basic restrictions on when where and how it could access someone s biometrics and dna and use it against them that is no longer the case the information is being amassed through a variety of routine procedures with the police leading the way as prime collectors of biometrics for something as non threatening as a simple moving violation the nation s courts are also doing their part to build the database requiring biometric information as a precursor to more lenient sentences and of course corporate america has made it so easy to use one s biometrics to access everything from bank accounts to cell phones we ve made it so easy for the government to target identify and track us dead or alive it s like shooting fish in a barrel for instance in march 2018 florida police showed up at a funeral home asked to see the corpse of 30 year old linus f phillip and attempted to use the dead man s finger to unlock his cell phone using his biometric fingerprint it turns out cops unlocking cell phones with dead people s fingerprints is now relatively common in 2016 the department of justice secured a warrant allowing police to enter a california residence and force anyone inside to use their biometric information to open their mobile devices two years earlier in 2014 a virginia court declared it legal to use criminal suspects fingerprints to open up smartphones this doesn t even touch on the many ways in which the government is using our dna against us the constitution be damned in 2015 the u s supreme court let stand the maryland court of appeals ruling in raynor v maryland which essentially determined that individuals do not have a right to privacy when it comes to their dna although glenn raynor a suspected rapist willingly agreed to be questioned by police he refused to provide them with a dna sample no problem police simply swabbed the chair in which raynor had been sitting and took what he refused to voluntarily provide raynor s dna was a match and the suspect became a convict in refusing to hear the case the u s supreme court gave its tacit approval for government agents to collect shed dna likening it to a person s fingerprints or the color of their hair eyes or skin whereas fingerprint technology created a watershed moment for police in their ability to crack a case dna technology is now being hailed by law enforcement agencies as the magic bullet in crime solving it s what police like to refer to as a modern fingerprint however unlike a fingerprint a dna print reveals everything about who we are where we come from and who we will be,Fake
grandfather and grandsons detained by officer kicked out of park for drinking kombucha tea,after visiting the grave of their deceased father and son a virginia grandpa and his grandchildren were kicked out of a park for drinking kombucha kombucha chesapeake va sid tatem was trying to enjoy a picnic at chesapeake s northwest river park last week but an overzealous park ranger quickly ruined the family outing the ranger approached tatem and sons inquiring about what they were drinking turns out the trio was enjoying some of grandpa s homemade kombucha a fermented tea that has been around for thousands of years ranger michael peters was informed by tatem the mixture might have residual alcohol from its fermentation but it could hardly be considered an alcoholic beverage kombucha is the fermented tea that is sold in nearly every store across the country and which has an alcohol content so low that children can purchase it legally currently quite a health food rage it s loaded in probiotics vitamins minerals antioxidants and anti inflammatory substances in other words it s really good for you and your body find out more 26 175 however peters detained the family confiscated the kombucha forced them to pour it out and promptly kicked the innocent grandfather and his grandchildren out of the park the three had made a day visiting tatem s father s grave and decided to stop by the park and enjoy some food and family time tatem said i thought it was good clean fun and as far as i m concerned it is the grandfather described the encounter between he his 8 and 14 year old grandsons and peters he said real assertively what are you guys drinking today he was very disturbed convinced i was contributing the delinquency of my grandsons kombucha is not considered an alcoholic drink anywhere grandpa s right kombucha is sold to minors as if it were a soda and the alcohol content is somewhere between 5 and 2 percent hardly enough to have any effect on anyone it is similar to a near beer drink such as the marked brand of beer o douls which has 5 percent alcohol even in texas where weed is still illegal minors can buy o douls and kmobucha tatem described what happened after he attempted to reason with peters i thought this is a losing situation i asked the officer what he wanted us to do he said dump the kombucha out and leave the park we did so in silence predictably peters supervisors stood behind their agent of the state city spokeswoman elizabeth vaughn supported the ranger s decision to confiscate property which didn t belong to him pour it out and send the trio from whence they came vaughn stated the citizen offered up the information that the containers had home brewed kombucha and the fact it contained alcohol seeing it was given to juveniles he was told to leave the park one could say tatem got off pretty lucky had he resisted the confiscation other men with guns could have been called and they could ve been hurt had he chose not surrender his homemade kombucha he could have been tased beaten or possibly even killed we re not exaggerating folks this happens all the time when citizens are determined to flex their rights bad things can often happen tatem had a right not to be contacted by the park ranger he also had a right not to speak with the ranger he also had a right not to be searched and his property seized furthermore the grandpa and his two grandsons had a right to be able to enjoy the park just like everyone else without becoming subject to the american police state,Fake

liberal is tantamount to being a good guy you are fair minded and want people to have the right to do as they wish in freedom you buy into labels like progressive which you equate with fair mindedness liberalism and generally being a member in good standing with the good guy club but you like i when i was younger do not understand what youre being roped into when you assume that these notions are

agony protocols 9 in order that the true meaning of things may not strike the goyim before the proper time we shall mask it under the alleged ardent desire to serve the working classes protocols of zion 6 liberals are dupes what communists call useful idiots i was one for most of my life championing the oppressed was a pathetic way to justify my life and meet women while being blinded to the real enemy as a liberal i believed we stood for the public good while everyone else was for mindless selfish greed bella dodd and the protocols of zion tell a different story communism jpg as i will demonstrate liberals funded by the rockefellers and rothschilds soros etc are unwitting pawns of a satanic communist agenda they are dupes like the lower blue degrees of freemasonry this sounds extreme but unfortunately it is literally true bella dodd 1904 1969 a lawyer and political science professor was a communist party organizer from 1932 1948 and a member of the national council of the cpusa from 1944 48 find out more 27 364 belloc jpegin her book school of darkness she said communists infiltrated and took control of liberal and socialist groups and unions she took control of the ny state teachers union she said communism is a satanic cult that is conspiring to enslave the world in testimony to huac in 1953 she revealed some liberals have allowed themselves to become supporters of the very members of this conspiracy this is not liberalism not liberalism in the finest sense of the word this is just allowing the communist to pull them into a propaganda environment which says that anyone who is close to the communist is a liberal i do not believe that is the definition of a liberal she offered the classical definition a liberal is a person who believes in the right of the individual to function the communist does not believe in the right of the individual they believe only in the right of the collective the individual is only part of a collective group and whenever he doesn t move according to the collective he is ousted from the group mr kuzig so you would say that when so called liberals today self denominated liberals support and work with the communist program they are being deluded into thinking they are helping a liberal cause when it is not liberal dodd jpegdodd one of the great tragedies today is that these americans do not realize that this would take civilization back to a barbarism which existed long before the christian era the communists have a way of changing names and labels how shall we recognize them then by the fact that they believe that there is no god that a person is just born grows dies decays and that is the end they believe that the individual doesn t matter that the collective matters they believe that certain people should have the power to run a country the protocols of zion emigrate while you still can learn more the protocols of zion make it clear that the illuminati bankers promoted liberalism and equality only to overthrow the gentile aristocracy and church while preaching liberalism to the goy we at the same time keep our own people and our agents in a state of unquestioning submission 15 in order to annihilate the institutions of the goyim we have replaced their mechanism by the chaotic license of liberalism we have got our hands into the administration of the law into the conduct of elections into the press into liberty of the person but principally into education and training as being the cornerstones of a free existence 9 their control is based on the paralysis they induce in representative government we replaced the ruler with a caricature of a government by a president taken from the mob from the midst of our puppet creatures or slaves this was the foundation of the mine which we have laid under the goy peoples 10 harry waton quote 1 jpgthrough their control of the press and education they lionized sedition mongers which in turn has protected them this advertisement has increased the contingent of liberals and has brought thousands of goyim into the ranks of our livestock cattle 19 as for equality the founders of communism write far back in ancient times we were the first to cry among the masses of the people the words liberty equality fraternity baits which carried away the well being of the world true freedom of the individual formerly so well guarded against the pressure of the mob the would be wise men of the goyim the intellectuals did not see that in nature there is no equality there can not be freedom that nature herself has established inequality of minds of characters and capacities it was based upon these things that dynastic rule rested the father passed on to the son a knowledge of the course of political affairs in such wise that none should know it but members of the dynasty and none could betray it to the governed as time went on the meaning of the dynastic transference of the true position of affairs in the political

revolution the rothschild mansion was spared by the rioting masses the bolsheviks were instructed to appropriate russian factories and hand them over to the bankers we are all liberals in the classical sense of believing in individual freedom but the illuminati bankers have changed the definition of liberal to the spurious notion of championing the underdog this has been used to divert

subset of cases such as the department of education raid on anthony wright s home police conduct a search of a building where the suspect no longer resides swat teams have even on occasion conducted multiple sequential raids on wrong addresses or executed search warrants despite the fact that the suspect is already in police custody police have also raided homes on the basis of mistaking the presence or scent of legal substances for drugs incredibly these substances have included tomatoes sunflowers fish elderberry bushes kenaf plants hibiscus and ragweed as you can see all too often botched swat team raids have resulted in one tragedy after another for the residents with little consequences for law enforcement unfortunately judges tend to afford extreme levels of deference to police officers who have mistakenly killed innocent civilians but do not afford similar leniency to civilians who have injured police officers in acts of self defense even homeowners who mistake officers for robbers can be sentenced for assault or murder if they take defensive actions resulting in harm to police and as journalist radley balko shows in his in depth study of police militarization the shock and awe tactics utilized by many swat teams only increases the likelihood that someone will get hurt drug warrants for instance are typically served by paramilitary units late at night or shortly before dawn unfortunately to the unsuspecting homeowner especially in cases involving mistaken identities or wrong addresses a raid can appear to be nothing less than a violent home invasion with armed intruders crashing through their door the natural reaction would be to engage in self defense yet such a defensive reaction on the part of a homeowner particularly a gun owner will spur officers to employ lethal force that s exactly what happened to jose guerena the young ex marine who was killed after a swat team kicked open the door of his arizona home during a drug raid and opened fire according to news reports guerena 26 years old and the father of two young children grabbed a gun in response to the forced invasion but never fired in fact the safety was still on his gun when he was killed police officers were not as restrained the young iraqi war veteran was allegedly fired upon 71 times guerena had no prior criminal record and the police found nothing illegal in his home the problems inherent in these situations are further compounded by the fact that swat teams are granted no knock warrants at high rates such that the warrants themselves are rendered practically meaningless this sorry state of affairs is made even worse by u s supreme court rulings that have essentiallydone away with the need for a no knock warrant altogether giving the police authority to disregard the protections afforded american citizens by the fourth amendment in the process americans are rendered altogether helpless and terror stricken as a result of these confrontations with the police indeed terrorizing is a mild term to describe the effect on those who survive such vigilante tactics it was terrible it was the most frightening experience of my life i thought it was a terrorist attack said 84 year old leona goldberg a victim of such a raid yet this type of terrorizing activity is characteristic of the culture that we have created if ever there were a time to de militarize and de weaponize local police forces it s now while we are now grappling with a power hungry police state at the federal level the militarization of domestic american law enforcement is largely the result of the militarization of local police forces which are increasingly militaristic in their uniforms weaponry language training and tactics and have come to rely on swat teams in matters that once could have been satisfactorily performed by traditional civilian officers yet american police forces were never supposed to be a branch of the military nor were they meant to be private security forces for the reigning political faction instead they were intended to be an aggregation of countless local police units composed of citizens like you and me that exist for a sole purpose to serve and protect the citizens of each and every american community as a result of the increasing militarization of the police in recent years however the police now not only look like the military with their foreboding uniforms and phalanx of lethal weapons but they function like them as well thus no more do we have a civilian force of peace officers entrusted with serving and protecting the american people instead today s militarized law enforcement officials have shifted their allegiance from the citizenry to the state acting preemptively to ward off any possible challenges to the government s power unrestrained by the boundaries of the fourth amendment as journalist herman schwartz observed the fourth amendment was designed to stand between us and arbitrary governmental authority for all practical purposes that shield has been shattered leaving our liberty and personal integrity subject to the whim of every cop on the beat trooper on the highway and jail official armed police officers the end product of the government federal local and state and law enforcement agencies having merged have become a standing or permanent army composed of full time professional soldiers who do not disband yet these permanent armies are exactly what those who drafted the u s constitution and bill of rights feared as tools used by despotic governments to wage war against its citizens this phenomenon we are experiencing with the police is what philosopher abraham kaplan referred to as the law of the instrument which essentially says that to a hammer everything looks like a nail in the scenario that has been playing out in recent years we the citizenry have become the nails to be hammered by the government s henchmen a k a its guns for hire a k a its standing army a k a the nation s law enforcement agencies yet the tension inherent in most civilian police encounter these days can t be blamed exclusively on law enforcement s growing reliance on swat teams and donated military equipment it goes far deeper to a transformation in the way police view themselves and their line of duty specifically what we re dealing with today is a skewed shoot to kill mindset in which police trained to view themselves as warriors or soldiers in a war whether against drugs or terror or crime must get the bad guys i e anyone who is a potential target before the bad guys get them the result is a spike in the number of incidents in which police shoot first and ask questions later making matters worse when these officers who have long since ceased to be peace officers violate their oaths by bullying beating tasering shooting and killing their employers the taxpayers to whom they owe their allegiance they are rarely given more than a slap on the hands before resuming their patrols as i document in my book battlefield america the war on the american people this lawlessness on the part of law enforcement an unmistakable characteristic of a police state is made possible in large part by police unions which routinely oppose civilian review boards and resist the placement of names and badge numbers on officer uniforms police agencies that abide by the blue code of silence the quiet understanding among police that they should not implicate their colleagues for their crimes and misconduct prosecutors who treat police offenses with greater leniency than civilian offenses courts that sanction police wrongdoing in the name of security and legislatures that enhance the power reach and arsenal of the police and a citizenry that fails to hold its government accountable to the rule of law clearly it s time for a reality check for both the police and the citizens of this nation,Fake
new report details us public less safe under militarized police,a new study published by the proceedings of the national academy of sciences on august 20 reveals that the militarization of law enforcement in the united states does not make communities safer nor does it enhance officer safety study author jonathan mummolo conducted a statistical analysis on crime rates and officer safety data from maryland using an expired law in effect between 2010 2014 required that police agencies submit reports on how often they use swat teams a german bundeswehr soldier of the 122th infantry battalion swat special weapons and tactics teams are intended to be used in emergency service and specifically for hostage armed standoff and barricade situations in which heavily armed and armored troops assault an area after negotiations have broken down the study revealed that after controlling for variables such as local crime rates a 10 percent increase in the black population resulted in a 10 percent increase in the chance of that zip code being swatted by an emergency service response team but not routinely for the purpose for which they are intended find out more 27 537 given the concentration of deployments in communities of color where trust in law enforcement and government at large is already depressed the routine use of militarized police tactics by local agencies threatens to increase the historic tensions between marginalized groups and the state with no detectable public safety benefit mummolo wrote in his study while swat teams arguably remain a necessary tool for violent emergency situations restricting their use to those rare events may improve perceptions of police with little or no safety loss he noted the study found that an overwhelming 90 percent of swat deployments in maryland over five fiscal years were conducted to simply serve search warrants in the study no evidence came to light proving that a swat team decreases crime or enhances officer safety although the heavily militarized teams are often described as being integral tools to combat dangerous situations in addition mummola examined how the use of swat teams impacts the public perception of police in two surveys he showed volunteers stories about a police chief requesting a budget increase german chancellor angela merkel with binoculars volunteers received one out of four photos with the story one photo showed a group of officers in traditional blue uniforms while the other three photos depicted heavy militarization gear the control image featured five male traditionally uniformed officers e g blue uniforms brimmed caps and standard sidearms the low militarization conditions showed five male officers with riot gear and batons or with body armor and assault rifles the high militarization condition added an armored vehicle according to the study study results showed that people assumed that the locations where there were militarized cops had higher crime revealingly observers were also less trusting of police in those places the high militarization condition in the survey caused a statistically significant 2 2 point increase in the perceived level of crime in the vignette city and strikingly a 3 2 point drop in respondents desire for more police patrols in their own neighborhoods the study stated,Fake

and border protection officers have come under fire for subjecting female travelers including minors to random body searches that include strip searches while menstruating genital probing and forced pelvic exams x rays and intravenous drugs at area hospitals at a california gas station ice agents surrounded a man who was taking his pregnant wife to the hospital to deliver their baby demanding that he show identification having forgotten his documents at home in the rush to get to the hospital the husband offered to go get them refusing to allow him to do so ice agents handcuffed and arrested the man for not having an id with him leaving his wife to find her way alone to the hospital the father of five including the newborn has lived and worked in the u s for 12 years with his wife emigrate while you still can learn more these are not isolated incidents these cases are legion this is what a state of undeclared martial law looks like when you can be arrested tasered shot brutalized and in some cases killed merely for not complying with a government agent s order or not complying fast enough this isn t just happening in crime ridden inner cities it s happening all across the country america has been locked down this is what it s like to be a citizen of the american police state this is what it s like to be an enemy combatant in your own country this is what it feels like to be a conquered people this is what it feels like to be an occupied nation this is what it feels like to live in fear of armed men crashing through your door in the middle of the night or to be accused of doing something you never even knew was a crime or to be watched all the time your movements tracked your motives questioned this is what it feels like to have your homeland transformed into a battlefield mind you in a war zone there are no police only soldiers thus there is no more posse comitatus prohibiting the government from using the military in a law enforcement capacity not when the local police have for all intents and purposes already become the military in a war zone the soldiers shoot to kill as american police have now been trained to do whether the perceived threat is armed or unarmed no longer matters when police are authorized to shoot first and ask questions later in a war zone even the youngest members of the community learn at an early age to accept and fear the soldier in their midst thanks to funding from the government more schools are hiring armed police officers some equipped with semi automatic ar 15 rifles to secure their campuses in a war zone you have no rights when you are staring down the end of a police rifle there can be no free speech when you re being held at bay by a militarized weaponized mine resistant tank there can be no freedom of assembly when you re being surveilled with thermal imaging devices facial recognition software and full body scanners and the like there can be no privacy when you re charged with disorderly conduct simply for daring to question or photograph or document the injustices you see with the blessing of the courts no less there can be no freedom to petition the government for a redress of grievances and when you re a prisoner in your own town unable to move freely kept off the streets issued a curfew at night there can be no mistaking the prison walls closing in this is happening and will happen anywhere and everywhere else in this country where law enforcement officials are given carte blanche to do what they like when they like how they like with immunity from their superiors the legislatures and the courts you see what americans have failed to comprehend living as they do in a tv induced drug like haze of fabricated realities narcissistic denial and partisan politics is that we ve not only brought the military equipment used in iraq and afghanistan home to be used against the american people we ve also brought the very spirit of the war home we the people have now come full circle from being held captive by the british police state to being held captive by the american police state in between we have charted a course from revolutionaries fighting for our independence and a free people establishing a new nation to pioneers and explorers braving the wilderness and expanding into new territories where we went wrong however was in allowing ourselves to become enthralled with and then held hostage by a military empire in bondage to a corporate state the very definition of fascism no longer does america hold the moral high ground as a champion of freedom and human rights instead in the pursuit of profit our overlords have transformed the american landscape into a battlefield complete with military personnel tactics and weaponry to our dismay we now find ourselves scrambling for a foothold as our once rock solid constitutional foundation crumbles beneath us and no longer can we rely on the president congress the courts or the police to protect us from wrongdoing indeed the president congress the courts and the police have come to embody all that is wrong with america for instance how does a man who is relatively healthy when taken into custody by police lapse into a coma and die while under their supervision what kind of twisted logic allows a police officer to use a police car to run down an american citizen and justifies it in the name of permissible deadly force and what country are we living in where the police can beat shoot choke taser and tackle american citizens all with the protection of the courts certainly the constitution s safeguards against police abuse means nothing when government agents can crash through your door terrorize your children shoot your dogs and jail you on any number of trumped of charges and you have little say in the matter for instance san diego police responding to a domestic disturbance call on a sunday morning showed up at the wrong address

watch unarmed dad murdered by cops in front of his kids while trying to rescue a stray dog,for not having the proper driver s license when he tried to bring a stray dog to a shelter an innocent man was killed by police in front of his children license dothan al a 30 year old father robert earl lawrence was shot and killed by police in front of his own children after he attempted to do a good deed by turning a stray dog in at a local animal shelter the horrifying dash cam video showing this otherwise entirely innocent father s execution has just been released on dec 30 2014 lawrence and his three young children all under 10 years old found a stray dog in the parking lot of a walmart in dothan alabama after they put the dog in their car the family drove to the dothan animal shelter to attempt to save its life however instead of accepting this good deed and taking the animal in without question the workers at the shelter demanded that lawrence show them his government issued id find out more 27 689 instead of giving them his id lawrence showed them notarized and legal identification that was an affidavit instead of motor vehicle administration id card because he was a sovereign citizen after being told that he couldn t drop the dog without a state issued driver s license lawrence told the shelter that he would leave and bring the dog elsewhere however the shelter told lawrence that he couldn t leave the employees of the shelter including an officer on the scene then made a careless decision that would end the man s life it was not reported that lawrence was at all belligerent or violent with the employees of the shelter however the police were present because he did not have a form of id with which they were familiar as the dash cam shows when police arrive lawrence was being polite and cordial and complying with the officer s orders however it was the officer who grew belligerent and began making threats toward the father in front of his children as al com reports a dothan police officer stationed at the shelter followed him to his car and wouldn t let him leave without producing a license a couple months earlier according to his cousin lawrence had begun to read about sovereign citizens an anti government movement that often includes among other things complicated arguments against the constitutionality of driver s licenses in short lawrence was ready to argue having studied all the laws surrounding the sovereign citizen s movement lawrence attempted to plead his case for not having to produce a driver s license to the officer who wanted nothing of it several minutes later after multiple threats from the officer to lawrence the officer attempted to kidnap the man for trying to plead his case as to why he didn t think he required a driver s license remember lawrence had caused harm to no one he had not stolen anything broken any laws or otherwise done anything to warrant the presence of police he and his children were simply trying to rescue a dog as police tried to take lawrence into custody a struggle ensued as lawrence knowing he had caused no harm and hurt no one did not want to be kidnapped moments later as al com reports sgt adrianne woodruff reached her arm through a melee between the arms of two officers tugging at lawrence to press the barrel of her service weapon into in his gut and without warning or utterance pulled the trigger lawrence was unarmed and was not hitting or otherwise attempting to harm the officers he was simply defending himself by pulling away at one point as shown in the video as the officer was using the taser like a cattle prod on the innocent father lawrence grabbed his hand and tried to pull it away this pulling away of the taser was used to justify sgt woodruff in the murder of lawrence as they claimed he was an armed threat woodruff never received so much as a slap on the wrist for killing lawrence that day and has fought for immunity in a civil case now however a judge disagreed that woodruff is entitled to immunity and has ruled that a lawsuit can move forward it is undisputed that woodruff gave no warning before shooting lawrence wrote the magistrate last month a jury could conclude that lawrence did not pose a serious threat of harm to the officers to warrant the use of deadly force by woodruff for not having a driver s license to rescue a dog robert earl lawrence would be killed by police his children would watch with their own eyes as their father died in front of them at the hands of those they thought were there to protect them as the lawsuit moves forward it is highly likely that the taxpayers will be held liable for lawrence s death however no amount of money will ever fix the ptsd and anguish his children suffer from every single day as a result of woodruff pulling that trigger,Fake

police officers decked in camouflage and robocop style costumes riding in armored vehicles and carrying automatic weapons first introduced during the u s occupation of baghdad that it has become normalized the dangers of domestic militarization are both numerous and manifest to begin with it degrades the mentality of police forces in virtually every negative way and subjects their targeted

hartford sergeant shown on video saying hes trigger happy had been suspended in 2016 abuse incident,officials suspended sgt stephen barone friday after a video surfaced that shows him telling suspected trespassers that he is trigger happy if anybody wants to fight or run i m a little trigger happy guys i m not gon na lie and i get paid a ton of money in overtime if i have to shoot somebody so don t do anything stupid barone is heard telling the group on heath street thursday night in a three minute clip posted on facebook friday barone a 10 year veteran identified in the video by police officials friday was among several officers suspended in an investigation into a 2016 car chase in which then sgt sean spell kicked a man while he was handcuffed barone was later promoted to sergeant the video shows the suspects remained calm during the interaction but one is heard describing the sergeant s statement about being trigger happy as spooky there s four of you one of me alright barone then told the group find out more 28 666 it appears that during the conversation at least one other police car arrived at the scene hartford police assistant chief rafael medina said in an email to community leaders that police are still reviewing the nature of the interaction barone had with the group but said he has been placed on leave and internal affairs has started an investigation regardless of the context or the intent those statements are entirely unacceptable and represent a fundamental disregard for the conduct we expect and the standards we hold ourselves to medina said we look at it from the perspective of the person on the other end of the field interview and to hear those words isn t just scary it projects an image of law enforcement officers who take use of force lightly as i hope you know we do not take any use of force lightly as a department stephen barone sgt stephen barone second from left was placed on leave after a video surfaced in which he was heard saying he was trigger happy officials said one of the people said they were approached by the police at about 9 30 p m she said they were near an abandoned house that her boyfriend is considering buying given it s near to a store he runs the individual said they were all given a ticket for trespassing after they were searched by officers she said no contraband was found mayor luke bronin condemned the actions by the officer the behavior in this video is completely unacceptable it s inconsistent with the values of our police department and our city and it is deeply damaging and disappointing law enforcement officers have a responsibility to treat the use of force and threats of force seriously at all times bronin said bronin does not plan to call for an independent investigation but will rely on the findings of the department s internal affairs division the president of the hartford police union did not immediately return a call for comment during the video the sergeant voiced concerns that the group was hanging out near a vacant home he asked anyone if they had any weapons drugs or any warrants he also asked the group for identification when he asks the individual holding the camera the video stops barone was assigned in may as the ranking officer in the police department s community response unit an initiative under the new chief that is tasked with engaging in proactive problem resolution for quality of life issues that impact residents visitors and those who conduct business within the city medina said the department is reviewing the unit and its role following barone s suspension hartford cops disciplined in west hartford arrest probe promoted barone prior to his promotion to sergeant was one of several officers disciplined for violating department standards during a police chase in june 2016 that turned physical when then sgt sean spell kicked a man emilio diaz while he was handcuffed on the ground he was suspended for four days following a lengthy internal affairs investigation into what transpired that night investigators learned that at several times barone improperly stopped the camera in his cruiser including when he first tried to stop the car and when the chase ended on flatbush avenue in west hartford during an interview investigators said that barone provided excuses according to the expansive report barone at one point said it was muscle memory he also said he manually shut the camera off follwing the chase and during the struggle with diaz and ricardo perez the two men in the car because he didn t think it was relevant to record the interaction he denied that he turned it off so it wouldn t capture efforts to take the men into custody the report read given that the camera was shut off investigators from the state s attorney s office were concerned that the video was physically tampered with and had hard drives from the cruiser cameras sent for forensic testing hartford police unit formed to crack down on quality of life issues despite this barone and a detective who was also involved were both promoted to sergeant in september of last year police officials at the time said they had previously been passed up for promotions at the time because of this incident hartford city council president glendowlyn thames said she was disturbed and disappointed by what she saw on the video it s extremely troubling just based off the video not knowing the full context it s very troubling to see one of our police officers interacting with our citizens in that way it s not acceptable behavior it s not the model we re trying to build as i understand it the police department has taken swift action to put him on administrative leave she said she said the officer s language was unacceptable in a scathing response to the video the aclu of connecticut echoed statements by others that the actions were unacceptable while calling into question the quality of life policing initiative this video confirms that hartford s emphasis on quality of life policing is not an investment in stronger communities but in over policing and under protecting some city residents as long as hartford s executive branch and police department continue to condone policing without checks and balances created by and for the people this kind of unacceptable behavior will be a feature of the police department not a bug said executive director david mcguire medina said incidents like the one thursday night do not reflect what the department strives to be in the community we are committed to true community policing and true community partnership and in this case that means being fully transparent and direct about this incident medina said,Fake
nypd officer uses illegal chokehold two tasers on new yorker in response to a noise complaint from,still showing medina being restrained by police an nypd detective who has been sued multiple times for using excessive force allegedly placed an inwood man in a chokehold and then shot him with a taser gun last month while responding to a noise complaint according to a criminal complaint 33 year old tomas medina was outside a car dealership at 438 west 206th street around midnight on july 14th when detective fabio nunez and officer shanee pierce responded to a complaint of loud music they told me the neighbors complained about the music medina told the daily news which first reported the story i told him i was already picking everything up to go find out more 28 782 at around the 11 39 mark in the video below which was provided by medina s attorneys at the legal aid society detective nunez approaches medina from behind grabs him by the neck and pushes him into the side of a car as medina appears to resist and protest his treatment detective nunez appears to put medina in a chokehold which are explicitly prohibited by the nypd patrol guide later the detective seems to draw his taser gun and shoot medina shocking him the two exit the frame as bystanders gather and record the encounter and uniformed nypd officers swarm the scene he just started choking me i couldn t breathe

complaint against him alleges that detective nunez was attempting to place medina under arrest for disorderly conduct relating to playing music at an excessive volume and that medina bit the detective s finger and hit officer pierce in the eye court documents show that the city has paid out more than 250 000 in five separate settlements since 2005 related to detective nunez s conduct one case involved hitting a man with a baton another involved a broken arm another involved a home invasion the manhattan da s office which is prosecuting the case against medina sent a letter to legal aid attorneys this year stating that detective nunez may have lied under oath in 2009 that case involved detective nunez pulling over a livery cab and chasing and arresting its passenger for drug possession according to the letter detective nunez claimed that he had never spoken to the cab driver before the arrest occurred and that he pulled the car over because it had its robbery light on but the driver would testify that he never engaged his robbery light and that nunez pulled up to him earlier that evening to ask questions about his fare the da s office declined to charge nunez for lying detective nunez who has been a police officer for 18 years is currently listed as a neighborhood coordination officer for the 34th precinct medina s arrest occurred one day after the nypd decided to move forward with departmental charges against officer daniel pantaleo who was involved in the fatal choking of staten island man eric garner in 2014 cynthia conti cook a staff attorney with legal aid s criminal special litigation unit and one of medina s attorneys told gothamist that there have been at least 48 chokehold allegations against the nypd in federal court since garner s death costing the city more than a half a million dollars in settlements even though it rose to everyone s attention in 2014 as a prohibited use of force it still hasn t stopped being used by officers and it has been named in multiple allegations in lawsuits since conti cook said she added that the fact that detective nunez is supposed to be part of mayor bill de blasio s community policing initiative substantiates what we ve been hearing from traditionally targeted communities about neighborhood policing it isn t all basketball games and block parties many of the patterns of abusive policing still

news database of leaked records did not yield any results a spokesperson for manhattan da cy vance jr declined to comment because the case is still pending after garner s death a 2015 report by the new york city department of investigation and the nypd s inspector general s office found that the nypd s disciplinary process related to chokeholds yielded inconsistent results and recommended that the department work more closely with the civilian complaint review board and that officers undergo de escalation retraining the nypd responded to that report with a letter stating that eventually all 35 000 uniformed officers would receive the three day training every year just last week the ccrb released a memo flatly stating that if a chokehold is substantiated in a case they would recommend disciplinary action a spokesman for the police department did not respond to our request for comment we ll update if they do medina s next court date is september 13,Fake
where they burn books they will soon burn people,fact president trump is sitting in the white house today largely because of the independent media find out more 28 858 fact president trump just thumbed his nose to one of his biggest supporters alex jones when he refused to use the power of the president to reign in the illegal behaviors of the social media monopolies fact one time staunch supporter of trump gary heavin retired owner of curves philanthropist and movie producer stated on the common sense show that he no longer supports trump and that he is clearly compromised in the interview i was shocked but i could not deny his supporting evidence i desperately wanted gary to be wrong sadly everything he said was true is it time to forsake trump am i jumping off of the trump train no i am not i am being pushed of off the train by his explainable inaction in moving to protect the only media that has been friendly to the president there is no denying the many great economic accomplishments of the trump administration however and for the time being he has clearly deserted his base this is my line in the sand for donald trump if trump does not move to undo the illegal censorship of the social media giants it is time for the independent media to re evaluate where we will place our efforts the social media giants are low hanging fruit they are in such blatant violation of federal law that prosecuting them is easy again under the open forum laws that all social media giants claim membership status in they are not allowed to discriminate and censor ted cruz exposed the open forum umbrella that all the social media giants are operating under further there is no question that the social media giants are monopolies in fact they are poster children for this concept however monopolies can not selectively censor without being in violation of anti trust laws again where is trump emigrate while you still can learn more where will you go for the only true version of the news you are on this website because you know you can not trust cnn abc msnbc the washington post etc by election day of 2018 you will not have many places to go to find out what s really going on the following entities are actively censoring and banning the independent media the country of new zealand for canceling the planned appearances of lauren southern google which should now be considered the face of the new world order twitter facebook snap chat instagram all of the msm print radio and tv patreon any and every form of social media a man who i suspect was an ai troll sent me an email i want to share hodges you and your kind are an absolute joke you poor bastards in the alt right media deserve to go out of business i am so happy that alex jones otherwise known as bill hicks is going out of business your sorry ass is next you are lucky that we don t kill all of you and your families so you can not reproduce your kind very soon you poor bastard you will have nowhere to go to spread your christian bs that will indeed be a good day when you are shipped off to a fema camp i get emails like this all the time but this one is important because it captures what many liberals are feeling in the present moment the goal of censorship as i previously said i used to be marginalized by being labeled a conspiracy theorist after several decades of employing that strategy it no longer works the globalists are attempting to permanently silence the independent media once and for all in the election of 2016 they made a mistake and it cost hillary the election they are determined that our influence on the upcoming mid term elections is negated heed my next words the globalists have made another miscalculation even if every alt right media source was effectively censored the blue wave coming from the democrats will fail the damage has been done what s coming the answer to that question is another question in response blue dawn red dawn and the destruction of america is on the table there is no hiding the agenda of the globalists many journalists are predicting widespread violence between now and the november election trump will be either a hillary clone at this point or he will just fade away and become another new world order puppet or he can take some political viagra and act accordingly trump could still act but i am not holding my breath he needs us now in the midterm elections any by october many of us are going to be mia donald trump jr did talk about censorship yesterday but he s not his father what s next for the media one must ask if trump continues to desert those that brought him to power what lies next will the american people have anywhere to go to learn the truth about what is happening the answer is yes because nature hates a vacuum unless trump acts decisively and soon there will be significant changes you will not see any of us on facebook twitter instagram youtube etc the independent media im will change form the subscription model put forth by john b wells will very likely be repeated with the revenues from youtube facebook etc drying up we will see the im move to subscription services at first the public who are used to getting a free lunch 80 will yell and scream at having to pay a subscription however after watching a week of cnn they will return and pay a nominal subscription fee what you will see in the future if this censorship trend continues are nothing but websites and radio shows generated from those websites however the im will have to be on a platform that they can not be removed from such as godaddy i have already positioned myself in this manner and my radio show is not hosted by anyone that can be pressured in the final analysis we are witnessing the great american book burning today s libraries are housed on the internet the alex jones wing of the library was burned down in this latest purge and what is that saying where they burn books they will soon burn people we are no living under the american version of maoism what did mao do to the chinese people after the books were all burned and all information was controlled he murdered 60 million of his own people this book burning is a precursor to a maoist style genocide look at george soros the man who betrayed his fellow jews to the nazi and tell me that it can not happen here the purge is already underway please subscribe to our youtube channel and don t forget to like us major announcement stay tuned dave has accepted an offer from a major podcast company to broadcast his daily interviews and

montgomery county courthouse in norristown pa tuesday june 6 2017 a source who can only be identified as a neutral montgomery county court official claims a tape played in court which helped convict bill cosby was either doctored or partly erased and the original recording contained information that would exonerate the comedian no one in the media no one on the defense really have either asked me or pressed me or to my knowledge anyone else about the tape said the individual who has requested anonymity because identification could lead to employment loss and other sanctions find out more 94 657 the recording in question aired during cosby s trial in april 2018 before a jury found him guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault for providing benadryl tablets to former temple university employee andrea constand and then engaging in foreplay where he touched her under her pants and she touched his penis what did you give my daughter i know my daughter gianna constand andrea s mother said in a decades old conversation with cosby however a source said what s been omitted from the tape could prove cosby s innocence what s not on the tape are two things it was not what s been reported that this is some angry person the source said she said look bill i know my daughter and something is wrong with my daughter bill i have to tell you something what did you give my daughter emigrate while you still can learn more while that might sound consistent to the recording played inside the montgomery county courthouse in pennsylvania the source said here s where the change or omission occurred mr cosby said to her asked her point blank are you accusing me of date rape mr cosby was incredulous because he knew and gianna knew that he and andrea s relationship was consensual the source said gianna constand continued according to the source she said no she wasn t accusing him of date rape but then you get to see her real motivation which was money because she said to him bill things are tough i don t know how i m going to make it and this is a married woman saying this so mr cosby just goes on to apologize for having the relationship with her daughter and she told him that his apology was enough and that she didn t want anything else when cosby overheard a noise on the phone he asked constand whether he was being recorded and she denied she was recording saying that the sound was her pet parrot testimony revealed that even while constand surreptitiously recorded cosby she had already first searched for a civil lawyer and then called police they ran out of money and this was a way of them getting money and gianna constand hated blacks said robert russell a former friend of the constand family whose potential bombshell testimony was not allowed by judge steven t o neill russell said he was prepared to testify that andrea constand at her mother s direction plotted to extort cosby who eventually settled a civil suit with constand for 3 4 million throughout the trial those not in the courtroom were provided the mainstream media s version of the tape which many neutral observers said included so much bias that they believed the media worked in concert with prosecutors to convict cosby and decimate his legacy for instance it was widely reported in headlines and leads that cosby admits to being a dirty old man however the tape clearly reveals cosby saying i don t want you to think that i m a dirty old man famed forensic psychiatrist carole lieberman who has years of experience in hundreds of civil and criminal trials said it s appalling to discover after cosby s conviction that gianna constand may have doctored or left out parts of the recording that could have changed the face of the trial to be honest i always suspected that there was something off with his accuser and her story the defense obviously did not do a good enough job for cosby despite the hundreds of thousands they were paid lieberman said they should have sent this tape to a forensic analyst who would have been able to tell that it was doctored this is done on a routine basis in cases where tapes are involved she said lieberman said even though cosby is set to be sentenced on sept 25 it s still not too late to right the wrong first the court should order that the tape be analyzed if it is doctored then a mistrial should be declared and his conviction should be thrown out lieberman said the prosecutors should be reprimanded and the defense attorneys should return the fees cosby paid them otherwise they should be sued for malpractice if his conviction isn t thrown out he can appeal on the basis of ineffective representation by counsel she said,Fake

art and museums in philadelphia part 1,last month eric and i went to philadelphia to immerse ourselves in our country s history i was lucky enough to get the chance to work with visit philly to get ourselves to all of the city s awesome landmark attractions i want to start by talking about all the amazing art in philly philadelphia is home to some of my bucketlist travel items and of course those things were on the top of my itinerary let s talk about the one place i ve been wanting to visit for probably two decades the m tter museum i am such a sucker for medical mysteries weird medical things and how the human body is so different when it comes to different people unfortunately i was not able to take any photos inside the actual exhibit part of the m tter museum because there are still people on display that have living relatives that come to visit them and it is for their privacy i did ask one of the security guards how many people got busted for trying to take pictures everyday and was told that at 11am they already caught two i m not a rule breaker even for my blog so i ll just explain some of the awesome stuff they had the m tter giant as he s called can t be contained in one photo the m tter museum is part of the college of physicians of philadelphia has the tallest human skeleton displayed in north america in their museum he s 7 6 and is displayed with one of the smallest female skeletons a woman who had dwarfism and was a prostitute who then got pregnant and couldn t naturally deliver her baby doctors tried to save her by sacrificing the baby but didn t succeed so both died it makes me so happy for our medical strides because i m sure this was not a rare occurrence in the past the museum also has a cast of chang and eng conjoined twins who were made famous by robert ripley of ripley s believe it or not and were their own manager when they worked in the circus the liver that they shared is on display as well as one of their chairs that was saved when the hospital before it became a museum did the the autopsy seeing this i wonder if they were born 100 years later if they couldn t have been separated and led their own lives look at these ear bones i was allowed to take pics of these in the lobby there is a whole wall of skulls from people who died in a variety of ways this crazy enlarged colon things people have swallowed extremities with gangrene tumors and so much more i was fascinated and horrified and then fascinated again you can view how medical practices have changed so much over the years and it s brilliant we also happened to visit on world polio day which seemed very fitting there are rotating exhibits so even if you ve been before there will be something you haven t seen and i doubt you ll not be able to find something you missed on your previous visit s there are so many museums in the city but the largest and most prominent is the philadelphia museum of art inside you ll find several floors of labyrinthine rooms not only can you run up the rocky steps there are so many but on the last wednesday of the month they have pay what you want after 5pm it s the only day it s open late if you love all kinds of art this is the place for you but give yourself 3 or more hours we visited the featured exhibit which was women s fashion throughout history can you tell the difference between the 80s and the 50s or the 70s and 90s in some cases the accessories totally made it work there is so much art to see plus on the night we visited they were also having oktoberfest in the lobby and a trick or treat scavenger hunt for kids so there were tons of littles in costumes which was almost as fun as the art you ll find room after room full of artwork of all sorts from paintings to sculptures to glasswork make certain to wear your walking shoes if only for the thousand steps you ll need to navigate just to get to the front door you ll find modern art contemporary impressionism surrealism and everything else you can think of from diego rivera to picasso to monet to manet there s almost no great artist left out but i ll leave you with my favorite piece done in bronze by cecioni which i entitled me when i meet a puppy i have no idea what s happening in this piece but i found it hysterical i m not sure if everyone s happy or no one is happy but it made me happy and i feel like that s what i want out of art this angle is deceiving there are these steps probably 5 sets of 20 and then another set at the top past a courtyard as i said you can run up the many many many steps and do your rocky pose or you can drag yourself up the stairs wonder how you ve only made it halfway up and debate rolling back down to find an elevator we encouraged each other to the top saying that if the two year old we passed could make it up 10 steps that were half her height we could make it the rest of the way up you can also get your pic taken with a statue of sylvester stallone as rocky at the bottom of the steps in the front of the museum every time we passed by there was a long line but as we were leaving the museum in the evening there weren t any people waiting not shocking since it was dark out so i made eric take my picture i m sorry i didn t do a yo adrian pose this is all i could muster this isn t the end of philadelphia s art but i feel like it s enough for one part of a post and i ll continue with it in the next post i could easily have filled two posts with just finds from the pmoa it s much more fun to explore for yourself though where is your favorite museum,Fake

seriously big win for someone after all isn t it most people s dream to put their last coin into a slots machine and see the jackpot come pouring out or to pick their lucky number of the roulette wheel and see it come in here are seven stories of victories that have come against all the odds sean connery most famous as the quintessential james bond sean connery has become synonymous with smooth sophistication later in his career as well as being a natural inhabitant of the casino but connery has proved himself as an accomplished gambler all his life one night in a casino in the italian alps back in 1963 connery was playing roulette he placed a bet on 17 black it failed so he repeated it and lost again undeterred he bet once again on the same number this time it came in rather than taking his winnings and calling it a night he put them all on exactly the same number not once but twice and won both times the result an actor who was suddenly richer by 17 million lire or around 230 000 at today s rates archie karas when archie karas arrived in las vegas in 1992 he had just 50 in his pockets having recently lost 2million in a poker game in los angeles his first stroke of luck was running into a friend who lent him 10 000 to buy into a game of razz a poker variant in which the lowest hand wins over the next three years he managed to amass a fortune of around 40million through a combination of poker playing and pool hustling but his luck wasn t destined to last in a terrible run of bad fortune he lost it all at craps baccarat and poker but he wasn t a man to be kept down within three weeks he d already managed to win back 1million having borrowed 40 000 to set him on his way patricia demauro someone who had rather better luck at craps was patricia demauro on 23rd may 2009 she had what must be one of the best ever examples of beginner s luck demauro a grandmother from new jersey visited the borgata casino in new jersey and played craps for only the second time in her life starting out with 100 she proceeded to convert it into hundreds of thousands of dollars by making 154 successive winning throws over 4 hours and 18 minutes the odds of this happening were an estimated 1 in 1 56 trillion and even she admits that she didn t really understand what was happening demauro absolutely smashed the previous record of 147 successive winning dice throws held by a player known only as the captain quite how demauro came to hold the craps world bet is one of gambling s most remarkable stories and it makes for incredible reading don johnson 2011 was a tough time for casinos in the us with revenues falling thanks to the global economic slump so many were desperate to attract high rollers in the hope of generating extra income one blackjack player don johnson negotiated special terms in exchange for his custom especially an agreed payback of 20 of his losses so even if he dropped 100 000 in a session he d still get 20 000 of it back this along with other concessions he d negotiated to alter the standard rules of the game meant that within three months he d made a cool 15million johnson now claims he s not welcome in many casinos but with that much cash in the bank he may not be particularly bothered about this ashley revell ashley revell is remarkable not for the amount that he won at the casino but the way in which he won it one day he was with friends in his home city of london when they were discussing what a blast it could be to bet all of your possessions on the spin of a roulette wheel so that s what he decided he would do selling everything off and heading for las vegas with 115 000 in his pocket he was put up in some style by the plaza hotel and casino who saw it as a great publicity stunt ashley was planning to put everything on black but family and followers persuaded him to switch to red this proved to be a good move as unbelievably it came up and he headed home with 220 000 to his name amy nishimura when amy nishimura headed off to las vegas for a christmas break in 2003 there was no way that she could have anticipated the present she was due to receive on the very first day of her holiday she put 100 in credit into a slots machine called megabucks 60 later she was looking at a jackpot of 8 919 598 at odds of over 1 6 million to 1 although amy had been playing the slots since the 1980s she d never dreamt she d ever win such a life changing amount of money in fact when she was asked how she planned to spend it she was simply lost for words elmer sherwin our final casino winner was also left speechless when he too won a big slots jackpot one day in 2005 when he was visiting the cannery casino hotel in las vegas the 92 year old ww2 veteran felt that a megabucks machine was due to pay out it turns out he was right and he picked up a 21 147 947 jackpot part of which he donated to the hurricane katrina relief fund but what makes the story really incredible is the fact that in 1989 he had already won 4 6 million from a slot in the newly opened mirage on the las vegas strip proof as if it were ever needed that lightning really can strike twice,Fake

limiting social media use reduced loneliness and depression in new experiment devin coldewey techcrunch 16 hours ago,the idea that social media can be harmful to our mental and emotional well being is not a new one but little has been done by researchers to directly measure the effect surveys and correlative studies are at best suggestive a new experimental study out of penn state however directly links more social media use to worse emotional states and less use to better to be clear on the terminology here a simple survey might ask people to self report that using instagram makes them feel bad a correlative study would for example find that people who report more social media use are more likely to also experience depression an experimental study compares the results from an experimental group with their behavior systematically modified and a control group that s allowed to do whatever they want this study led by melissa hunt at penn state s psychology department is the latter which despite intense interest in this field and phenomenon is quite rare the researchers only identified two other experimental studies both of which only addressed facebook use one hundred and forty three students from the school were monitored for three weeks after being assigned to either limit their social media use to about 10 minutes per app facebook snapchat and instagram per day or continue using it as they normally would they were monitored for a baseline before the experimental period and assessed weekly on a variety of standard tests for depression social support and so on social media usage was monitored via the ios battery use screen which shows app use the results are clear as the paper published in the latest journal of social and clinical psychology puts it the limited use group showed significant reductions in loneliness and depression over three weeks compared to the control group both groups showed significant decreases in anxiety and fear of missing out over baseline suggesting a benefit of increased self monitoring our findings strongly suggest that limiting social media use to approximately 30 minutes per day may lead to significant improvement in well being it s not the final word in this however some scores did not see improvement such as self esteem and social support and later follow ups to see if feelings reverted or habit changes were less than temporary were limited because most of the subjects couldn t be compelled to return psychology often summarized as the study of undergraduates relies on student volunteers who have no reason to take part except for course credit and once that s given they re out that said it s a straightforward causal link between limiting social media use and improving some aspects of emotional and social health the exact nature of the link however is something at which hunt could only speculate some of the existing literature on social media suggests there s an enormous amount of social comparison that happens when you look at other people s lives particularly on instagram it s easy to conclude that everyone else s life is cooler or better than yours when you re not busy getting sucked into clickbait social media you re actually spending more time on things that are more likely to make you feel better about your life the researchers acknowledge the limited nature of their study and suggest numerous directions for colleagues in the field to take it from here a more diverse population for instance or including more social media platforms longer experimental times and comprehensive follow ups well after the experiment would help as well the 30 minute limit was chosen as a conveniently measurable one but the team does not intend to say that it is by any means the correct amount perhaps half or twice as much time would yield similar or even better results they suggest it may be that there is an optimal level of use similar to a dose response curve that could be determined until then we can use common sense hunt suggested in general i would say put your phone down and be with the people in your life,Real

5 things to avoid in pubg,pubg or playerunknown s battlegrounds has become somewhat of a cult in the short span of almost two years of its existence and it is one of the most intense actions games out there with solo as well as team fights that culminate in multiple people battling at the same time while there are no hard and fast rules about what is considered good practice and bad there are some set of unofficial facts that make it easier for the players to get that coveted chicken dinner so we are going to list out a few tips that are considered as effective measures in getting kills being noticed less and winning matches in pubg going unnoticed pubg offers a lot of cosmetic options in the game that are colorful to say the least and though these might look look on the characters it is not advisable to wear them in matches this is because colorful outfits stick out in the terrain and make you easier to spot for the enemies so try and stick to clothes that make you less visible in the game using single shot and burst fire let s admit it using the auto mode for firing is great at close range but it is ineffective in longer ranges and makes you miss the target so when firing over longer distances always try to use burst or single fire mode but those that have mastered controlling the spray can use it over longer ranges being silent pubg is a game where sound is used by players to detect other players so it only makes sense that the players themselves make less sound to give fewer hints to the enemy fire only when you have the full enemy team in sight and always be careful to watch the back in case other teams hear you and come to take part in the fight this becomes crucial at the final few circles of the game microsoft has made pubg and pro evolution soccer 2019 free on xbox one also read microsoft has made pubg and pro evolution soccer 2019 free on xbox one avoiding vehicles avoiding vehicles in pubg is a good idea since they make you a more silent target and a smaller one it does not take much for a team of four players to destroy a vehicle which makes them death machines sure they have their uses in covering those long distances but sometimes it is just not worth it sanhok is one map where vehicles should be positively avoided since it is extremely small and the likelihood of running into enemies is much more being careful with care packages care packages come with some great loot but they are also shining beacon for other teams as well and it more than so happens that more than one teams try to get the same care package and whichever team happens to reach it first becomes an active target for the other enemies to fire upon hence caution is always good when dealing with care packages the ideal play is to wait and pick off any team that tries to get the care package first and then going for it when the coast it clear watch pubg beryl m762 all you need to know,Real

windies seek small joys as chastening tour draws to a close,that windies are returning home empty handed from this full fledged tour of india has been established therefore it wasnt a complete surprise when the caribbean test specialists turned up at chepauk for some red ball practice even before the current t20i squad began their drills ahead of chennai dead rubber barring opening spells that have grabbed eyeballs nothing has gone windies way even in the shortest format on this tour they ran into dinesh karthik version 2 0 in the series opener to concede the game despite having reduced india to 45 4 in a chase of 110 then in lucknow a vintage rohit sharma show virtually rendered the contest over before windies could begin their chase the lack of contributions from the experienced quartet of carlos brathwaite kieron pollard denesh ramdin and darren bravo has been at the heart of their batting meltdowns the windies are also without specialist openers in the wake of chris gayle and evin lewis withdrawing from the series and have had to make do with those at their disposal they went in with the pair who had reasonable success in the preceding odis shai hope and shimron hetmyer but only managed marginally better returns than from the hope ramdin combo the instability of the batting order is glaring while skipper brathwaite isnt too fussed about the criticism that comes with this hit and trial theory he also didnt mince his words in putting the blame squarely on the batsmen for not applying themselves enough the captain also took the responsibility for their insipid bowling show in game 2 that allowed india to race away to a near 200 run total brathwaite and khary pierre came in the firing line leaking 105 runs between them in their eight overs alone the bowling overall has been guilty of failing to sustain the pressure even though pacer oshane thomas and all rounder fabian allen have offered a glimpse into the potential of this young squad however windies would need more than just intermittent sparks to avoid the embarrassment of a whitewash on an extended diwali break since the series clinching 71 run win in lucknow the indians have released three usual suspects kuldeep yadav jasprit bumrah and umesh yadav from their squad with an eye on the upcoming tour of australia that also begins with t20is as such the inconsequential final

brazilian grand prix reliving lewis hamiltons first world title 10 years on,cnn ten years ago on a rain soaked afternoon in s o paulo lewis hamilton claimed the first of his five world titles to become the youngest formula one champion in history in 2008 the brazilian grand prix was the 18th and final race of the season and in theory should have been a victory procession for the briton who needed only to finish fifth it turned out to be anything but and is now remembered as an enthralling nail biting title decider play video lewis hamilton reflects on first world title 02 52 i just got a chill up my spine because it was an amazing experience hamilton later told cnn as he reflected on that first title win a late tropical deluge delayed the start of the race and set the scene for an outcome so dramatic even hollywoods best script writers would have struggled to imagine it from last lap drama to internet conspiracy theories it was the race that produced everything unquestionably the most dramatic of hamiltons wins he didnt know he was world champion until the last quarter of a mile f1 author maurice hamilton tells cnn it was arguably one of the most dramatic finales to any world championship i can never remember one as dramatic as that up until the last lap you didnt know which way it was going to go its in the top two or three of the most amazing grands prix ive seen read meet the next generation of f1 stars read the british teenager set to make f1 history d j vu hamilton boasted a seven point lead over ferraris felipe massa heading into the race at interlagos but memories of the previous years capitulation were very much still at the forefront of his mind just 12 months earlier hamilton again led the drivers championship going into the final race four points ahead of mclaren teammate fernando alonso and seven ahead of ferraris kimi raikkonen after the mclaren pair almost took each other out on lap one hamilton went on to suffer car problems and the iceman was able to snatch the title in his first season at ferrari the events in 2007 made him lewis very nervous no question said maurice hamilton they should have won that championship and because hamilton and alonso were at each others throats they finished joint second and kimi came through the middle and took it the team were very nervous im sure it would have been playing on his mind he did admit on the last lap he was a complete bag of nerves and driving on adrenaline two torrential downpours tested the drivers to their limits two torrential downpours tested the drivers to their limits in 2008 massa qualified on pole with hamilton fourth and the opening 63 laps passed largely without incident for the two main protagonists as the skies cleared and the track dried every driver in the field switched to dry tires hamilton bounced between fourth and fifth both positions good enough to win him the title while a faultless massa led throughout just as it was looking like hamilton would cruise through the final eight laps black rainclouds again began to loom menacingly overhead the rain was light at first little more than a few spots but just two laps later it was coming down hard enough to convince mclaren that hamilton needed to pit for the wet weather tires by lap 66 every car had pitted to make the same changes except two toyota had decided to keep its two drivers timo glock and jarno trulli on dry tires and kept their fingers crossed the rain held off enough for them to not lose the time gained from choosing not to pit the decision initially proved a success for toyota as glock rose from seventh to fourth and left hamilton and sebastian vettel fighting it out for fifth the young german at that time driving for toro rosso was all over the back of hamiltons mclaren read the best lewis hamilton ive seen in six years says wolff read remarkable lewis hamilton joins pantheon of all time f1 greats i only prayed lewis hamilton crosses the line in fifth place to win the title lewis hamilton crosses the line in fifth place to win the title seemingly out of nowhere polish driver robert kubica unlapped himself on the inside of the final turn on lap 68 shaken by the surprise overtake hamilton took a wide path that allowed sebastian vettel past all of a sudden the 2008 world championship was in massas hands well i never give up so i kept pushing lewis hamilton told cnn soon after the race right until i got to the line and up until the second to last lap i was world champion pretty much but its never over until its over and then i lost position i only prayed that i could get it back and i couldnt catch this guy vettel and i got to turn 10 of 12 on the last lap and i hadnt overtaken him on the final lap with time and track rapidly running out it seemed all of hamiltons prayers were answered the heavens opened making is almost impossible for glock to find any grip on dry tires out in front almost 30 seconds ahead of the unfolding drama massa had taken the checkered flag with a flawless drive on home soil his ferrari garage celebrated wildly as did tens of thousands of fans in the grandstand who thought they were celebrating the first brazilian world champion since ayrton senna but on the 71st and final lap with the track now sodden after the torrential downpour glock had slowed so much both vettel and hamilton had been able to make up a 15 second deficit he lewis didnt know what was going on maurice hamilton said the team were shouting at him that he had to try and catch glock and he didnt know what they were talking about he had been trying to get past vettel that was his focus all this is panning out in front of him and hes trying to keep the car on the road because its wet with just one corner remaining hamilton edged his way past on the inside of glock who by this point was struggling to just keep the car on the track i wasnt close enough to get him vettel by turn 12 lewis hamilton recalled it just so happened that it was wet another guy was going very slow and i managed to get past him he said pausing briefly as if to relive that moment conspiracy theories the realization of what had happened gradually permeated through a jubilant ferrari garage causing one mechanic in now infamous television scenes to smash his head against the wall in anger as the sad reality finally set in for the team the crowd and massas family the mclaren garage spilled out onto the pit lane to celebrate with hamilton it was hugely dramatic and could have gone either way maurice hamilton says if the shower of rain had come a minute later he wouldnt have been world champion massa would have won and he wouldnt have passed timo glock it hinges on details like that there has been nothing like that since even in his fights with nico rosberg and the others theres never been anything as dramatic as that i dont think many world champions will tell you they had a finale like that in the immediate aftermath a confused glock swatted away questions in the mixed zone suggesting he had deliberately allowed hamilton to pass the pair had been friends coming through the ranks in gp2 and that only served to fuel conspiracy theories that glock moved aside for hamilton to win the title though they are allegations the german has refuted on several occasions its all over us again its 10 years ago and it seems its bigger than ever lots lots of feedback at least not all negative glock posted on instagram earlier this month still as a little reminder for those who still think i did it on purpose still some out there there is the on board of the whole last lap on youtube at least you can see the difficulties i faced enjoy in what was undoubtedly the most brutal moment of his career massa remained gracious in defeat and earned universal praise for the way he conducted himself after the race tears filled his eyes as he stood atop the podium proud but heartbroken that was so impressive maurice hamilton said to think for about a minute that youre world champion at home with all that emotion youve won the race and done everything you can he drove a brilliant race faultless and then to have that happen at the end he was very very dignified it was quite emotional on the podium it must have been very very tough to take you dont often see that and it was a tremendous display of sportsmanship considering the terrible disappointment and of course he would never get his chance again indeed that would be the closest massa ever got to winning a world title and he retired from the sport in 2017 the same year hamilton collected the fourth of his five championship wins the 33 year old has never been pushed so close in any of his subsequent victories and fans may be left waiting a while longer to witness another grand prix as dramatic as brazil 2008,Real

pressure constantly said hansen youre expected to win every test match and not only win it but win it really well once you come to realize that life becomes a little easier the pressure is there its

towards it as a team winger rieko ioane 21 added the pressure we put on each other is probably bigger than what everyone perceives we get on the outside thats probably what makes it easier to cope with the management are real harsh on the boys and the boys are harsh on each other so it makes it a healthy competitive environment hansen said players new to the set up feel it straight away and admitted the all blacks world can be an overwhelming place but stressed the key is to talk about it and help players cope with it in their own way once youve acknowledged its there you can deal with it he said natural athletes however saturdays clash has a bigger buzz than even when new zealand hosted the british and irish lions in 2017 says hansen we understand who we are and our history but youve got to be reasonably stupid if you cant work out this is going to be big he adds there will be 80 000 people it s all over the papers you cant get a ticket you must have been on holiday if you cant work out its going to be big the buzz is bigger that lions tour has made it bigger drawing the series for us wasnt successful so its made this week have a sharper edge to it lt strong gt what lt

champions league is it time to sympathize with psgs neymar,the memes of neymar rolling in agony along high streets and motorways remain one of the enduring memories of a thrilling world cup in russia spectacular goals and knee knocking finishes admittedly made the footballing world smile during the summer but so too did the neymarchallenge on social media as fans multinationals and even portugals 911 service mocked the brazilian superstars theatrics on the pitch according to swiss broadcaster rts the worlds most expensive player spent 14 minutes on the floor during footballs most celebrated tournament many of those minutes would have been spent rolling around in apparent agony before getting back on his feet again to continue with the dribbles flicks and no look passes neymar has created 17 chances in the first four champions league games of the season neymar has created 17 chances in the first four champions league games of the season but is neymar more sinned against than sinning should the paris saint germain forward receive more protection from referees and less ridicule from the masses according to bein sports data during the opening rounds of this seasons champions league the forward has been awarded 20 fouls 14 more than his teenage teammate kylian mbappe who is equally adept at bamboozling defenders with trickery and pace and 16 more than liverpools mo salah over the same number of games read neymar ridiculed for his theatrics barcelonas lionel messi who has played just twice in the champions league this season has won four fouls while juventus cristiano ronaldo has won seven over three games if all players are treated equally it is a striking statistic that neymar has won considerably more fouls in europes elite competition than the worlds other best

defense to mbappe early in first half at the stadio san paolo illustrated the danger neymars creativity alone poses to opponents he is also lethal in front of goal scoring three in the opening four group games napoli wisely though neymar himself would probably say unfairly paid close attention to the 26 year old towards the end of the match neymar booked in stoppage time for dissent could be seen shouting at referee bjorn kuipers and appeared to be held back by mbappe after taking issue with one of the referees decisions neymar c argues with netherlands 39 referee bjorn kuipers neymar c argues with netherlands referee bjorn kuipers the brazilian would later accuse the dutchman of saying something disrespectful to him during the match on the pitch we are asked to show respect towards the referees we should get the same in return he told reporters afterwards there were those on social media who sympathized with the brazilian he often frustrates me by going down too easy imo but you can see why he does on a night like this when he tries to stay on his feet and gets absolutely nothing tweeted journalist robin bairner in another tweet barnier said frustrating night for neymar hes been on the end of numerous niggling fouls several not given and yet hes been booked for dissent perhaps some of neymars problems are of his own making against switzerland at the world cup he was

how do you beat the all blacks,few teams from any sport any era or any country have a record that can match that of the all blacks since lifting the world cup on home soil in 2011 new zealands rugby team has boasted a win percentage close to 90 its reign as the world no 1 ranked side goes back nine years and it comes as no surprise that steve hansens men have been hotly tipped to win a third consecutive world cup in japan next year when it comes to the depth of players at their disposal not to mention the skill set and athleticism those players bring to the field its little surprise the all blacks have been rugbys dominant force for the best part of the past decade but thats not to say theyre unbeatable teams working out how to beat the all blacks which include england and ireland in the coming weeks will look to south africas performances in the rugby championship for inspiration you have to take your hat off to south africa former new zealand captain sean fitzpatrick tells cnn after the springboks came close to recording rare back to back victories over the all blacks the intensity they played with we havent seen that intensity for a long time their will and their fitness levels looked very good read why are the all blacks so good play video dan carter on japanese rugby and new zealand 03 10 south africas victory in wellington was only new zealands second defeat on home soil since 2009 is there a secret to toppling the all blacks the teams that take the all blacks on are the teams that are successful normally continues fitzpatrick who won 92 caps for new zealand in the 1980s and 90s including 51 as captain the problem is youve got to do it for 80 85 minutes and there arent many teams at the moment that can live with the all blacks for that long dont be afraid south africa showed that their aggression levels were very high they were very physical they didnt miss tackles they took their opportunities new zealand let in 132 points in the recent rugby championship the most it has ever conceded in the tournament the somewhat porous defense is something that didnt pass fitzpatrick by were fans who want to be entertained and the all blacks play a very entertaining style of rugby which sometimes as you saw during the rugby championship can leak tries thats one area theyre probably looking to sure up read rugby captain turned steel sculptor the

florida recounts expected to begin as tensions escalate across state,state election officials are expected to announce on saturday afternoon that the razor thin races for governor senator and agriculture commissioner will be reviewed in a series of automatically triggered recounts republican gov rick scott is ahead of incumbent democratic sen bill nelson by about 15 000 votes giving him a lead of less than 25 the margin in the governors race is larger with republican former rep ron desantis leading democratic tallahassee mayor andrew gillum by about 4 or nearly 36 000 votes those numbers could change by around noon on saturday when the unofficial counts are due if the current margins stay under 5 in any of the three statewide contests then votes in those races will be recounted by machine that recount must be finished by thursday at 3 pm et at which point the state can order a hand recount of overvotes and undervotes in any race within 25 an overvote means a voter selected more than the allotted options on the ballot an undervote means a vote selected fewer than the available choices or in these races none the senate race and the contest for agriculture commissioner currently fall within the 25 margin floridasenateest 99 in candidate votes scott 4 098 107 50 1 nelson 4 085 545 49 9 floridagovernorest 99 in candidate votes desantis 4 075 869 49 6 gillum 4 042 176 49 2 detailed updates on the state of the race have been hard to come by leading scott to successfully sue top election officials in broward and palm beach counties for details on the total votes cast and how many of them had been canvassed in broward supervisor of elections brenda snipes turned over information to scott and his team for review late friday but before midnight the campaign pushed out a new press release claiming snipes had not fully complied with the court order because she refuses to confirm whether or not additional ballots exist that must be counted adding to broward countys troubles a cnn analysis of votes cast there suggests that ballot design could be responsible for a substantial difference in the number of votes cast between the race for governor and the race for senator in florida there is also lingering drama in palm beach county where supervisor of elections susan bucher missed a similar deadline entirely she has asked for an emergency hearing earlier in the day bucher had been ordered by a judge to find and produce ballots she and her staff had invalidated without consulting a canvassing board she now has until noon to comply while the politicians tweeted and activists announced new protests this weekend demonstrators on the streets outside the broward county supervisor of elections office targeted snipes chanting lock her up and fake votes dont count as she and others worked inside trying to finish the initial vote count make america great again and trump 2020 signs and hats were also visible as a group carrying signs supporting scott and desantis were met by another backing the democrats as nose to nose screaming matches nearly escalated into physical altercations scott escalated already rising tensions across the state on thursday night when in a news conference he took a page from president donald trump and without citing any evidence accused left wing activists in broward county of trying to steal the election for nelson the county in deep blue portion of south florida is notoriously slow in counting its votes and as its tally mounted scotts lead had predictably diminished in a series of tweets on friday trump picked up the thread and accused the democrats of attempting election theft in broward and palm beach counties but scotts request for an investigation into election related fraud did not go far on friday the florida department of law enforcement said it was told by the department of state which is run by a republican scott appointee that they had received no allegation of criminal activity still scotts campaign issued an ominous sounding statement on saturday morning encouraging every florida sheriff to watch for any violations and take appropriate action meanwhile nelsons campaign filed suit against the state over its process for validating vote by mail ballots democratic lawyer marc elias who is running the nelson recount effort argued that floridas signature matching process put an undue onus on the untrained opinions of poll workers which led to a complete lack of uniformity in how the ballots were being judged this serves as an outright disenfranchisement and burden on the right to vote elias told reporters on a call friday south carolina sen lindsey graham has also injected himself into the fight alleging like scott and the president with no proof that there are shenanigans going on in broward and palm beach before suggesting in another tweet that a sinister cabal of liberals from washington was at work trying to rig the election in fact out of state lawyers from both parties including a handful who had significant roles 18 years ago have been flocking to florida ahead of the recount around the state on friday allegations and rumors of misplaced or lost votes fueled simmering anger and confusion as the campaigns lawyers operatives and freelance rabble rousers girded themselves for a re run of the pitched partisan combat that took over the state during the 2000 presidential recount outside a mail distribution center in miami dade county a group of activists with images they said showed undelivered ballots inside tried and failed to get a meeting with a supervisor later in the day a spokeswoman for the u s postal service said it was researching the matter to verify that all ballots have been handled in accordance to

brett kavanaugh tries to shun the spotlight he cant avoid,the last time most americans saw brett kavanaugh he was on national television testifying before senators emotional angry and insistent that democratic partisans were trying to destroy him with allegations of sexual assault from decades ago kavanaugh this is a national disgrace kavanaugh this is a national disgrace 02 51 now as president donald trump continues to hold up kavanaugh as a political trophy the new supreme court justice himself is trying to lower his profile for his formal investiture at the supreme court on thursday he did not appear for any photographs by the news media and skipped a traditional photo op on the marble steps where the public could have seen and protested him the court cited security concerns kavanaugh also seems inclined against a prominent role at next weeks annual meeting of the federalist society the group working with the white house to confirm conservative judges to which justice neil gorsuch trumps first appointee gave a rousing keynote speech last year within the court kavanaugh has deferred to his colleagues in oral arguments and quickly adhered to the courts institutional traditions the other justices have gone out of their way to be publicly welcoming and have shown an unusual degree of collegiality all around during arguments so far this term even laughing more at one anothers jokes trump gets another chance to celebrate kavanaugh at court ceremony trump gets another chance to celebrate kavanaugh at court ceremony in the few cases he has handled so far kavanaugh has declined some opportunities to favor the trump administration separating himself from gorsuch in early votes he has aligned more with chief justice john roberts than the far right of the bench all told kavanaugh appears to be lying low after the volatile confirmation process and buttressing roberts efforts to move the court away from the white hot media spotlight yet kavanaugh a political insider who spent 12 years on a us appeals court also understands that the media scrutiny will fade the record of kavanaugh 53 and appointed for life will become clear only over many months and years for the law in america the newest of the nine represents only part of a momentous change underway for years as the justices met privately to decide cases in a rich oak paneled conference room the person whose views mattered most was justice anthony kennedy whom kavanaugh succeeded a conservative with centrist tendencies on social issues including abortion race and gay rights kennedy was regularly the deciding vote like the lawyers who stood at the lectern and publicly argued before the high court individual justices often tailored their arguments around the private conference table to kennedy not one of the current nine has a similar centrist approach justices on both sides of the ideological divide are watching kavanaugh for any clues about how to best approach the new justice kavanaugh was carefully vetted by a trump team that did not want a vacillating jurist in the mode of kennedy gorsuch has fulfilled those expectations often partnering on the far right with justice clarence thomas for an originalist approach to the law tied to the constitutions 18th century origins gorsuchs emergence in the public eye last year however was fraught some of his moves spurning court practices miffed his colleagues who made their displeasure known he also garnered unusual attention on social media including among law professors for statements and writing that critics found inflated and self important kavanaughs style is different and he appears to be trying to make good on his oft repeated confirmation mantra about always being a team player on the team of nine trump invokes kavanaugh to rally base in montana trump invokes kavanaugh to rally base in montana where gorsuch immediately opted against having his clerks join the clerk pool that collectively screens petitions for certiorari seeking review of cases lost in lower courts kavanaugh has had his clerks join all justices but gorsuch and samuel alito are in the so called cert pool which dates to the 1970s in the private conference the junior justice has the responsibility of taking notes on the proceedings and answering the door if any aide knocks to offer a document or even a fetched set of forgotten reading glasses or a coffee cup requested by a justice that person is now kavanaugh he will also be last in line to cast his vote in tight cases he likely would be the fifth conservative sealing a victory for the right wing or he may prove unpredictable perhaps even defying his benefactor before this weeks midterm elections as trump tried to rally republicans he constantly invoked kavanaughs appointment and the democratic opposition he faced the day after the election the president boasted that the kavanaugh strategy paid off by expanding our senate majority the voters have also clearly rebuked the senate democrats for their handling of the kavanaugh hearings trump said at a white house news conference tremendous energy was given to the republican party by the way they treated then judge kavanaugh now justice kavanaugh he said voter kavanaugh hearing was 39 embarrassing 39 voter kavanaugh hearing was embarrassing 05 29 playing nice in public kavanaughs response to the sexual assault allegations of christine blasey ford prompted some lawyers and judges including retired justice john paul stevens to question his temperament and ability to be an impartial jurist former justice john paul stevens suggests kavanaugh should not sit on supreme court former justice john paul stevens suggests kavanaugh should not sit on supreme court during the senate hearing kavanaugh described fords claims as part of a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent up anger about president trump and the 2016 election revenge on behalf of the clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups individual justices are conflicted over how kavanaughs confirmation unfolded yet all have an incentive to be collegial and forward looking they have projected a business as usual image even appearing to be getting along better on the bench kavanaugh has now sat through three weeks of oral arguments he has held back and let his colleagues air their queries before jumping in he also has tried to take opportunities to question both sides in fractious cases perhaps to avoid being labeled with a predictably conservative approach fellow justices have shown regard for his questioning occasionally picking up on his line of inquiry what the treaty seems to prevent justice elena kagan observed to a lawyer at the lectern in one case is the state from taking either travel or as justice kavanaugh says travel with goods at another point kagan who sits next to kavanaugh on the bench said i think the import of justice kavanaughs question is that in the usual case in a separate dispute after kavanaugh had tried to enter the fray but was interrupted roberts stopped the lawyer at the lectern i think justice kavanaugh had a question roberts said ensuring kavanaugh an opening later in the same argument kavanaugh said to pick up on the chief justices comments play video chief justice we speak for the constitution 02 02 staying close to the chief justice while they are united in public with kennedys departure the court is more divided on the substance of the law split between five conservatives roberts kavanaugh gorsuch alito and clarence thomas and four liberals ruth bader ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and kagan yet the chief justice has been determined to show that the court is above politics roberts may end up inching to the left himself in some cases to avoid some 5 4 splits and may find a new ally in kavanaugh john roberts touts collegiality but supreme court 39 s record suggests otherwise john roberts touts collegiality but supreme courts record suggests otherwise how those justices on the right band together or not could make a difference in the cases the court takes up and the fate of long standing precedents for example on abortion rights where kavanaugh falls on the ideological spectrum could also affect larger constitutional dilemmas provoked by trumps demonstrated disregard for legal norms kavanaugh and roberts a decade older at 63 have known each other for nearly 30 years both served in the us solicitor generals office during the george h w bush administration roberts as a deputy sg and kavanaugh on a fellowship for young lawyers during the george w bush administration kavanaugh obtained top legal jobs and roberts won court appointments first to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in 2003 and then to the supreme court in 2005 kavanaugh himself then served on the dc circuit reinforcing their common path they have long had a friendly relationship last month when kavanaugh underwent a ceremonial investiture at the white house following his 50 48 confirmation vote by the senate he went out of his way to praise roberts chief justice roberts is a principled independent and inspiring leader for the american judiciary kavanaugh said as a country we are fortunate to have john roberts as chief justice of the united states roberts returned the favorable comments when he spoke of judicial independence after referring to the contentious events in washington at the university of minnesota the following week exclusive club harvard yale and former clerks dominate supreme court exclusive club harvard yale and former clerks dominate supreme court as our newest colleague put it we do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle we do not caucus in separate rooms we do not serve one party or one interest we serve one nation roberts said not siding with trump yet the 2018 19 session which began a week before kavanaugh was seated last month is still so new that he and most justices have yet to issue any written opinions but kavanaugh has taken actions that separate him from the conservative stalwarts in late october when the court took up a challenge to the commerce departments addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census kavanaugh was with the majority in allowing lower court proceedings to continue and testimony to be taken from a key justice department lawyer in the dispute while his fellow conservatives gorsuch and thomas dissented separately the full court blocked the challengers from obtaining testimony from commerce secretary wilbur ross how kavanaugh maneuvered to win his confirmation fight how kavanaugh maneuvered to win his confirmation fight a week later on november 2 the court by a 6

supreme court again over public dissents from thomas and gorsuch rejected a trump administration request to block a lawsuit by youths who want to hold the government responsible for emissions policy and climate change related supreme court wont block childrens climate change lawsuit in none of those three matters did kavanaugh write anything that became public trump had no public comment on any

register this week that would block migrants from applying for asylum outside of official ports of entry like imposing a travel ban ending daca or slashing temporary protected status tps this new effort is already facing legal challenges but the asylum rule is another clear example of what the administration has shown time and again it will take action on immigration with or without congress on board controversial policies will face more scrutiny some of the administrations most controversial immigration policy moves are going to face a new wave of scrutiny in a democratic controlled house where lawmakers have vowed to increase oversight hearings that means we could learn many more previously undisclosed details behind family separations the administrations decisions to end daca and tps and officials decision to add a citizenship question to the census but democrats dont control the house yet and before they do theres a budget showdown on the horizon in december republicans warn there 39 s a 39 big fight 39 brewing over trump 39 s border wall republicans warn theres a big fight brewing over trumps border wall a continuing resolution passed in september effectively tabled a contentious border wall funding fight but congress now faces a december 7 deadline to avert a government shutdown and will have to vote on a spending bill that includes border wall funding thats not the only controversial immigration measure that could come up for debate another area likely to face pushback from some democrats requests for increased funding for immigrant detention beds theyre still not in control as we head into this negotiation moran said next year youre going to have more muscle and more fight on that issue trumps next attorney general pick could have a big impact on where things go from here while trump repeatedly chided sessions publicly the former attorney general was an effective emissary helping to conceive and carry out many of the administrations hardline efforts as the trump administration quietly rewrote immigration policy sessions led the charge he reinterpreted asylum law set quotas for immigration judges and served as a prominent face for the administrations zero tolerance policy which resulted in thousands of family separations at the border and for its decision to end daca sessions defends trump on immigration policy sessions defends trump on immigration policy 00 55 groups that favor increased immigration restrictions frequently praised his performance theres little doubt that whoever trump picks to fill sessions shoes will have a similar mission and ideology but theres a key unanswered question will the next attorney general be as effective as sessions was at pulling the right levers behind the scenes some are already expressing their doubts mark krikorian executive director of the center for immigration studies a think tank that advocates restricting immigration noted that even with a republican controlled

the four people who will determine the fate of russia probe,leading figures in the russia drama face fateful choices in the coming days and months that could tip america into a political and constitutional abyss with the midterm elections in the rearview a sense of foreboding is settling over washington the gravity and consequences of the investigation suddenly seem oppressive with special counsel robert mueller writing his final report and an unchained president donald trump aggressively seeking to check him new acting attorney general matthew whitaker and the likely next house speaker nancy pelosi must quickly adapt to new circumstances and powers that have made them vital players at a critical moment of the intrigue it is becoming increasingly clear not least from trumps raging mood that the end game of the russia saga will subject the mechanisms of the us government to extreme stress and test the nations shattered cohesion the president disrupt or stand pat trump pointed out in his post election news conference on wednesday that although he believes the russia investigation is very bad for our country he has so far not shut it down i could have ended it anytime i wanted i didnt and there was no collusion he said but there is speculation that he could use whitaker as a tool to interfere with muellers probe or stifle its conclusions or even to try to fire the special counsel any of those options could ignite a constitutional conflagration alternatively trump could choose to wait for the final report into allegations his campaign colluded with russia in 2016 and he obstructed justice to cover it up the president has already given an ominous glimpse of his intentions within hours of midterm polls closing trump ejected attorney general jeff sessions who had recused himself from oversight of the russia investigation trump installed whitaker above deputy attorney general rod rosenstein who has been giving cover to mueller and his investigators while overseeing the probe some critics interpreted trumps move as his latest bid to undermine the investigation or remove officials he sees as a threat in what legal commentators are now calling a slow motion saturday night massacre in reference to watergate there is a building debate over whether trumps appointment of whitaker might have been in itself an abuse of power still there were signs on thursday that there has been no disruption to oversight of the mueller probe rosensteins top deputy principal associate deputy attorney general ed ocallaghan met lawyers from the special counsels team in a regular biweekly meeting a source familiar with the matter told cnns laura jarrett the source explained that while whitaker has ultimate oversight authority as the acting attorney general the day to day running of the probe is still being handled by rosensteins office its business as usual the source said the president is on dangerous ground if he decides to pressure the investigation if it later comes out that trump by design put whitaker in position to thwart the investigation he could provide more evidence that he is guilty of a corrupt purpose to obstruct justice that will send him down a path that for the next few years that would tie up his presidency in ways that are not in his best interests legally or politically said michael zeldin a former senior justice department official with a touch of understatement on cnn international on thursday the new acting attorney general suddenly on the hot seat play video whitaker likes to talk about mueller 02 08 cnn revealed on thursday that whitaker has publicly shot down the idea that russian interfered in the 2016 election contradicting multiple mueller indictments now he is suddenly thrust into the most high stakes legal political showdown involving different branches of government since watergate he has the power to narrow the investigation and limit the budget for the special counsels team he could refuse requests by mueller to request indictments or to subpoena testimony from the president he could try to stifle publication of muellers final report or could try to keep it from congress michael conway counsel for the house judiciary committee during watergate said that the most sinister threat to mueller may be a quiet attempt to suppress his work by whitaker out of sight of congress or the public the concern would be that behind the scenes he would in a whole variety of ways thwart the investigation without the issue of a public firing without the issue of a cataclysmic event that would generate immediate political backlash said conway now a professor at the medill school of journalism democrats demanded whitaker recuse himself over his previous criticism of mueller a largely academic exercise since its obvious his main attraction to trump is that he is not prevented from overseeing the investigation the first sign that whitaker is acting against mueller could come if there are no indictments in the weeks to come or signs of activity at the grand jury if indictments follow it could be a sign whitaker stepped back one interpretation of trumps swift rejigging of the justice department after the midterms is that the president did not want time for mueller to produce any indictments after the end of a self imposed hiatus during the political season whitaker has walked into tremendous personal pressure trump has made no secret of his visceral anger at mueller and has shown in his dealings with fired former fbi director james comey and sessions that he expects loyalty to him to supersede everything whitaker will face the same demands and is in a far weaker position than either sessions or comey who enjoyed personal power bases and reputations and alliances forged after decades of public service once he is read into the mueller investigation the new attorney general will face an ethical question will he tell trump what he knows even though doing so would cross an ethical line but whitaker is also in a legally vulnerable position he risks being pulled into a conspiracy if the president or other officials seek to unlawfully obstruct the investigation he is likely to be hauled up to capitol hill by the new democratic house majority in the new year and be forced to testify under oath about his appointment he might remember that nixon attorney general john mitchell was convicted for his role in watergate at some point whitaker may face the ultimate dilemma for a washington law enforcement official caught in a scandal does his duty to the constitution or his president take priority mueller keep calm and carry on muellers silence has been his best defense against ferocious efforts by trump and the conservative media machine to draw him into the political swamp so it is and always will be impossible to know what he thinks about the new justice department hierarchy cnn reported thursday that the special counsel had started writing his final report recent weeks grand jury activity indicates that mueller is trying to find out whether trumps longtime adviser roger stone knew in advance that wikileaks would release hacked material during the 2016 campaign but there was also a reminder on thursday that his freedom to act could be in doubt when michael dreeben a prosecutor for the special counsels office acknowledged in court that whitaker could change or rescind the may 2017 order that appointed mueller people who have worked with mueller believe he has already prepared for the suppression or shutting down of his work he has for instance farmed out the tax fraud case against trumps former personal lawyer michael cohen to prosecutors in new york there was speculation in washington recently that sealed indictments against targets of the probe may already have been filed mueller has some protection in his initial charge from rosenstein if whitaker takes steps to constrain mueller he would be required to explain to the leadership of the senate and house judiciary committees why he did so in theory he can also only be fired for cause or misconduct in the last resort his resignation would provoke a political firestorm that could lead to impeachment proceedings against the president but it would also risk the possibility that much of his work does not see the light of day pelosi the institutional check on trump pelosi is likely to be the next house speaker and will have the power to have an institutional check on the administration she will have authority over house committees that will

white house issues new rule limiting asylum seekers,the trump administration said thursday it will restrict the ability of those crossing illegally to seek asylum on the southern us border in a move previewed by the president last week the rule becomes effective once a presidential proclamation is issued which is expected to happen friday according to senior administration officials the administration announced a new federal rule issued by the department of homeland security and the justice department that will limit eligibility for asylum seekers coming from mexico in a call with reporters thursday afternoon the interim rule which is set to be published in the federal register on friday states that if applied to a proclamation suspending the entry of aliens who cross the southern border unlawfully would bar such aliens from eligibility for asylum and thereby channel inadmissible aliens to ports of entry where they would be processed in a controlled orderly and lawful manner the rule adds that aliens who enter prior to the effective date of an applicable proclamation will not be subject to the asylum eligibility bar unless they depart and reenter while the proclamation remains in effect the regulation will also amend the screening process for aliens subject to a bar on asylum eligibility a senior administration official said the rule does not specify whom it applies to but discusses the issue in the context of increasing asylum claims from central america we do not expect one action to solve immigration problems the officials said trump says he will restrict asylum claims troops will shoot at rock throwers trump says he will restrict asylum claims troops will shoot at rock throwers this is just one effort to address the issue and i would expect we would work on additional measures in the future one official said an official on the call said the department of homeland security has started to work on staffing models to handle asylum claims they will be seeing at legal ports of entry a justice department official said the rule was signed off by attorney general jeff sessions before he tendered his resignation this week not the new acting attorney general matthew whitaker the american civil liberties union called the rule illegal us law specifically allows individuals to apply for asylum whether or not they are at a port of entry it is illegal to circumvent that by agency or presidential decree said omar jadwat director of the aclus immigrants rights project the center for american progress also challenged the interim final rules legality saying it violates the plain text of the ina when congress in 1996 enacted sweeping immigration enforcement legislation putting in place the expedited removal system that today allows border patrol agents to quickly deport people they apprehend without any court process it specifically created the credible fear process to preserve the right of people to seek asylum when they are apprehended between the ports of entry said tom jawetz vice president of immigration policy at the center for american progress in a statement congress did that knowing that if it circumscribed the right to seek protection then it would run afoul of our obligations under us and international law to not return people to face persecution abroad the interim final rule issued today acknowledges this history even as it attempts to undo it entirely human rights firsts eleanor acer called the new rule the latest shameful tactic in a years long campaign to vilify and punish those who seek protection in this country president trumps scheme violates refugee treaties and is a convoluted attempt to rewrite the laws enacted by congress to protect those seeking asylum this country is more than capable of safely processing asylum seekers to determine who among them have protection claims border officers already have extensive tools and resources that allow them to identify any individuals seeking entry who present a danger acer added there was an effort to finalize the rule in time for the president to sign by friday morning before he leaves for paris according to a senior administration official trump first revealed plans to take unilateral steps during a rambling and detail free speech from the white house last week warning of a crisis at the southern border trumps remarks were viewed as a political stunt days before the midterms since tuesdays vote which saw democrats take control of the house but republicans retain control of the senate the president hasnt mentioned the immigration orders or tweeted about the migrant caravan that formed his campaign closing argument a white house aide told cnn ahead of trumps remarks last week the president would unveil an executive action requiring migrants to request asylum at legal points of entry and preventing them from claiming asylum if they are caught crossing the border illegally although the president referenced such a policy in his speech he offered no defense of how such a plan once finalized could be legal given laws presently allowing migrants the right to claim asylum once they are on american soil the trump administration has been looking at ways to limit the number of asylum seekers with the president and his allies often describing asylum as a loophole the immigration and nationality act says that anyone who arrives in the us whether or not at a designated port of arrival may apply for asylum if he or she has a well founded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion cnn has also reported the administration is considering a plan to limit the number of migrants able to enter at legal ports of entry by metering essentially creating a waitlist to allow people to enter only if the department of homeland security has the capacity to process and detain them at one of its facilities a department official said in the past the practice of metering has resulted in individuals deciding not to endure a lengthy wait to try to get into the country legally and instead to cross illegally should some of this group of migrants do the latter they could face a tougher and higher standard for seeking asylum under the administrations plans cnns betsy klein contributed to this report,Real

marvel concept artist reveals what james gunn added to groots design for avengers infinity war,after being set up in the mid credits scenes for guardians of the galaxy vol 2 fans got to see the crappy attitude of teenage groot in all of his snooty glory in avengers infinity war and though joe and anthony russo took the reins in charting this characters adventure it was guardians director james gunn who had a major influence on groots appearance in the new movie according to senior visual development artist anthony francisco james gunn also wanted to add a bit of an ungroomed attitude where he does not clean up after himself like trimming his greenery in those awkward spaces and adding a little belly to show him not caring about his appearance francisco told the art of avengers infinity war as an executive producer on the new movie gunn had a lot of influence over the direction of the guardians in avengers infinity war and not just with the characters appearances infinity war co writer christopher markus spoke about how james gunn affected the films story james contributions were primarily voice related to make sure that we are not rolling out people who bear no resemblance to people in the preceding guardians movies markus said to the hollywood reporter he was on board everywhere we were taking them he adjusted one choice in the movie that didnt really affect how the movie played but it affected character a little bit it was a very interesting choice and first we wavered on it and then guardians star chris pratt backed him up and we acknowledged if anyone knows these characters its them co writer stephen mcfeely addressed how infinity war brought in many popular marvel characters from different franchises including black panther and doctor strange and how they were able to lean on the filmmakers for guidance thats the benefit of all of this the filmmakers who spent a lot of time with these characters get to come in and help us make sure we are getting it letter perfect mcfeely said there are 23 people on that poster so there are going to be people who are slightly more expert at those characters than we are so we did that with everybody doctor strange director scott derrickson and black panther director ryan coogler and thor ragnarok director taika waititi and ant man director peyton reed 0 comments well see how those directors influences extend into the future when avengers 4 premieres in theaters on may 3,Real
leaked avengers 4 art reveals the team s new white suits,the merchandising for avengers 4 has been the source of a lot of leaks lately and though there s much debate to be had on the authenticity and the implications of what we ve been seeing the intel has certainly done its job in getting fans excited about what may or may not be coming down the pipeline in next year s sequel just take this latest leak for instance having surfaced over on reddit earlier this morning the source for it is still unclear but it appears to be some early concept art for either the film itself or merchandise related to it and shows us the avengers in their new white costumes which we ve caught a few glimpses of already it s thought that these shiny suits will be donned by earth s mightiest heroes for their journey into space or even the quantum realm after all we know that the avengers infinity war sequel will feature some interplanetary trips while the realm itself was more or less confirmed earlier this year to have a lot of significance to the story though some have cast doubt on this latest leak being genuine it s important to note that rocket is seen here in the same stance as he was in on that leaked photo from september which was indeed real and in case you ve forgotten about it we ve included it in the gallery below so you can compare leaked avengers 4 art reveals the teams new white suits 1 of 12 prevnext click to zoom speaking of that picture it spawned much speculation thanks to the accompanying text s suggestion of new foes and an even greater threat given that the main antagonist of infinity war was a genocidal tyrant who reduced half the universe s population into dust with the mere snap of his fingers we struggle to think of what could qualify as a bigger danger but recent theories are suggesting a powerful new ally for thanos circling back to this latest leak though and as always we d suggest approaching it with a sense of caution at least until a source can be confirmed that being said what we see here does look pretty exciting and even if it s not exactly how the heroes will appear on screen in avengers 4 you can be sure that most of the characters will be receiving some sort of upgrade or change in the costume department at some point in the film,Real
captain americas early infinity war design resembled us agent,chris evans captain america in this years avengers infinity war was a man without a country a former patriot turned fugitive insurgent after the events of 2016s captain america civil war but while infinity war ultimately dressed the marvel cinematic universes superhero in a faded tattered version of his uniform from civil war early concept art for the film had a different design for the star spangled avenger revealed in marvels avengers infinity war the art of the movie concept art by marvel studios head of visual development ryan meinerding had steve rogers originally sporting an outfit inspired by recurring captain america friend and foe us agent with more black than the usual dark blue and a prominent stars and stripes design across the torso related thicc shirtless biker thanos smolders in avengers infinity war movie art book the secret avenger look came about because him being more clandestine and not part of a larger group like the avengers meant that he could be wearing more black explained meinerding about the early design thats where the us agent stuff came out too where he could be wearing black and red and see if there was any value in that following the events of civil war evans character was rumored to take on the alter ego nomad an alternate persona used by steve rogers after dropping the mantle of captain america in the comics in the 1970s this rumor was ultimately refuted by infinity war co director joe russo now meinerding reveals that marvel studios president kevin feige wanted to find a way for the character to retain his iconic look while acknowledging his drastic change in status related cap leaves his costume behind in early avengers infinity war concept art the costume took a long time because i think kevin feige was looking for ways of cap still feeling iconic he didnt want him stepping away from the super hero stuff for the whole movie and if you put him in fatigues at the beginning of the movie theres not really a reason for him to get out of them or change costumes at any point in the rest of the film continued meinerding so we were searching for a while including versions that were riffs on us agent and some things that were riffs on nomad subtle one but still trying to go there to see if there was something interesting to mine as if hes almost taken on a different persona with the stars and stripes emblazoned across the early designs torso steve rogers proposed outfit is recognizable but too visibly different than previous incarnations of his uniform as captain america throughout his earlier appearances in the mcu the costume used in the final film is more consistent with previous iterations with vertical stars and stripes displayed less prominently and the outline of the single iconic star still present on the chest though the star itself appears long since discarded by the fugitive superhero related lokis infinity war fate was very different in an earlier script the scrapped design evokes the captain america rival created by writer mark gruenwald and artist kieron dwyer in the pages of 1989s captain america 354 its also is visually reminiscent of steve rogers 1980s alter ego the captain introduced in captain america 337 before rogers ultimately confronts future us agent john walker in captain america 350 and reclaims the mantle he had previously abandoned while its unlikely that chris evans will adopt the design in next years avengers 4 the concept art does provide an interesting look at how the character could have appeared while operating as a rogue superhero in the eyes of the international community without abandoning his patriotic ideals in the meantime both marvels avengers infinity war the art of the movie and the film are available now,Real

will gompertz reviews russia royalty the romanovs,this exhibition at the queens gallery in buckingham palace starts with a huge painting of a huge man the aptly named peter the great of russia the first tsar to leave his country in over 100 years the catalogue says it presents us with a tall virile handsome warrior image copyrightroyal collection trust image caption sir godfrey knellers portrait of tsar peter i 1672 1725 who was the first russian ruler to visit england the diplomat prince boris kurakin 1676 1727 was similarly enamoured with the artwork he said the famed portrait of his czarish majesty standing in all his imperial armour and so attractive that i have nowhere seen its equal i do not share their view godfrey knellers very grand and historically significant picture depicts a bug eyed 6ft 7in fey looking 26 year old who seems to be as much at home in his suit of armour as ann widdecombe was on strictly come dancing the painting was peters gift to the english king william iii to mark his three month long fact finding visit to england in 1698 the ambitious young ruler was keen to build a russian navy from scratch to match those of the great european powers image copyrightroyal collection trust image caption william iii was happy to overlook peter the greats wayward behaviour so he rented a house in deptford from the writer and diarist john evelyn a chum of samuel pepys and set about learning all there was to know about shipbuilding at the local dockyard while hoovering up tips on navigation from the nearby royal observatory at greenwich the trip was a tremendous success for peter who by the end of his reign had 28 000 men serving 49 ships and around 800 smaller boats it wasnt so good for john evelyn though his majestic tenant had a rock stars approach to renting paintings were used for target practice wheelbarrows as go karts and the furniture that which remained was left in more pieces than a jigsaw of st petersburg william iii was happy to overlook the wayward behaviour of his russian opposite number seeing the empire building emperor as an important strategic ally and valued trading partner and so began a diplomatic relationship between the two monarchies that would span centuries marriages wars and the exchanges of many gifts and paintings image copyrightroyal collection trust image caption the coronation portrait of empress catherine ii 1729 1796 by vigilius eriksen was believed to have been given to king george iii on the whole it is the gifts and subsequent purchases of russian objects made by the british royal family that are the stars of this show the paintings are a mixed bag some good some bad none great quite unlike the cabinets full of pieces by the russian jeweller peter carl faberg which are exquisite his pair of late 19th century decanters topped off with silver dolphins with mouths formed into spouts are wonderful as is the gold and blue moire guilloche enamel cigarette case which is decorated with a diamond set snake biting its tail a symbol of everlasting love it was given to king edward vii by his mistress alice keppel image copyrightroyal collection trust and then there are the three imperial faberg eggs the most striking of which is the mosaic egg and surprise the lattice like exterior is not only the most beautiful piece of craftsmanship but is also a profoundly sad vessel encapsulating a tragic event inside the egg the surprise is an enamel portrait of five children in profile on the reverse of which is a basket of flowers and an inscription of each of their names tsar nicholas ii commissioned it for his wife alexandra queen victorias granddaughter as an easter present the children it depicts are theirs image copyrightroyal collection trust image caption mosaic egg and surprise 1914 by faberg was originally commissioned by nicholas ii and later bought by king george v and queen mary it was made in the spring of 1914 shortly before russia became embroiled in world war one nicholas was not a great leader nor a popular figure millions of russian soldiers died leading to revolution and his forced abdication in 1917 the provisional government confiscated the mosaic egg and surprise the tsar asked the british royal family to rescue him after all the families went a long way back as this exhibition demonstrates king george v declined on 17 july 1918 tsar nicholas his wife and all five children were executed by bolshevik guards fifteen years later george v purchased the mosaic egg and surprise from cameo corner london for 250 this is but one of the hundreds of historical events reflected in the objects and paintings in this rigorously researched exhibition it is a grand tale of international relations and inter family arrangements of cultural exchange and competing agendas the major players line the walls in over the top gilt frames while the objects that fill the exhibition spaces tell their stories image copyrightroyal collection trust image caption laurits regner tuxens painting of the marriage of nicholas ii emperor of russia in 1894 to princess alix of hesse who was queen victorias granddaughter there are instances when the object is not as interesting as the piece of history it represents but that is not the case in the sideshow of roger fenton photographs of the crimean war that is connected to the main exhibition which serves as a reminder that all was not always rosy in the 300 year anglo russian relationship fentons intelligently composed images of the soldiers and battlegrounds are as good as those produced on any subject since the birth of the medium when you take into account the limitations of his equipment and the hostile environment in which he was using it you quickly recognise that his photographs are remarkable having been commissioned by the print publishers thomas agnew sons to take pictures of british and french soldiers as source material for a studio painting by thomas barker fenton set off for the crimea in the spring of 1855 with a makeshift horse drawn photographic van and an assistant he organised group photographs individual portraits and desolate landscapes strewn with the debris of war the most famous photo is valley of the shadow of death a bleak and barren dirt track littered with cannonballs an image of armageddon image copyrightroyal collection trust image caption valley of the shadow of death 1855 by roger fenton who places the viewer at the bottom of the ravine filled with cannonballs it is a haunting picture of war without any blood or bodies his portrait of the unlucky lord balgonie who stares out into the middle distance in wide eyed confusion is thought to be the first image taken of shellshock image copyrightroyal collection trust image caption roger fentons photograph of lord balgonie in 1855 is thought to be the first visual record of someone suffering from shell shock there are few occasions in the exhibition where a fenton photograph is hung beside a picture an artist has produced from it and the comparison is illuminating it brings home fentons genius for finding the truth in his subject and the utter hopelessness of the artist attempting to do the same when he returned home his crimea photographs were much admired by queen victoria and her tech savvy husband prince albert who had previously commissioned the photographer to take portraits of the royal family image copyrightroyal collection trust image caption queen victoria and prince albert 1854 by roger fenton being sensible people they bought the lot,Real

conceptual art can never capture the tragedy of the great war,our years of official remembering reach their climax on sunday at the cenotaph and at humbler memorials all across the united kingdom in london prince charles will lay the wreath the queen will watch from the balcony of the foreign office and the band will lead the parade with its jaunty selection of first world war songs big ben will ring out once again to mark the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month and the end of a war that has had a tighter grip on britain s cultural though not political imagination than any other but as we come to the end of the centenary commemorations i wonder how much they have changed or enlarged our understanding of this great catastrophe poppies sculptures to be installed in london and manchester read more i am old enough to know a time when the great war was an everyday memory one or two of my secondary schoolteachers had fought in it sometimes i reckon up the years in surprise a man born say in 1895 could have served in the trenches and still been a few years from retirement when i sat in his class to learn chemistry my maternal grandfather a sniper with the royal scots was wounded in flanders while a paternal great uncle a company sergeant major in the same regiment died at passchendaele other great uncles on my mother s side whom my mother was too young to remember much about were included among the dead on a nearby town s memorial this is a common enough story my grandfather would speak wryly but briefly about his experience on the western front while my father would talk fondly of his sergeant major uncle who did daring things such as leaping from a slowing train before it reached the station so that he could run down the embankment and be quicker home for his tea i knew of the great war from these anecdotes and also from a few keepsakes in the house a glengarry cap and a tattered book of bruce bairnsfather s cartoons well if you knows of a better ole go to it gen douglas haig was hated because armistice poppies were produced in his name we never wore any but only with the coming of joan littlewood s musical oh what a lovely war and the bbc series marking its 50th anniversary did the war assume a clearer shape in the eyes of a generation born nearly 30 years after it had ended whose childhoods were marked by its successor conflict and the dambusters rather than the film of all quiet on the western front this was the shape we still know the war as a tragedy that ended or ruined millions of lives it was easier then to keep this idea alive because so many survivors of the actuality still lived among us though long before the last of them disappeared in 2009 the old rituals had begun to seem emptier and timeworn the 100th anniversary needed new ways to stimulate public interest and it found them by turning commemoration into a more artful experience liberating it from the confines of the little crowd that surrounded the local war memorial on a november morning or the marching band patriotism of the british legion show at the albert hall guardian today the headlines the analysis the debate sent direct to you read more the spectacle of the multitude arrived in 2014 possibly inspired by ai weiwei s installation of millions of porcelain sunflower seeds at the tate modern four years before the ceramic artist paul cummins and a team of assistants planted the moat of the tower of london with 888 246 ceramic red poppies each flower to represent a life lost in the conflict by britain and its colonies the installation was a tremendous popular success over four months more than 5 million people are thought to have visited it and now the war s end is being marked by several examples of the similarly multitudinous at ypres 600 000 little clay figures have been spread densely across open land to mark the war s victims on belgian territory at the tower of london the moat has been filled with 10 000 burning torches which are lit one by one every night to the sound of choral music and at stratford in east london 72 396 shrouded plastic dolls stretch out on a strip of the olympic park to represent the british and commonwealth soldiers who died at the somme and have no known grave i don t know about ypres but this week i went to the displays at stratford and the tower and found they touched nothing in me shrouds of the somme is an odd idea made odder by the sale of more shrouded dolls in the gift shop 75 in a frame and 35 in a box where they lay as if intended to encourage little children to play with the dead at the tower marshals in hi vis jackets organised large crowds into winding queues that shuffled slowly through the dark towards the lights and the music earlier in the week i saw peter jackson s film they shall not grow old his marvellous restoration of footage from the trenches and found it a thousand times more moving in fact more moving and informative things are everywhere present and everywhere forgotten the people hurrying towards the tower strode past the memorial to merchant seamen that spreads across tower hill and so far as i could tell from five minutes observation not one of them paused to look at its bronze plaques which list the dead by ship they sailed in athenia glasgow ausonia liverpool under a general dedication to the 12 000 sailors of the great war who have no other grave but the sea at liverpool street station the memorial to the dead of the great eastern railway was likewise ignored i sought it out on my way from stratford and discovered something beneath it i had never noticed before a bronze relief of field marshal sir henry wilson the chief of the imperial general staff at the war s end who according to the inscription had died on 22 june 1922 within two hours of his unveiling the adjoining memorial what the inscription didn t say was that two ira men had shot him outside his house in eaton place as he left the taxi that had taken him from the ceremony his assassins were quickly captured and on the day two months later when they were hanged wilson s big house in county longford was burned to the ground he had always considered himself an irishman as well as a unionist the memorial that owes its inspiration to conceptual art can never reflect such complexity nor is that its intention but even at the level of the big bold statement it suffers by comparison with its precedents what could be more disturbing or multitudinous than the apparently endless ranks of real graves in flanders what as an event that involves you could be better than to visit the field of remembrance outside westminster abbey and there give some money and in return take a cross or some other religious or secular remembrance and write the deceased s name on it and then borrow a mallet and drive the little piece of wood softly into the piece of lawn that has been reserved for his military unit or regiment i have done this occasionally in memory of my great uncle the company sergeant major and did it again on thursday as the field was a stunt invented by earl haig s poppy factory in 1928 my little ceremony flies in the face of family prejudice and i never feel completely at ease this year i noticed that the royal scots plot was filled to the brim and looked as neat and crowded as a miniature version of those white cemeteries across the channel conceptual art before the term was invented and no art involved thank god ian jack is a guardian columnist since you re here we have a small favour to ask more people are reading the guardian s independent investigative journalism than ever but advertising revenues across the media are falling fast and unlike many news organisations we haven t put up a paywall we want to keep our reporting as open as we can so you can see why we need to ask for your help the guardian is editorially independent meaning we set our own agenda our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners politicians or shareholders no one edits our editor no one steers our opinion this is important because it enables us to give a voice to the voiceless challenge the powerful and hold them to account it s what makes us different to so many others in the media at a time when factual honest reporting is critical if everyone who reads our reporting who likes it helps to support it our future would be much more secure for as little as 1 you can support the guardian and it only takes a minute thank you,Real
artist laurent durieux breaks down every poster in his new mondo show,laurent durieux belongs on the short list of the best pop culture artists working today his classical style his subtle wit and his attention to detail lead to posters that are often astonishing to behold austin s mondo gallery is playing host to durieux s latest gallery show titled the art of laurent durieux part two which opens today and runs through november 17 we got in touch with durieux and he supplied us with the inspirations behind and origins of every print on display and for sale at the show including posters for planet of the apes ghostbusters apocalypse now the shining and more conan the barbarian it was first a commission from milan records france whom i had worked with before for merry christmas mr lawrence and oldboy soundtracks lp artworks it s also one of the first if not the first movie i watched in a theater as a kid and it left a great impression on me i was scared that when i had to re watch it to do the poster the movie would have aged badly but it really didn t it was just as awesome for a 48 year old guy as it was for an 11 year old boy planet of the apes believe it or not as a kid i collected the planet of the apes figurines the tv shows were very popular in europe in the late 70s so when i was asked to chose the movies choosing pota was a no brainer to me i had to do it i re watched it again and just like conan it is still as great a movie today as it was 40 years ago ex machina this movie is in my top five best science fiction movies of all time along with blade runner alien gattaca and star wars the scenario is perfect everything in this movie is just first rate i think it will be regarded as a masterpiece of anticipation fiction like netflix s black mirror in a few years the idea for my poster was to illustrate the fact that caleb found himself prisoner of ava s manipulative intelligence like we could all be very soon with ai or aren t we already ghostbusters i was done with my show and mondo s mitch putnam contacted me to see if we could add a true geek film to the list so i did it it s always a personal challenge for me to tackle movies that are so popular you would almost choke it s not my favourite movie as it is i m sure for many younger folks but it s pretty cool and it does remind me of my teenage years way back when the shining i don t usually like horror movies but here it s so much more than that what could i say kubrick s masterpiece of horror is a genuine masterpiece indeed its one of those you can watch a hundred times and discover new things new details you hadn t noticed before there are so many layers on this film that i think i could have made 10 different posters for it the typewriter axe project was originally done as a concept sketch for one of my fans who attended either mondocon or thoughtbubble in leeds and i always loved it there are quite a lot of existing projects with the typewriter out there but i somehow managed to come up with something no one had thought of before the shining here is an iconic sequence from the film i couldn t really do anything for the shining and not use this scene the image without the door of room 237 hidden on the tricycle back seat wouldn t be interesting at all i m not sure people will see the idea straight away but just like my jaws poster it s hiding in plain view apocalypse now three years ago i was contacted by francis ford coppola s collaborator to ask me if i would be interested in designing creating the visual for a steel box edition of the film i had to turn down the offer as my schedule wasn t allowing me to do it and told them that they probably would have to wait a couple of years before i could get to it i was expecting them to tell me well okay we ll find someone else who could do it for us quicker but to my surprise they said mr coppola will wait apparently francis didn t want anyone else but me to tackle his masterpiece of a film what an honor apocalypse now titanic this was a convention sketch commission done during thought bubble in leeds i showed it to eric garza right then and asked if they could get the license for it as there are plenty of titanic fans out there you know who you are yes you there with the badass tattoos i love the movie period i thought the idea was pretty cool and witty that s our job as creators to bring new interpretations on films mystery train this was originally commissioned by milan records france to design the artwork for the lp cd soundtrack i had never seen the movie before that and i loved it steve buscemi alone was a good reason enough for me to do it i love the atmosphere of this film and love the director jim jarmusch mystery train is one of those films that stay with you for many years after you ve watched it elevator to the gallows this image was originally commissioned by milan records france for a fantastic re edtion of the miles davis soundtrack to elevator to the gallows i had this perfect idea with the jacket cover and dust jacket but this will never happen as the folks at milan told me way too late when the art was finished that they didn t get the license to publish it after all being my favorite piece of the lot i just couldn t bring myself to not print it or show it to people so mondo was very happy to make it available as an art print and that s awesome i love this film noir movie if you have never watched it please do yourself a favor tucker the man and his dream i have a passion for vintage cars even moreso for vintage cars that has a retro futuristic look i first saw this movie when it came out in the late 80s and loved it martin landau has one of his best roles ever if you ask me i m not even going to talk about jeff bridges who is like in all of his movies great this poster image was originally commissioned by francis ford coppola s winery as they wanted it for their director s series wine label the art of laurent durieux part two is open to the public at the mondo gallery located at 4115 guadalupe street in austin texas posters that don t sell out during the gallery s initial run will go on sale online at a later date,Real
