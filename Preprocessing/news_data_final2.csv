abhinandan sekhri to be canonised by vatican,post his confirmation that jesus christ and prophet muhammad were indeed historical figures vatican released a press statement acknowledging abhinandan sekhri s contribution to further the evangelical mission it is already in the public domain that abhinandan had doubted krishna s existence but acknowledged both christ and muhammad were historical figures the office of pope is even considering to canonise abhinandan sekhri if and when it happens sekhri would become the first saint to be declared so while living on earth the saint of india one official who was very very close to the pope but preferred to be anonymous said this decision was a conscious one subject to one condition though the informer refused to spell out the exact condition for sekhri to become a living saint he referred to the issue of christ s birth and death apparently vatican considers sekhri as the reincarnation of one of the three wise men who travelled to jerusalem to greet the infant christ when asked what is new in sekhri s statement that christ was a historical figure the pontiff laughed it is true that christ was a historical figure however there always was a certain myth around his birth and death we hope abhinandan sekhri to use his good analytical skills and remove this myth however the former vatican man who wanted pope to resign from his post sent a mail to us saying that this decision is only to divert attention of the world media from the continuously popping up of various sex scandals involving many bishops and all kinds of human beings from kids to old men and women apart from the diversion canonising someone from india or china would also help the church in its evangelical mission of harvesting souls after goa inquisition the conversion rate of indians has fallen to a very slow rate despite lures ranging from rice bags to study sponsorship in the western countries the rate of conversion remained low not even canonising teresa could accelerate the growth rate of conversion so the church is toying with the idea of having a living saint efforts to reach sekhri for his response have failed newslaundry office however has replied that sekhri is on a very important tsk of converting mythology into history and can not be disturbed,Fake
aap evolves caste politics,like the congress party and the bjp the new political party aap has also not been wholly detached from advancing the caste factor in the electoral politics it can not be told that the aap is under stress because it keeps touching the traditional caste factor in its party politics former aap leader ashutosh has accused the party of having tried to invoke caste sentiments by using his surname during the 2014 elections afterwards another prominent leader atishi marlena has dropped her exceptional surname because it sounded more like a christian name marlena is the last name of atishi which is said to be a title mingling marx and lenin it has been emphasised that she has dropped her given name for some kind of the higher objective coming of a punjabi rajput family she became the party s first candidate for the 2019 parliamentary polls although her actual surname ends with singh yet she refrains using the last name simply to put a damper on the caste based politics was her christian sounding surname marlena averse to the caste based political setting she has made it clear that it was not been initiated under the party s pressure it was her own decision as she wanted to show her caste free face denying the influence of caste angle on his party the aap general secretary akshay marathe stated that our discourse was around healthcare and education not on identities of caste and religion taking the point even the aimim chief assad ud din owaisi said this was the reality of indian politics one could not have a muslim or christian sounding name to get elected naturally he took the time to study the caste factor in the politics and its effects over the clever political designs his mind definitely hangs around the politics which is fixed firmly on the caste connection,Fake

trying to snake charm buffalo,bhains ke aage been bajana proved correct in dewas when the domestic animal turned violent perhaps this biblical phrase was a kind of instruction to the people by jesus christ its meaning was usually taken as a useless effort or negligence that was what the congress party functionaries along with the anguished commuters wanted to portray at their protest site but their discomfiture in not knowing how to properly deal with a buffalo has come as a very poignant scene before them as they could not realise of the animal s aggressive behaviour all of a sudden were they so naive in playing the flute facing the animal with complete concentration when the congress functionaries started trying to snake charm a buffalo enraged buffalo hit them hard amid the cacophony the protestors ran helter skelter as the buffalo s fury was similar to spanish bull in the race their planning was just spoiled by the brutal behaviour of the buffalo they failed to read exactly what the cattle had in its huge mind the agitators started running for a safe shelter some might think in their precocious mind that the buffalo was a staunch follower of the bjp because of its excessive concern about its peer cow the congressmen thought their action was for drawing madhya pradesh government s attention towards delay in early approval of an inter city bus service between indore and dewas in mp however their garlanding and playing the flute did not secure ample approval by the particular cattle the moment it knocked down the politicians by its pointed horns there was utter chaos and commotion at the protest site the injuries were treated with the first aid facility immediately they soulfully thanked the almighty that none among them was seriously hurt what began with a political motive ended in a very sad note,Fake

didi s confusion between bisibela bath and blood bath,setting after working hard on pouring down various colours on her old white saree didi stood quiet and looked at the violent mix of all ghastly colours the white piece of cloth looked as if was used to clean a butcher s shop after used to clean tables in a mishti house how peaceful she wondered and congratulated herself for painting such a thing that was beyond imagination for any other ordinary mortal she walked to the cot that was made of bamboos and jute to match her simple lifestyle and rested she switched on the old onida black white television and panasonic vcr to watch her favourite recording a group of her followers clad in simple dhotis were counting the cash that was looted from the sadhana scam a blissful smile crossed her lips the video was a stress buster for her within minutes of watching she relaxes and sleeps sound twist after three minutes however the video got blurred and the b w tv screen was full of colours didi thought there was something wrong with the tv and wanted to tap it on the top so it can become normal don t get up the voice from the tv sprang as the vertical bars of colours transformed into colourful concentric circles zooming in and out simultaneously this is even freshening she said to herself and she remembered nothing the interview seeing her immobile condition byomkesh bakshi pulled the curtains and revealed himself he came straight to her and dangled a gold locket tied to a silver thread in front of her at the centre of the bangle are two emeralds shaped in the form of leaves fixed over a crescent didi was in a trance but liked it more and decided in her subconscious to make it tmc symbol her eyes were rolling along with the locket that was swinging like a pendulum byomkesh suddenly remembered the minny mouse that swung eyes like that at micky so didi liked the design of locket he decided to leave the locket for her after his mission in the voice of amrish puri when he was in romantic mood byomkesh asked didi do you want this locket didi yes bb what you will do with it didi i will make this tmc symbol bb this can be yours if you clarify few doubts didi ask

an old lady came with a tray and set up supper for didi seeing the food in front of her there was a sparkle in the eyes of didi yyaah blood bath she cried loudly and put the locket aside and started eating the old lady looked at didi with pity and left byomkesh slowly left the room and followed the old lady she heard his footsteps and turned to face him he introduced himself as a secret doctor and asked her what she had given to didi to eat she gave him a weird look and said it was bisibela bath part of kannada cuisine he blurted but she was calling it blood bath why the old lady heaved a sigh and said this was happening ever since she returned from bengaluru after attending swearing ceremony of kumaraswamy during the dinner bisibela bath was served and didi liked it very much before she wanted to ask its name pappu asked kumaraswamy what that item was already angry with the way he was forced to drink poison kumaraswamy said blood bath a speciality of karnataka and didi took it seriously she liked the taste of bisibela bath so much she was eating it for breakfast lunch and supper ever since she had not even touched fish for the last two or three months she became pure vegetarian and i too am now forced to eat bisibela bath thrice a day she looked sad so you mean didi referred to bisibela bath when she threatened central government about blood bath he probed further the point is her english is a bit poor the old lady continued in fact she was supporting nrc all she meant was once uncivilised people fighting on the streets would go away the fights on the streets would be between only civilised ones meaning only debates and arguments and no physical fights and everyone would eat the vegetarian bisibela bath and live happily forever a sarcastic smile passed over the lips of the old lady coupled with her poor english were her ferocious facial expressions and she communicated something that is entirely opposite of what she wanted to say omg byomkesh stunned at the explanation omg omg he repeated further the old lady slapped him as if to pull him out of shock there is nothing to do with god one should have control over language and body language as well byomkesh nodded in agreement would you like to have some bisibela bath she invited him to have supper with her yes mam sure i would like to taste the item that transformed didi the interviewer

can common game rooms for children in uttarakhand villages help reduce caste tensions,any mention of the hill state of uttarakhand brings to mind scenes of misty mountains clouds and to some even the earthy smell of marijuana but to those living in the rural interiors of the state the mountains are not a scenic escape but an insurmountable nemesis that often keep them from availing basic amenities that city dwellers so easily take for granted take for example the easy availability for children to play games in their neighbourhoods growing up in cities with easy access to safe and premeditated spaces for studying and playing one can often forget that these simple amenities may in fact be a luxury in remote areas noting the difficulty three student researchers have decided to bring about a change by creating games rooms for children in remote villages in uttarakhand former jadavpur university students payal sarkar and souradeep chakraborty from kolkata along with ankaj kumar from ranchi university were working on their fellowship the two year programme required them to facilitate teachers and children of primary schools for better development of a childs growth and to create public system projects and they have been working in uttarakhands bagheshwar district for almost two years now for the same it was while working in the secluded pindar valley when they noticed the lack of wholesome educational and recreation avenues for children in the villages of the valley while villages and communities did have schools these were often in dilapidated conditions with limited resources and teaching staff and were focused entirely on stoic teaching of theory if so children need more than just book learning to truly develop their personalities we wanted to introduce recreation as a form of personality development where children can enjoy a more holistic approach to learning said payal sarkar a former student of international relations she added that allowing children safe spaces for positive exploration of creative interests was important to their mental growth some of the villages that they have been working in have no motorable roads and can only be accessed on foot making resources very scarce darkness descends quicker on mountains and electricity is scarce leaving children with almost no options for recreation and relaxation at first the trio intended the games rooms to be built inside the schools already present in the villages but the idea was called off and the trio decided to make the games rooms in areas that are openly accessible to the entire community only a certain number of children go to school we wanted to build the games rooms outside of schools so that all children can access it equally even if they dont go to school payal said not all play providing a common space for children to gather and play discuss and participate in activities together is not just aimed at holistic personality development according to the young researchers rural uttarakhand continues to be bound by a stringent caste system that often exhibits itself in the form of social discrimination and boycott the problem is so pervasive that it seeps through even to the children for example souradeep chakraborty told news18 that in some villages upper caste children refer to those from lower castes as bimar sick many people do not allow members of lower castes to eat at their place even at a wedding lower caste guests are provided with rations and are expected to cook their own meal the problem of caste is deeply rooted and to weed it out one has to attack the very foundation sensitizing future generations is one of the basic steps toward ensuring that such injustices do not continue said souradeep he added that the community games rooms would act as a place for children of all castes and classes to play and enjoy together the trio also hopes that by bringing children together the common recreation centres would also promote healthy interaction between boys and girls many girls especially in rural areas continue to get married off as minors and often not allowed to mix freely in society after puberty or even continue their education young girls suffer various taboos including ones against menstruation payal has been trying to get the schools in the villages they have been working in to adopt a sanitary napkin vending corner for girl students and has also held sessions with children and parents regarding womens menstrual and sexual health ankaj kumar who has a bba degree and hails from bihar has taken career counselling sessions in order to tell both men and women the professional options available to them and guide them into making more beneficial decisions in future most children here grow up to join the army its the dominant profession here and women are married off early so they usually dont work ankaj said the career counselling is important both from a gender and caste perspective as both engender professional side effects according to the researchers most members of the scheduled caste were engaged in daily wage work and did not have steady jobs most of them worked as has and musk farmers with the community games rooms the researchers hope to at least generate a conversation and questions about oppression and discrimination among the youth instead of normalising it a hard task the trio has chosen three villages uniya sorag and khati all part of the wacham cluster in pindar valley to begin their first trial these villages have near zero cellular network and were largely cut off from the modern world at first the trio decided to first become part of the communities and understand their problems each adopted a village and underwent an immersion process in which they started living with people from the respective villages even working there they noted the schools in each of the village and started speaking to the village elders and teachers regarding the state of junior elementary and higher education in pindar valley after living over one and a half years of living in the district and closely observing the cultural and socio economic fabric of the area the trio decided to launch the campaign to improve the lives of children in secluded areas to start a conversation about creating recreational spaces for children was at first hard since most of the people were struggling to manage their incomes and other hardships that come with living deep in the mountains the three students first approached parents and children individually and slowly involved members of local bodies and stakeholders to get the work started in august gram sabhas were held by the three in all three villages which were attended by villagers as well as members of the gram panchayat following which they procured permission for the project the villagers have allowed the trio to use certain existing building to set up the game rooms however the three are still short on funding they have managed to raise about rs 25 000 souradeep said but they still need about rs 75 000 to successfully build three games rooms and are still running an online fundraising campaign for the same deciding content for the games was also challenging as it involved coming up with ideas involving everyday things that would easily be available on the secluded mountains we designed the games in such a way that anyone could play them anywhere they dont require any boards or dices payal said one such game is a local adaptation of chinese whispers another involves sketching souradeep also has plans to create a book of illustrations that would contain stories told to him by villagers he wants to print the book in several languages including in the local tongue danpuriya he has been collecting stories for months now and felt that the book would help bring out the personal lives and hardships that these remote populations suffer if the first trial is successful the trio plan to take the project forth at a state level and expand to creating library corners and other creative spaces for the young in remote areas,Real

opinion bad news for dmk too as aiadmk abandons anna for amma,a defining trait of dravidian politics is the quest to wrest the legacy of a departed leader it s not just a symbolic emotional quest but one that defines the very existence of a political party like the all india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam aiadmk since its inception the aiadmk never created the post of president in the party and the highest post within is that of the general secretary this was because the late mg ramachandran who broke away from the dravida munnetra kazhagam dmk and founded the aiadmk in 1972 asserted that his eternal leader was dmk founder cn annadurai and hence the highest post in the party was symbolically eternally left for anna mgr left the dmk following differences with m karunanidhi who took over as president of the party and chief minister after anna passed away in 1969 and had to reassert that he and his party represented the true principles of the dravidian movement as claimants to the anna legacy in effect both karunanidhi and mgr represented the same political ideology of their mentor before the electorate it was only a bitter personal rivalry that was a defining difference this and not just the influence of cinema is the genesis of the personality oriented politics in the state cinema did fuel the rivalry and help build the personalities but the reason the rivalry and personalities are so fiercely projected in the state is because without the personality rivalries the aiadmk versus dmk battle has no foundation in other words there is no scope for an ideological difference or debate as both would be on the same side the rivalry had to be intense to fuel political differentiation and it manifested itself through the twists and turns over the last five decades most recently it was this battle for anna s legacy that led to the dispute over granting a final resting place for m karunanidhi next to cn annadurai s memorial at the marina beach since mgr was buried on one side of the anna memorial it was imperative for the dmk to ensure that karunanidhi was buried on the other side to symbolically assert their departed leader as the political heir to anna the aiadmk dispensation tried to deny that space but lost the battle in the madras high court now a renewed dmk under mk stalin s leadership is reasserting itself as the only custodian of dravidian political principles of annadurai and there seems to be no powerful counter to that claim from the aiadmk the ruling aiadmk faction in the state is fighting its battle within the party for the amma legacy it is desperate to establish itself as the true custodian of jayalalithaa s legacy and that claim is being challenged by rebel leader ttv dinakaran who split from the aiadmk to launch his own party the core of the power struggle between the two sections is to wrest the amma legacy and establish themselves as custodians of it the winner in this battle in an election would claim to be the heir to the late jayalalithaa while their objective is to capture power in the state like in the past in the eyes of the electorate they have no other explanation or narrative for political existence but this battle is within the aiadmk as a party and not with a political opponent outside of it the factions are similar in character and represent the exact same political thought feeding on the battle for legacy as a narrative for political existence the problem is that the aiadmk in search of an amma legacy does not have a leader of stature to challenge the dmk s claim to represent the anna legacy though jayalalithaa was not from the same vintage as mgr or karunanidhi she had the stature to reiterate the aiadmk s position as a challenger to the dmk but after her demise there is no other leader to carry forward that challenge arguably the reason the aiadmk has survived is because jayalalithaa was in power when she passed away and the party is surviving on the remnants of that victory in fact no other political party in the state barring mdmk leader vaiko has the stature to challenge the dmk as the most powerful custodians of the anna legacy this is dangerous not just for the aiadmk but for the future of dravidian political ideology itself as it is the quest for the anna legacy that is the bedrock of the political narrative which remained between the two dravidian parties in tamil nadu and it is because of the dominance of the aiadmk versus dmk personality battle that there was no space for any other political ideology to evolve in the state in this backdrop when there is no challenge to the dmk narrative as the custodian of core dravidian principles the field is thrown open for a counter ideological force this is what the next election in tamil nadu will test and decide the smaller question would be which of the aiadmk factions will wrest the amma legacy but the more significant question would be whether the battle would continue to be fought among those who claim to be custodians of an anna legacy or will it eventually turn into one between an anna legacy and an opposing political force that has nothing to do with that legacy or even opposes it on an ideological level the answer to that question would lie in how the aiadmk recovers and if it does not which political force will occupy the space of opposition to the dmk in fact this would be important even for the dmk from a long term perspective having an ideological opponent in the electoral fray is something the party has not experienced in the last four decades and hence it may have to see the collapse of an aiadmk with worry instead of jubilation,Real

was ready some would call this arrogance others diffidence in either case it didn t make the leadership manual in the present context rahul is said to be working on a two fold strategy to take on the bjp the short term plan for 2019 is designed with the sole purpose of checkmating prime minister narendra modi at any cost in other words in rahul s scheme of things it means being the smaller partner in some states during the coming round of general elections rahul s sense is that non nda opposition parties are rather unanimous in not projecting any leader against modi for they realise that to do so would be to fall into the bjp s trap the non nda opposition leaders feel that despite all their potential and promise no young or seasoned leader from the opposition is in a position to match modi it s better to fight him on issues priya quotes tejashwi yadav and jayant choudhury as saying this is how we will cut them nda down to size we will not talk about personalities it s not one personality taking them on in up you have me akhilesh and mayawati if all of us come together and say the same thing then it s a strategy of encirclement rahul s long term goal for 2024 is different the congress president hopes to establish himself as a credible prime ministerial face by then priya thinks rahul will gain from 12 states including rajasthan madhya pradesh haryana maharashtra and gujarat which will help the congress improve its tally in 2019 if the congress crosses the hundred mark she argues rahul s short term plan will be in practice giving the congress a relevant role in any anti bjp coalition or as a more sure footed leader of the opposition in parliament the contenders offers interesting debate around youth in indian politics vir sanghvi in his usual candid style points out how most young politicians in india are actually older than david cameron who was 47 when he stepped down as prime minister of uk put bluntly india is a country of the young ruled by the old and the very old something like 50 per cent of india s population is in its twenties and 65 per cent of the population is under 35 yet you will search in vain for a single minister who is under 35 in most indian cabinets sanghvi says while giving a rationale that it has something to do with the circumstances that prevailed when india won independence in 1947 the leaders of the newly free nation were people who had led the struggle for liberation from the british because it had been a long hard battle they were already quite old or at the very least middle aged by the time they took office in the first government of free india rahul s long term goal for 2024 is different the congress president hopes to establish himself as a credible prime ministerial face by then,Real
trs facing the heat on campaign trail but brand kcr might come to the rescue,last week a former trs minister in telangana who was campaigning ahead of the assembly elections in the state was gheraoed by a mob of farmers the angry crowd stopped his car and refused to listen to him what followed next was a halt in the campaign due to the chaos the incident happened in wanaparthy district in telangana the farmers wanted an assurance from the minister that adequate water would be provided for irrigation this is not the first time jupally krishna rao minister for rural development was mobbed by people previously he had to get on top of his car to pacify the angry crowd in the last one month there have been at least seven such incidents where telangana rashtra samithi trs leaders have faced backlash while on campaign trail with villages taking oath to boycott elections and asking leaders to sign a bond saying that the promises would be fulfilled the ruling party leaders are facing the heat earlier this month a farmer from narnoor mandal in adilabad district committed suicide due to crop failure her husband had to carry her on his shoulders to cross a stream to reach the hospital sadly the woman died a week later residents of the mandal protested with banners saying no roads no bridges then why vote do not come to our village asking for votes in another incident people from wardhanapet in warangal protested against the local trs candidate aroori ramesh for lack of development slogans were raised saying you have no right to ask for our vote these incidents are definitely a setback to the party ahead of the elections in december with the anti incumbency factor gaining momentum it is not going to be an easy ride this time say analysts but will caretaker chief minister k chandrashekar rao s image come to the rescue probably yes say political analysts in the state at the grassroots the local leaders performance might not be satisfying but trs will have an edge due to kcr and his brand name prof nageshwar rao a political analyst told news18 the chief minister time and again has expressed confidence that the party would easily win at least 100 of the 119 seats he had also said last month that the trs had fulfilled all the promises made in the previous manifesto what came as a relief and a boost to the trs candidates is the partial manifesto released last week the manifesto this time includes allowance for unemployed youth a higher pension pay apart from the loan waiver analysts believe that the latest promises will give the campaign a boost and help the candidates in fielding questions on the ground also the opposition has not been able to galvanise the discontent into an anti kcr narrative which is another advantage of the trs apart from the chief minister s flamboyant image adds nageshwar rao what worked well for kcr in 2014 was the separate telangana agitation the fight for a separate state in which he was at the forefront helped him gain support from masses but now the situation is different the focus is on the promises made and how much of it has been a reality the questions is are people of the state ready to give kcr another chance most likely yes say analysts the anti kcr narrative is building but i don t think that is the situation as of now added nageshwar rao telangana will go for polls on december 7 and the counting will follow on the 11th of the same month,Real

bjp is now using goddess durga against me says kanhaiya kumar,patna former jawaharlal nehru university students union president kanhaiya kumar has shifted focus from delhi to bihar after the communist party of india cpi informally announced to field him from the begusarai lok sabha constituency which is also his home district in the next general elections camping in begusarai he could be seen inaugurating kabaddi tournaments attending religious functions and seeking support for the october 25 bhaajpa bhagao desh bachao rally to be held at the historic gandhi maidan of patna however controversies continue to dog kanhaiya during his bihar sojourn he has already been booked on three accounts intimidating doctors and creating ruckus inside aiims patna attempt to murder and inciting riots around a durga puja pandal in begusarai and hurting religious sentiments of hindus in his speech kanhaiya though is unfazed and prepared for the long haul he labelled the attack by the bjp to project him as anti hindu before elections the young leader spoke to news18 about recent controversies related to him and his political strategy here are the edited excerpts from the interview q you claim your convoy was attacked on october 16 at bhagwanpur in begusarai what happened kanhaiya kumar we were returning from mansoorchak after attending a rally i was attacked near dahia village under bhagwanpur police station area by the supporters of the bjps youth wing and the bajrang dal you can easily identify them they have uploaded pictures with sushil modi on their social media accounts the attackers were patronised by a local bjp mlc rajneesh the intention was to cause harm to me and my colleagues q is it correct that you were not stopped by them but you got off there to meet one of your acquaintances which resulted in a traffic jam in front of a puja pandal kanhaiya kumar no they are two different issues the puja pandal was behind us there was quite a distance between where we stopped and the place of the puja a police escort party was with us you can ask them q locals told me that your followers armed with iron rods and hockey sticks attacked them they also say that your comment on goddess durga was in bad taste kanhaiya kumar can you expect that a person who is starting out in politics will indulge in such things and that too in his own constituency these are all lies and those you are referring to as locals are not common people but workers of the bjp and the bajrang dal this was a politically motivated attack to tarnish my image and project me as anti hindu they conspired to vitiate social harmony and one of the guys who was beaten up is not an apolitical person but a member of the bajrang dal had we been armed then 40 50 people would have been injured not one q how can you be sure that they were people from the rss and the bjp kanhaiya kumar because common people in dahia village are least concerned about this the bjp workers are fanning the fire you need to understand the history of dahia village i know very well because my ancestral home is just about a few kilometres away some families there have been with the rss for a long time bhagwanpur chowk is the only stronghold of the bajrang dal in begusarai all their senior leaders were at the spot just after five minutes how can this be possible q what happened at aiims patna kanhaiya kumar we went there to meet our aisf colleague sushil the hospital says i was with hundreds of supporters who scuffled with security guards and i misbehaved with doctors now my question is where is the cctv footage what is the evidence if somebody was injured then where is the injury report see its a conspiracy the official facebook page of aiims patna describes me as anti national kanhaiya can you expect a government body to brand me in such a way the doctors who filed an fir against me are associated with the bjp q bihars health minister and senior bjp leader mangal pandey has warned you saying bihar is not jnu what is your reaction kanhaiya kumar sometime back the same mangal pandey said he is not aware about any kanhaiya kumar now he is saying be cautious its not jnu but bihar how was he able to identify me now i have not developed any family relationship with him the fir was lodged by the doctors against me at his behest mlc rajneesh touches his feet whose goons attacked me in begusarai q how can you say everywhere people are conspiring against you kanhaiya kumar this is for everyone to see lawyers were manipulated against me in courts doctors were influenced to file a case the vice chancellor of jnu was tasked to scuttle my phd and now the bjp is using goddess durga against me but i am not afraid q what is the difference between campus and electoral politics what is the kind of feedback that you are getting in begusarai kanhaiya kumar the people here in begusarai are clever no one can fool them when sedition charges were slapped against me then also they stood behind me none can mislead them i will continue my political journey following the rule of the law my opponents first tried to brand me as an anti national and are now trying to prove that i a goonda hoodlum i will continue to follow the path i chose in the jnu campus i will not compromise with principles they bjp were defeated in the jnu and will face the same fate in begusarai,Real

apple iphone xr review the colourful iphone that sets up many questions,let us start with a thought that you might want to chew on for a bit how important is the display panel type when you are considering buying a phone as in are your eyes perfectly tuned to figure out the difference between an lcd and an oled screen or maybe even the fine differences between different types of oled screens if your answer is on the lines of yes very important then you can safely move on to reading another article on this website however if you are leaning towards not too important as long as it gets the job done you might want to stick around for a bit longer what we have on the agenda today is the new apple iphone xr this is the return of the colourful iphones after many years yes the iphone 5c was a long time ago this was also expected to be the truly affordable iphone this year which would in many ways run a calming hand over the fevered brow of those who otherwise find the iphones too expensive the complication however is that unlike the iphone x last year and the iphone xs and the iphone xs max this year and so on you simply knew you were getting an upgrade across all considerations you may have with the iphone xr it isn t that simple this is an iphone that makes you wait and look at it and deliberate and that is not just because of its beautiful colour options the first thing you need to consider is the price the iphone xr is priced at rs76 900 64gb rs81 900 128gb and rs91 900 256gb this is what many expected correctly or wrongly would be an affordable iphone the price at which the iphone xr lands in india does have to factor in the fairly volatile currency at the moment as well as local taxes and what not which means it isn t what many hoped it would be the exciting colours that the iphone xr is available in make it tough to choose a favorite there is the sophisticated blue a subtle white a comfortable black a chirpy yellow a cheerful coral and the gorgeous product red to choose from the colours will make this iphone stand out in a crowd from other iphones and any other phone for that matter the design language is the same as the iphone xs which means it is up to date on the design front apple iphone xr 2 the iphone xr doesn t compromise on the build quality and instead the combination of glass and metal that you will hold in your hand clearly has the same apple esque precision that we have come to expect the attention to detail is best explained by the fact that the inside of the lightning port on the phone also adorns the colour of the iphone xr the slight shine that the glass layer adds to the back makes colours such as coral sparkle very nicely incidentally the glass used on the iphone xr certainly doesn t catch as many fingerprints as last year s iphone x apple doesnt exactly say who makes the glass but the changes this time around have worked well that said the moment you pick up the iphone xr it feels a tad heavier than you expect some of it has to do with the display technology some of it has to do with the materials being used but the extra weight is noticeable initially to put numbers in perspective it is 17 grams heavier than the iphone xs and 16 grams lighter than the larger iphone xs max apple has downgraded the water and dust resistance rating on the iphone xr it is ip 67 as compared to ip 68 on the iphone xs and xs max to ip 67 this means that the iphone xr will be able to take a dip in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes and come away unscathed as against 2 meters of water for 30 minutes which the iphone xs and the iphone xs max can survive it is hard to miss the thicker black bezel running around the display notice that the bezel around the screen is ever so slightly thicker than the iphone xs devices but a lot of that also has to do with the lcd display backlighting as compared with the oled screens apple calls the iphone xr s lcd display as liquid retina it would perhaps be unfair to compare this with an oled screen on the iphone xs yes while this has a lower pixel density and resolution than the oled iphones it is still touching 326 pixels per inch this is the same as all iphones apart from the iphone x the iphone xs and the iphone xs max anyone upgrading from any other iphone apart from these three should not notice any difference at all as they use the iphone xr for the regular daily usage as far as the brightness colour vibrancy and sharpness are concerned this liquid retina display does the job it is rich to look at text looks great photo editing is immersive and there are very minimal reflections only however look at the display at an angle and the colour shift is quite perceptible something that wasnt the case with earlier lcd displays on previous generation iphones incidentally this liquid retina display does not support 3d touch could this be the first indication of the beginning of the end for this feature hard to say but the iphone xr could be indicating the future it is quite positive that the iphone xr isn t compromising at all in terms of the power it shares the same innards as the more expensive iphone xs and iphone xs max the powerful apple a12 bionic which is the first 7 nanometer chip in a smartphone is the heart and soul of the iphone xr too that means itll have the same level of computing prowess when it comes to the artificial intelligence algorithms including for portrait photos ar apps and animojis the iphone xr also has the same truedepth module too apple iphone xr 4 the sameness ends when we flip the iphone xr around the rear camera the single 12 megapixel camera with the f 1 8 aperture and smart hdr it has the same image processing algorithms as the iphone xs which means most photos should retain the same brilliance and level of detailing however the big change is this is one single optical hardware instead of the dual cameras that the other two iphones have smart hdr is a great tool to have and the way apple have optimized it we notice that it retains much more detail in the shadows for instance while the rest of the frame doesn t get blown out there is no secondary telephoto lens and you ll probably miss it of you are used to taking a lot of photos on zoom for someone who has been spoilt with the 2x optical zoom on the iphone x and beyond this takes some getting used to the bigger limitations are experienced with the portrait mode while the iphone xs and xs max combine the data captured by the wide angle lens and the telephoto lens the iphone xr s rear camera portrait mode relies heavily on software as things are this only works if it can detect a human face in the frame no it won t get conned by pets or soft toys or statues or bobbleheads at least in our experience if you want to take a portrait photo of an object or a thing that won t happen the camera app will tell you no person detected while the iphones with dual cameras have five portrait photography and editing modes the iphone xr has only three which means from natural light studio light contour light stage light and stage light mono the iphone xr eliminates stage light and stage light mono since there is no secondary optical hardware to provide additional photography data for these to work however you do get complete depth control which can be edited using the slider the same as the iphone xs and iphone xs max there are times when the software struggles a bit to do consistent mapping of the subject and edge detection struggles a bit whether you buy the iphone xr or not does not depend on the display or whether this offers a performance compromise instead it will totally hinge on whether you need the secondary rear camera for portrait and zoom photos if you are okay with the limited portrait mode and really like the yellow blue product red or coral colours the iphone xr is absolutely worth the experience but there is still the iphone x to consider and whether you really see value in an iphone xr over even last year s iphone x dual camera and very powerful a11 bionic chip to say that the iphone x is still an excellent iphone is surely a massive understatement,Real

pixelgate google pixel 3 and pixel 3 xl reliability issues just don t seem to stop,the google pixel 3 and the pixel 3 xl can not seem to catch a break as it turns out google s latest smartphones have some serious reliability issues one of the problems being reported is the familiar speaker buzzing a lot of early adopters are taking to social media platforms including twitter to suggest that the bottom speaker on the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 xl phones is producing a random buzzing noise mostly being reported by users to be audible at mid range frequencies being played back at low volumes it is not immediately clear whether the louder audio drowns out the sound or eliminates it altogether as you push up the volume the speaker lightly buzzes from 500 2500hz and buzzes very loudly at 20 500hz higher volumes can drown out the buzz but its still audible whereas lower volumes can make things almost unlistenable just typing on gboard and tapping through the ui creates a very noticeable buzz reports a user qtpa2tnh on reddit and he owns a pixel 3 xl this is the second issue to befall the speakers on google s newest phones earlier it was reported that the two speakers on the new pixel phones don t have the same audio output levels though google did take to reddit to clarify that this is by design it hasn t assuaged the fears hi all this is by design we specially designed speakers that allow for louder sound 40 louder than last year and better low frequency response we use new amplifier technology with advanced speaker protection algorithms to push these speakers harder and really get every last bit of performance out of them we also worked closely with the expert tuning of a grammy award winning music producer to enhance the audio in a way that plays to the strengths of the hardware system however users are not convinced i initially thought the top speaker was busted but no its just noticeably quieter than the bottom one said a user with the handle rayw reddit pixel 3 xl owner here i can confirm the imbalance is real the bottom speaker is much louder and better with bass and the top is definitely softer and slightly better with treble it doesnt bother me much if i tell myself google did that intentionally but why call them stereo asks another user mcnick0495 and it isn t just the buzzing speakers which are the problem for the new pixel phones a lot of users are reporting an issue with memory management on the new pixel phones apparently the background process for certain apps that are being used at the time get stopped if the user switches to another app temporarily this could be quite nasty with music or video streaming apps for instance this could be an issue with very aggressive process killing or the fact that the phone isn t holding more than a couple of apps temporarily in the ram at any given point of time that said google s decision to have 4gb of ram in the new pixel phones is surely not the reason for this but something more on the lines of poorly optimized task management the final trouble that users are reporting with the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 xl phones is that sometimes they do not save photos that you may have clicked using the default camera app this is despite the fact that a little preview appears at the bottom of the screen once you tap the shutter button suggesting the photo has been saved when it actually doesn t show up in the list of photos later it is not immediately known if this is a camera bug or an issue with how the photos app integrates with the camera on the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 xl this is a bit unfortunate considering how the pixel 2 xl phones from last year also struggled with certain issues such as speaker buzzing and a very muted display the magnitude of any potential hardware or software problems just gets expanded since the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 xl are largely running the same hardware except the differing display sizes for instance which wasn t exactly the case in the past year,Real
teens and europe are giving up on facebook but instagram is the surprise gainer,the tough year for facebook shows no signs of abating there really is no getting around the fact that people are leaving facebook perhaps as a fallout of all the scandals which have dented consumer confidence significantly teens are giving up on facebook those above the age of 50 simply don t understand how it works and europe is set to give facebook even more headaches according to estimates by financial services firm morgan stanley facebook s user base in europe may have stumbled by as much as 1 million owing to the new general data protection regulation gdpr which kicked in over the summer this would be a direct result of facebook requiring hundreds of millions of european users to either opt in to having data collected as per the new gdpr rules or stop using the site however in the midst of facebook s turmoil its sister app instagram is the big gainer the latest numbers shared by investment banking and asset management firm piper jaffray suggest that facebook s sister social network instagram has seen a spike in popularity and it is also hurting its biggest rival snapchat along the way the piper jaffray taking stock with teens survey numbers suggest that 85 percent of teens use instagram at least once per month compared with 84 percent for snapchat the instagram numbers are up from 81 percent same time last year though snapchat has also seen an increase from 82 percent in the same period of 2017 last month numbers released by pew research suggested that a whopping 44 percent of those ages 18 to 29 in the us suggest that they have deleted the facebook app from their phone in the past one year pew has surveyed 3 400 facebook users in may and june this year surely the cambridge analytica scandal which became public knowledge earlier this year would have been fresh in the minds of facebook users however it is a bit more complicated than that the research also suggested that 26 percent of the survey respondents confirmed to having deleted the facebook app 42 percent said that they were temporarily taking a break from the social media platform and 54 percent have adjusted their privacy settings there is another big challenge for facebook a lot of its users simply don t understand how the news feed works pew research 53 percent of us adults who use facebook do not understand how the news feed works how the content that they see is chosen to be there and why some content is given priority over other posts the same research suggests that only 38 percent of respondents above the age of 50 understand the dynamics of the facebook news feed they don t feel like they have a lot of agency or control over the content that they are getting and many of them have not actively attempted to change or shift that content that s particularly true for older users said aaron smith pews associate director of research on internet and technology issues in an official statement,Real

juventus too good for manchester united on ronaldos return,cristiano ronaldo emerged victorious again on his second return to old trafford but this time did not get on the scoresheet as juventus outclassed manchester united to win 1 0 in the champions league on tuesday instead ronaldo played a supporting role by helping set up paulo dybalas winner on 17 minutes as the italian champions opened up a five point lead over united at the top of group h jose mourinhos men were handed a break before kick off as valencias 1 1 draw away to young boys means united still hold a two point lead over the spaniards but a fourth defeat of the season will see speculation over mourinhos future increase once more but for a series of excellent saves from david de gea the margin of defeat could have been far greater too as any momentum united gained from fightbacks against newcastle and chelsea in recent weeks in the premier league faded away against one of the favourites to win the champions league ronaldo was given a heros welcome on his previous visit to old trafford with real madrid in 2013 after scoring 118 goals for united in six seasons between 2003 and 2009 to help the red devils win three premier league titles and the first of his five champions leagues the portugueses early days as juventus player since making the move to italy from madrid this summer have been overshadowed by a rape allegation made against him in the united states the five time ballon dor winner has strongly denied the allegation and been backed by his new club who paid 112 million euros 129 million for the 33 year old in july but the reception he received from the united faithful this time was far more muted with only a mild cheer raised when his name in the juventus line up was announced ronaldo scored the winner in a contentious champions league last 16 tie for madrid five years ago but this time played the role of provider for dybala to be the match winner his cross intended for juan cuadrado ricocheted kindly off chris smalling into the path of dybala to sweep the ball past de gea for his fourth goal in two champions league games as juventus dominated the rest of the first half only de gea stood in their way of killing the game off before the break the spaniard flew to his right to save joao cancelos fiercely struck shot then produced a fine double save to parry ronaldos free kick and swat away blaise matuidis follow up effort top scorer in this competition for the past six seasons ronaldo is still searching for his first champions league goal for juventus having been sent off after just 30 minutes of his european debut against valencia and subsequently banned for a 3 0 victory over young boys he couldnt have done much more with an effort that soared towards de geas top corner seven minutes into the second half only to see the united keeper produce a miraculous right handed save going behind brought out the best in mourinhos side against newcastle and chelsea to help ease the pressure on the manager but the hosts failed to threaten until paul pogbas curling shot from outside the box hit the post 15 minutes from time anthony martial also tested wojciech szczesny late on but juventus held out for a deserved victory,Real
aiff intent on restructuring indian football but road ahead remains unclear,ahead of the 2017 18 edition of the i league the biggest talking point among fans and experts alike was the fact that the all india football federation aiff had decided to keep the indian football team that featured in the fifa u 17 world cup together as the indian arrows in a bid to further develop the burgeoning talents yet perhaps the biggest elephant in the room the fact that the i league and the indian super league isl would be running simultaneously for the first time ahead of a major restructure of the domestic football system was not addressed at the time one year later and with the potential threat of an asian ban looming should they fail to unify the two leagues by the 2019 20 season the aiff unsurprisingly chose to address the issue head on let us look at the bigger picture we are talking about restructuring the league and we have a holistic plan for that where we are going to take all the leagues into account and make a better league structure so that india can perform better internationally aiff senior vice president subrata dutta said at the i league launch in new delhi on tuesday yet while it was refreshing to hear that the aiff were finally looking to merge the two domestic leagues there are a number of issues that must be addressed before the huge decision is finally taken earlier this year news broke of a fifa backed report that suggested an asian ban for indian clubs should they fail to come up with a unified league by the next season the report was refuted by aiff general secretary kushal das who stated that he was yet to receive any report from the asian football confederation afc and that a decision will be taken in due course complicated roadmap however coming up with a new system will be complicated to say the least considering the fact that an arrangement currently exists that sees the isl clubs get a 10 year immunity from relegation from 2014 onwards even though the fifa report called for a review of that and some other arrangements there is every possibility that it could be upheld even after it is evaluated by the necessary authorities this would mean that isl clubs will not be relegated from 2019 23 while i league clubs will be both promoted and relegated as the report stated that the new league must become a 16 team tournament by 2023 more tellingly this arrangement will see the majority of the i league clubs which include legacy sides like east bengal and mohun bagan among others excluded from the new merged league at least in the initial stages for his part dutta stated that it would be unwise to view the leagues individually as the plan was to eventually freshen up the whole domestic league system in india we should not analyse just one league we should include isl we should include i league and we should include age group leagues as well as think about the second division league since they all add value to football in our country dutta said yet to not view the isl and i league as separate entities given the differing natures of both tournaments is something of an exercise in futility one league has been in existence for only five years and has massive financial backing whereas the other began in 1996 as the national football league and features some of india s most successful clubs yet has never had the kind of exposure the new league did there s also the fact that i league clubs tend to enjoy better in stadium attendance something the isl has struggled with especially after the league began to run for longer than two months including the isl clubs in the revamped league structure makes sense given the amount of money that has been invested in them yet a truly holistic approach will be needed if the benefits of the reforms are to be enjoyed by all indian clubs,Real

aiff intent on restructuring indian football but road ahead remains unclear,ahead of the 2017 18 edition of the i league the biggest talking point among fans and experts alike was the fact that the all india football federation aiff had decided to keep the indian football team that featured in the fifa u 17 world cup together as the indian arrows in a bid to further develop the burgeoning talents yet perhaps the biggest elephant in the room the fact that the i league and the indian super league isl would be running simultaneously for the first time ahead of a major restructure of the domestic football system was not addressed at the time one year later and with the potential threat of an asian ban looming should they fail to unify the two leagues by the 2019 20 season the aiff unsurprisingly chose to address the issue head on let us look at the bigger picture we are talking about restructuring the league and we have a holistic plan for that where we are going to take all the leagues into account and make a better league structure so that india can perform better internationally aiff senior vice president subrata dutta said at the i league launch in new delhi on tuesday yet while it was refreshing to hear that the aiff were finally looking to merge the two domestic leagues there are a number of issues that must be addressed before the huge decision is finally taken earlier this year news broke of a fifa backed report that suggested an asian ban for indian clubs should they fail to come up with a unified league by the next season the report was refuted by aiff general secretary kushal das who stated that he was yet to receive any report from the asian football confederation afc and that a decision will be taken in due course complicated roadmap however coming up with a new system will be complicated to say the least considering the fact that an arrangement currently exists that sees the isl clubs get a 10 year immunity from relegation from 2014 onwards even though the fifa report called for a review of that and some other arrangements there is every possibility that it could be upheld even after it is evaluated by the necessary authorities this would mean that isl clubs will not be relegated from 2019 23 while i league clubs will be both promoted and relegated as the report stated that the new league must become a 16 team tournament by 2023 more tellingly this arrangement will see the majority of the i league clubs which include legacy sides like east bengal and mohun bagan among others excluded from the new merged league at least in the initial stages for his part dutta stated that it would be unwise to view the leagues individually as the plan was to eventually freshen up the whole domestic league system in india we should not analyse just one league we should include isl we should include i league and we should include age group leagues as well as think about the second division league since they all add value to football in our country dutta said yet to not view the isl and i league as separate entities given the differing natures of both tournaments is something of an exercise in futility one league has been in existence for only five years and has massive financial backing whereas the other began in 1996 as the national football league and features some of india s most successful clubs yet has never had the kind of exposure the new league did there s also the fact that i league clubs tend to enjoy better in stadium attendance something the isl has struggled with especially after the league began to run for longer than two months including the isl clubs in the revamped league structure makes sense given the amount of money that has been invested in them yet a truly holistic approach will be needed if the benefits of the reforms are to be enjoyed by all indian clubs,Real

kasautii zindagii kay of cgi flown dupattas and bad tv in the age of netflix,i was nine when kasautii zindagii kay premiered on national television despite being one among the countless ekta kapoor shows that had titles starting with k it nevertheless stood out for me in my juvenile head its story of star crossed lovers gave it the feel of a home grown shakespearean romance different from everything else that aired on tv then i remember watching it night after night until i could watch it no more today 17 years later i have long moved on but indian tv is stuck in time more garish and painfully uninspiring than ever when ekta kapoor first announced kasautii s reboot earlier this year the show s loyalists yes they exist rejoiced but a lot of us shuddered inwardly in 2001 a show like kasautii worked not because of its great content but essentially because indian audiences did not have many options however the world is starkly different today so is the audience and their sensibilities 10 minute long slo mo character introductions and cgi flown dupattas may have worked then but today they will be seen for what they are utterly ridiculous and will be called out too by the viewers who are largely a generation hard pressed on time that speaks its mind is known for dwindling attention and can not imagine a day in without netflix but ekta kapoor knows it already why do you think she launched her own streaming platform alt balaji otherwise trying to monetise the untapped potential in the indian web space she has been consistently populating it with original shows such as bose and home if she can put out such content on the web why discriminate against tv then it isn t just ekta though colors tv also has its own web streaming platform called voot which features interesting originals such as feet up with the stars and stupid man smart phone its television shows meanwhile are still lamentably limited to naagin which is now in its third season the horror and bigg boss now in its 12th season says it all interestingly despite global web streaming platforms wolfing a large share of the domestic entertainment space tv still is the most popular source of entertainment in india for it reaches even areas where the internet hasn t yet it offers content in regional languages a versatility which international media service providers are working towards but just because a clear divide is now emerging in who watches what is it fair to feed off it make viewers in jabalpur suffer through the saas bahu aur saazish type content on tv while simultaneously aspiring to grab the attention of the metro junta with content driven web shows so dear daily soap creators here s a request use new shiny bottles all you want but don t serve rotten old wine we may not all binge watch netflix or live in metro cities but we can tell also internet will eventually reach the remotest of india much like tv what then,Real
