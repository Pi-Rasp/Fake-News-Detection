They were not happy with our politeness and wanted to hear some cuss words,” he recollected.

Invest in a gun if you can afford it, especially the high society types. Carry a baseball bat in you car to start a road rage without provocation.

Bengaluru couple going for a weekend outing returns after spending quality time at different traffic signals,"Bengaluru: Prakash and Rita, returned from their weekend trip after spending quality hours at different traffic bottlenecks inside the city.
Prakash who has spent more time with Silk Board signal than with his wife Rita wanted to surprise her on their first anniversary. Alas, city traffic had some other plan.
The blame game started between the two after they realized, forget about the outing, it will be a struggle to catch their Monday morning office cab.   
“I could have taken her to a nearby bowling alley, could have cut a love shaped strawberry cake along with candlelight dinner. Yeh toh koi bhi kar sakta tha. Wanted to try something different,” said Prakash.
He added, “What was the reason for Rita to try all those outfits, do so much makeup. 2 AM (when we started) ko kaun check karta hai road pe tum kaisi dikh rahe ho. Yeh baar baar gaadi stop karke, selfie leke social media mein upload karne ka bimari, that’s what spoiled our plan”.
Rita has a different take, “My friends had warned me, two days is not sufficient to get out of Whitefield only.  Why did Prakash plan a trip like this? Mein toh yahan abhi abhi aayee hoon, he is staying here for last eight years”.
Though the couple did not anticipate the traffic correctly, their friends, colleagues and well-wishers staying in the city knew where they would be looking at Rita’s social media updates. They ‘correctly’ sent the couple bouquet, gifts marking the major signals as their address.

Buzzfeed writer who wrote '7 ways to keep relation' gets dumped by girlfriend for spending too much time in Article writing,"Mumbai: Oh, BuzzFeed. Sure, the website churns out some quality pieces. However, their clickbait headlines are an ongoing internet joke. Their ability to turn everything into a “top 10” list is extraordinary. Sometimes we don’t even have knowledge about kind of items they include in their lists. ‘7 ways to find if your GF is cheating on you’, ‘ 8 signs of you being in love’ and many more.
Harneet Ahuja has been a Buzzfeed writer for years and has continuously churned out some interesting lists. His last titled ‘9 ways to ask for pocket money’ went viral and parents almost filed a case against him. Harneet is a brave writer, a category which is seeing its number going down and down. He again created a buzz on Saturday with his article ‘7 ways to keep your job’. This time though, the article didn’t strike a chord with the youth which is already aware of ways to keep their job and work towards a brighter future. It didn’t stop at that, as Harneet had to let go his own job after his boss fired him for the lack of engagement on his piece. It is shocking to learn that even after knowing the 7 ways to keep one’s job, Harneet himself forgot to apply those principles in real life. Harneet’s loss has opened the eyes of many other aspiring writers as they are clear now that what matters in the industry is the ‘NO OF LIKES’ on the article and not the quality.

Rajnath Singh: People who make musical.ly videos will be given preference for a job as they require it badly,"New Delhi: Launched in 2014, musical.ly’s popularity has been increasing ever since. The app allows users to create videos of their choice using various filters and speed options. It hasn’t even been a year since musical.ly was launched in India and it already has more than 15 million registered users. Youngsters are spending so much time on the app that they don’t care whether they need a structured career or a job. The types of videos doing the rounds make one believe that they are shot by people having too much time on their hands.
But every negative aspect comes up with a blessing in disguise. The musicaly.ly registration number is helping the government to find out the unemployment rate in India and to track its behavior. From lip-syncing, vines, to dancing, stand-up comedy, and makeup videos, musical.ly has a huge pool of talent. Govt now wants to use the database to make sure that a person is actually jobless before granting him a mainstream govt job. The new process would demand the fresher candidate to show 2-3 videos recorded on the Musical.ly app to prove that currently he/she is not working anywhere else and are in a true sense the jobless community of India.
It appears that Musical.ly is to the Gen Z what YouTube was to the Gen Y. Even though the most common age group on Musical.ly is 12-25, it is not limited to that. Aged people are also making videos and they should keep making them in fact, because based on the latest government decision, they can, in fact, apply for the role of a fresher for any government vacancy. Musical.ly will soon become the Aadhar card of the job market. Show videos and take a job.",INDIA,Fake
Bartender hired by Petrol Station to meet demand for 30 ml and 60 ml petrol by consumers,"Mumbai: A petrol station in Chembur has replaced all its regular staff with bartenders from nearby bars. This has been done after several consumers came asking for really small amount of petrol from the pump operators. With demand dropping to 30 ml and 60 ml, the owner decided that bartenders will be better suited to meet this demand thanks to their expertise in measuring those amounts.
Speaking to Faking News outside his petrol pump, the owner Mr. Telaram said, “With petrol prices crossing 91, people could no longer afford to buy petrol in bulk so they started asking for smaller and smaller amounts. Now the situation is such that they are asking for petrol in millilitres and our machine is not equipped to measure amounts that small. We asked our employees to measure 30-60 ml by hand and give but they always ended up giving more petrol than what the consumer asked for. This was causing a lot of loss for me and I had to find people who can measure millilitres perfectly.”
“Upset with the losses, I went to a bar nearby and that is when this great idea struck me. I saw the bartender pouring exactly 60 ml without even measuring it and I knew he is the solution to all my problems. I immediately got a few more bartenders on board, paid them more than what they were getting, and now I can meet the exact demand of the consumers,” he went on to add.
When we asked if everyone is asking for these small measures of 30 and 60 ml, Telaram ji said ,”Oh no, not everyone is asking for 30 or 60 ml, there are still some daredevils who ask for Patiala Peg of 90 ml.”
Meanwhile, after hearing this news, the government has decided to levy additional tax on petrol to get it to the same level as alcohol. “Any place employing bartenders has to pay the same amount of tax”, a government official said.",INDIA,Fake

"To cut costs, Yash Raj Films to shoot movie close to Bellandur lake in Bengaluru to recreate Switzerland like snow","For the first time since inception, Yash Raj Films has decided that its next movie will not have any scene shot in Switzerland. Instead the snow capped mountains would be recreated in Bengaluru’s Bellandur lake.

When Mahatma Gandhi got up from his Samadhi on his birth anniversary,"India recently celebrated 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The day of 2nd October 1969.

However, the western world is deeply studying his philosophy of life. They are the real admirer of his life. Anyhow, they have the great respect for him.
But, few of the Indian people abuse him. It’s because they are ignorant. The people of Pakistan also abuse him. They say, he was Hindu leader. Because, these people have not dived into the life of Gandhi. Really, he was not in favor of two nation theory.  The Indian people accepts an idea or a fact only when it is accepted by the west.

All members of Lok – Sabha are celebrating. They are happy. Bapu inquires, why are they celebrating? Anna says, Bapu, thirty percent of the members are having criminal background.

Who should pay for destination wedding?,"After giving out commendable judgements in a series of important cases, the apex court has before it yet another crucial case. The question that is keeping thousands of millennials in guessing game is “Who pays for the travel arrangements in a destination wedding”? Is your inviter your sponsor or do you split the expenses? If you split then in what percentage and is GST split too? The case acquired a newly found importance after hundreds of weddings ended up souring more relations than creating new ones. While initially the matter was being resolved with mutual consensus, the lack of clear directive is leading to escalating chaos. On one side are hundreds of relatives, silent but grumpier with every phone call, waiting for their travel bills to be reimbursed. On other hand are wedding sponsors who, much to their shock and surprise, find themselves sponsoring much more.
In a historical Inviter vs Invitee 2018 case, the court will pronounce its verdict to an otherwise empty courtroom which will be live streamed to record number of viewers online. The case will reviewed by a bench consisting of 22 members after two of the judges were found to have conflict of interest. A few involved parties were available to express their grievances. One of the relatives said “we had to book expensive tickets on such short notice. When there was no formal expression of reimbursement, we thought it will be covered with baraat pithiya”. “However that amount was not enough even for the ride to airport”, he fumed.
Meanwhile the wedding sponsors too had their share of complains. ”With all these expenses of pre wedding shoots and arrangements in such remote places, we hoped relatives will support us financially. However their response was quite opposite. One of them put his travel bills and UPI id in the envelope handed to bride”. The case is also unique considering the breadth of judgements it has to give. Apart from the conventional inviter vs invitee, it has to settle expense distribution between bride and groom’s family and in some instances between the groom and his family. Although less severe, there are requests to give similar financial guidelines for bachelor party.
Considering how well the court has given judgements in matters of public interest in the past, everyone is expecting a sound fiscal strategy. The finance ministry could take a cue from it considering the circumstances.",INDIA,Fake

He is greedy, cunning, wicked & over smart. He has made our lives miserable. Therefore, our survival is now difficult. Thus, she then adds how he is dangerous.
INCREASE IN POPULATION OF HOMO SAPIENS
Due to the over population, the man is now moving towards forest area. Day by day, our area decreases. Therefore, we move towards villages. For water & food. Therefore, there is a direct conflict between us & the man. The man kills us. He sells our body parts. Thus, he earns lacks of rupees. But, sometimes, they catch us & send us to the city jails. They call it zoo. Thus, our lives become horrible.
THE WELLS IN THE FOREST AREAS

The salient features of the new policy includes:
The college teachers  should not waste their time doing research. In fact, there is no need of such research.( Compare with Oxford Uni.!)
The teachers must encourage the students to participate in other activities.Therefore,they should take maximum interest in various Mahostav. Such as Navratri-GARBA, Ganesh Mahotsav, Durga puja etc.Therefore, we should declare holidays in these days.
This policy also focuses on online education. Private universities & self-finance colleges are also encouraged.However,in few years,  government is going to convert all institutions into private sector.
The appointment of vice-chancellor.
The chief minister will monitor the appointment of vice chancellors.
.The students and teachers.
They must remain present as an audience in functions. Whenever needs be. Because, this will show strength of the political party.
Most of the politicians & the ministers run their own self-finance colleges. But, they do not have prestigious degrees. There is already a provision for such an Institute. This is known as “Smruti Irani Institute of Doctorates”. Thus, it awards degrees to these needy people. Only in six or seven days time. In addition, We are starting more such short term courses. These will award B.A., B.Com. Etc.
In addition,the minister finally says. “No student should fail in any of the examination. It is the duty of the teachers to see it”.

Beggar shares Aadhaar number hoping for one rupee from hackers,"Ram Sewak Sharma, the TRAI chief recently shared his Aadhaar number on twitter. Little did he expect such an act would snowball into a major controversy. Privacy activists deplored the move. Aadhaar critics claimed all his details have become public. Some hackers with mischief on their mind sent one rupee to his account through the pay to Aadhaar feature using UPI (Unified Payment Interface) apps. A beggar here in Bengaluru who was a mute spectator, to all this bickering, was inspired.
With 99% adults in India having the Aadhaar, It was no surprise Mr. Siraj Khan a beggar by profession had it too. With the government emphasizing on opening Jan Dhan Accounts for the poor, Siraj too opened an account in a bank near his slum dwelling. When he heard about the controversy about the sharing of Aadhaar number, he did not bother too much. After a few days, when the controversy seemed to subside, he heard something which was startling.
A life of Penury
Like all beggars Siraj lives by the road side, begging for food and alms. On days when people are benevolent he earns as much as 150 rupees. “It is not all rosy begging” He says. There are lean days too when he finds it difficult to make ends meet. It was always his dream to lead a comfortable life. Stricken with polio since his childhood, his right leg had been affected. He uses a wooden pole as support to stand. Unlettered and leading a life in the periphery, all he wanted to do was live a life with dignity.
Siraj knew the importance of identity proof and always carried a duplicate copy of his aadhaar with him. It is helpful when he has to deal with the police he says. A beggar like him who does not live within the confines of four walls cannot be expected to comprehend what privacy meant. When he heard that some people deposited one rupee in the account of Shri. Sharma ji, he knew he had discovered something worthy. He dreamt of not having to beg yet earning from people.
Modern Begging through Aadhaar
It wasn’t time yet for him to be able to share his Aadhaar, though. He says no one told him we can beg this way. He had to come up with a novel way of sharing his Aadhaar in such a way, people would instantly get to know he was a beggar and in need. After mulling all options he decided to get a placard made with his Aadhaar complete with a logo displayed prominently. He is a happy man now. Any Aadhaar critic or hacker who sees his placard does not leave him empty handed.",INDIA,Fake

"Supreme Court allows protests in Aeroplanes, but only during take-off and landing.","Prashant Bhushan, the man who made his career successful out of PILs had once again knocked on the doors of Supreme Court yesterday night.
As the learned lawyer personally called five senior most judges requesting an urgent hearing to avoid a constitutional crisis, all Judges assembled at the court in the wee hours of today.
Trying hard to hide his annoyance over being woken at the middle of the night, CJI asked Mr Bhushan, what the crisis was.
“The Constitution, that is fundamental foundation to our country is in danger, MeLord”, Mr Bhushan made a grand opening statement, beaming into the television camera of NDTV. “The Tamilnadu government, which is a stooge to the fascist BJP ruled Central government is closing down all the vents of Democracy. The Democracy in India is throttled and is gasping to breathe”.
CJI: Will you please stop the theatrics and talking in circles please. Come to the point and tell us what the problem was.
PB: Sofia Lois, one poor Tamil student belonging to minority community studying in Canada started venting out her frustration when she saw ‘Tamilisai Soundararajan’ president of fascist BJP’s state unit in the same aeroplane she was travelling to Tuticorin.   She expressed her dissent by shouting “Down with Modi, BJP-RSS fascist government”. Instead of appreciating the research scholar’s attempt to keep the noble symptoms of Democracy alive, Tamilisai complained against the young leader Sofia Lois.
CJI: So?
PB: Immediately after the plane landed, police arrested the innocent research scholar only because this girl from minority community raised slogans against the ‘fascist’ BJP government.
CJI turned to the Attorney General who tried to smile but failed miserably.
AG: Me Lord, Aeroplane is not Jantar-Mantar to shout and protest against any fellow passengers. What she said and whether it was for or against any person or government is not relevant to this case. The police are bound by the law to file a case against her and their action was validated by the court, when the girl was sent to remand. Of course, she got bail later, as per the law.
PB: I object your honour. The Accountant General, who receives his salary from this fascist government is behaving like a caged parrot repeating the lies spread by the BJP.
CJI: He is Attorney General, Not Accountant General. Even my salary is paid by the same government. Do you call me also a stooge?
PB shocked and was at loss of words. Before he replied, CJI asked him “What exactly you do want from this court?”
PB: A ruling from you that protests are allowed inside the aeroplane Me Lord. Only to prevent further misuse of law and arrest innocent female, minority scholars.
CJI: Do you think protests inside aeroplane should be allowed?
PB: Your honour, you only said that dissent is an essential vent in democracy.
CJI: So, you inferred my statement that everyone can protest anywhere?
PB: Not anywhere and everywhere me Lord. Only inside aeroplanes.
CJI inhaled deeply and sighed before pronouncing the judgement.
Ruling:
Hereby it is proclaimed that inside the aeroplane protests are allowed subject to following conditions.
One can only protest during take-off or landing. One shall inform the flight attendants his or her intention to protest so they can tie the hands backsides.
If the flight is taking off, protestor shall stand near the cockpit facing front. If the flight is landing, protestor shall stand between the loos at the back, facing the tail of the plane.
While protesting, the protester shall not fall down.
If the protestor falls, fine of ₹ One Lac be levied, which would be credited into the PM’s relief fund.
If the protestor sustained any injuries because of such falls during protests inside aeroplane, no relief from insurance company (even from personal medical policies) be provided.
Prashant Bhushan immediately ran to the podium saying “Objection Me Lord. You are simply scuttling the voices. I protest this judgement”
CJI turns to the police standing nearby and says “Take him into custody and send him to 15 days police remand”. Then CJI turns to Prashant Bhushan and says “Advocate Bhushan. I allowed protests only inside aeroplanes. Not inside Court Rooms. You may argue further when the police present you to magistrate tomorrow afternoon. Till then, Bye”.",INDIA,Fake

His act was caught just 2 days before his convocation and he had to speak the truth then as his roaming with the girl was caught on CCTV cameras too. The college had never allowed any student from the mechanical batch to fall in love with a girl.
And Sanil was the latest victim of the tradition-face-off. Sanil has been told to spend one full year in the college living a single life without any relationship as part of the punishment.",INDIA,Fake

Govt says that the Dollar will have to find a way to 'Atone' for its 'Alleged Actions' against the Rupee,"New Delhi: The rupee dropped 36 paise to 73.93 against the US currency in early trade Monday, breaking its three-day recovery trend, as crude prices rose amid weak macroeconomic data. A spurt in dollar demand from importers amid sustained foreign fund outflows also weighed on the rupee. The Finance Ministry has said that they are working overtime to ensure that the Rupee comes back to the average level which is acceptable to the economy.
On the allegations that the Dollar has totally overshadowed and molested the Rupee in the recent times, the ministry said that Dollar will find a way to Atone itself for all the alleged actions against the Indian Rupee. In fact, ‘Atone’ and ‘Alleged Actions’ are the favorite words used by people to support any movement nowadays. Farah Khan and Farhan Akhtar used it recently to condemn the Sexual Harassment case against Sajid Khan and many others in the industry as part of the #MeToo movement going on in India.
The Finance ministry led by Arun Jaitley is pretty sure that Dollar will suffer because of the ill-treatment it meted out to the Rupee and whole India is in support with the Rupee right now. On being asked what are the steps his government is taking in this regard, Arun Jaitley said that” The government can’t do anything in this regard and the cycle will take its own due course. The Rupee will have to fight against the Dollar on its own, only then can it become stronger.”",POLITICS,Fake
MNS to file Patent for 'Beating up North Indians' after Gujarat copies the model,"Mumbai: After the chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar expressed concerns against the widespread attacks on migrant workers in Gujarat that has sparked an exodus —the situation took another political turn — as the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee has now decided to stage a state-wide protest on Tuesday against the atrocities.
The beating up of North Indians was something new in the state of Gujarat as many migrants work there for years. But now that the violence has happened, MNS, a prominent party in Maharashtra has filed for the patent as they think that ‘beating up north Indians’ is their invention.
MNS will submit proofs in form of photos and videos to the court to prove that they have beaten more north Indians than entire India including Gujarat. Raj Thackeray has asked all his members to increase the violence and defeat Gujarat in this race to become anti-north Indians. According to Raj and his associates, MNS has been beating up North Indians since last 10 years, and Gujarat has just bluntly copied the model without paying any royalty.
Raj Thackeray also believes that it’s not only about the beating up of people, but its also about how well you beat, and what measures you take to make sure that the person and his/her family doesn’t return to the state. The matter is pending with the patent commission to make a decision to whether grant the so-called patent to MNS or not.",POLITICS,Fake
Amit Shah reduces his claims of winning 22 seats in WB after Bangladesh gives a close fight to India in the Asia Cup Finals,"BJP President, Amit Shah was seen hesitating when asked about the number of seats he was confident of winning from WB in the upcoming general elections. However, a few days back Amit Shah was quite confident of winning at least 22 seats in WB and had been very vocal about it too. What changed?
Political experts and psephologist believe that Amit Shah has lost the confidence of winning seats only because Bangladesh gave a close fight to India in the recent Asia Cup final.
“There are many Bangladeshis in West Bengal who now have voting rights too and they are not likely to go with BJP since it is too nationalist.

Earlier, during Gujarat elections, Mr. Surjewala had revealed that Rahul Gandhi is a janeudhaari Brahmin and a couple of days back he had revealed Brahmin DNA of Congress.
Explaining the decision to enter this line, Mr. Surjewala said, “First of all this will show everyone what a knowledgeable janeudhaari brahmin Rahul Ji is, secondly it will shut those people up who say Rahul Ji hasn’t worked a day in his life. Thirdly, it will increase Rahul Ji’s connection with the people, he will be personally in touch with all the people who will come to attend the katha.”
“Currently he will be doing the katha only in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh because elections are there he is already scheduled to be there to strengthen party base. Anyone from those states can book an appointment via our party website. However, in 2019 we will be accepting bookings from all over the country. The money collected through this service will be given to the lawyers fighting National Herald case party fund,” Mr. Surjewala added.

Sambit Patra praises Narendra Modi for reducing Awaragardi on Bikes by increasing Petrol Prices,"New Delhi: BJP spokesperson and news studio resident Sambit Patra has praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for rapidly increasing petrol prices in the country.
As petrol prices crossed 86 Rs mark in Mumbai, Mr. Patra congratulated PM Modi for his hard work towards ensuring safe roads for the Indians. As per Mr. Patra, high petrol prices are keeping hooligans off the roads, making them safer for everyone else.
Speaking at a Press Conference squeezed in his busy schedule of news debates, Mr. Patra said, “A lot of misguided youngsters spend all their time roaming around on their bikes, doing awaragardi, creating ruckus, disrupting traffic, wasting their valuable time instead of studying or looking for a job. Now with increased petrol prices, they just can’t do those things freely any more, they have to worry about the cost of petrol at all times.”
“This has made our roads safer, reduced traffic on the road as people now go out only when they absolutely have to, reduced accidents, even Mumbai roads are starting to look like wide 1 laned highways as people stay away from the roads thanks to the cost of going out in your own vehicle. In fact, I hope our government works harder to ensure petrol reaches new heights every day. This is all a vision of our beloved PM Modi,” Mr. Patra added.
When asked if the government is planning to reduce some of the taxes on petrol to reduce its prices, an irritated Patra said, “I am talking about taking Petrol to new heights and you want to pull it down? And as far as reducing taxes is concerned, aren’t you aware that Mr. Jaitley is back in Finance Ministry? You should have thought of these things when he was away.”",POLITICS,Fake
Laloo clears yo-yo test and declares himself fully fit after hearing rumors that he will be shifted to Max Hospital in Delhi,"Patna: Sometime back, the Delhi government revoked the license of the Shalimar Bagh branch of Max Hospital after the corporate medical chain came under fire for wrongly declaring a prematurely delivered infant- packed in a plastic bag, still breathing – dead. Max Hospital has been accused of marking up their treatment cost so much that it is almost impossible for a common man to get treatment there. But one can expect at least the VIPs or the political class to be able to afford such treatment. But we were proved wrong yesterday when Laloo Prasad too fainted hearing the cost of treatment and declared himself fit.
Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president and fodder scam convict Lalu Prasad yesterday surrendered before a CBI court in Ranchi. The Jharkhand High Court had earlier on August 24 rejected Lalu’s bail extension-plea and asked the RJD chief surrender by August 30. But he will be moved to a Ranchi hospital tomorrow which made the court to think that maybe Laloo Prasad is faking illness. So the judge gave orders of Laloo to be shifted to Max hospital in Delhi, whose cost of treatment is world famous.
Recently there was a rumor that a guy walking near the Max Hospital front gate sneezed there and the hospital gave him a bill of 2 lac Rupees. The cost of treating cough, cold and other simple illneses is as high as treating cancer in some other countries. Laloo Prasad, in fact, says that he can even clear the yo-yo test to make the court believe that he is completely fit and doesn’t require hospitalization.",POLITICS,Fake
Convert Teen Murti Bhavan to a designated protest place: Anna Hazare,"New Delhi: As Government mulls a plan to convert Teen Murti Complex to a museum for all previous PMs, veteran protester Anna Hazare has given his suggestion for the iconic complex in the heart of Delhi. Experienced faster Hazare has asked the government to declare it as the designated place for all fasts unto death to be held in the capital from now on.
Earlier, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had written a letter opposing any changes to the present complex as it will detract from Pandit Nehru’s legacy. Congress has been opposing any plans to change Teen Murti Bhavan but sources say they may agree to Anna Hazare’s proposal.
Speaking to the media at the site of a protest, Anna Hazare said,  “What Delhi needs is a good place for protests. Jantar Mantar is always so crowded thanks to thousands of useless protests that I never get a good place to sit there. Ramlila maidaan reminds me of Arvind Kejriwal and how he ditched me to start a political party so I don’t want to go there. Teen Murti Bhavan will be perfect as the location is good and there is sufficient area to accommodate dozens of my followers who would join me.”
“Right now, I can only protest during winters but at Teen Murti, I can protest indoors as well so summer protests will not be a problem as well. Then I can organize a fast unto death every month of the year. There are so many issues for which I have to protest so that will help me achieve my annual target of protests easily,” Mr. Hazare added.
Further, Mr. Hazare said, “If government doesn’t agree to my demand, I will start a fast unto death till they agree.”",POLITICS,Fake
Amrinder Singh shares copy of Rahul Gandhi’s embarrassing mark sheet to prove he was in school during 84 riots,"Defending his earlier statement that Rahul Gandhi not responsible for 84 riots as he was in school at that time, Captain Amrinder Singh today shared Rahul’s school marksheet to prove his point.
The move however turned out to be an embarrassment for the Congress President, as the marksheet revealed some not so good facts about his academics. (At the request of Congress party Faking News will not be reproducing the content of the marksheet.)
While speaking to the media Amrinder Singh said, “I saw that many of you were still not convinced with my argument. So I am sharing Rahulji’s marksheet. Feast your eyes on it and see for yourself. He was in school at that time so how can you blame him. So what if the marks are not good. At least he has the courage to share it, unlike those in power who have things to hide and submit fake degrees.”
“Rahul is the low hanging fruit for the media. For BJP he is punching bag. But I feel he has been misunderstood all along. It is preposterous to blame him for something which took place when he was 13 years old. I agreee some of his statements give an impression that he is still 13, but that does not mean you can attribute the riots to him,” Mr. Singh said.
Congress Party has however dismissed Amrinder’s statement and said that the party President’s marksheet is not for public consumption. “That is not Rahulji’s marksheet. How can he score 20 out of 100 in English. I personally did all his homework and helped him study during exams,” said a surprised Shashi Tharoor.",POLITICS,Fake
Rahul Gandhi to train under Mulayam Singh Yadav to deliver a speech which no one can understand,"Germany: Rahul Gandhi’s pit stops in the European powerhouse made plenty of news — for example, he brought up the example of the Islamic State’s formation while accusing the Modi government of excluding minorities from development.
He was seen at a food stall later. Not before giving the trollers some meaty material by the way of a collage taken at the German parliament. But the roof came crashing down when on asked about Doklam, he said that he doesn’t have the details of the issue. This is the same Rahul Gandhi who for last one year has been accusing the govt of playing it softly at Doklam.
The Congress party is really worried that if he keeps giving such speeches,  they may face the same consequences as in 2014. The best way to save embarrassment is obviously by not speaking, but even if Rahul utters some words, it would be better for Congress if people don’t understand those words. And taking a step in this direction, Rahul Gandhi will undergo training under Mulayam Singh Yadav for 1 month to utter words which cannot be understood by people.
Mulayam has given many controversial statements, but none of those statements were ever understood by the media. It was only after the media hired experts to decode his speeches that they were able to understand what Netaji meant to say. Rahul wants the same confidence which makes Mulayam speak on any issue without fearing anyone. And why should he fear when none of the words uttered by him are decoded by the press.",POLITICS,Fake
"Terrace pipe leaks at politician's house, politician does an aerial survey of the incident","Lucknow: At a time when torrential rains are causing havoc in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday conducted an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas in Lakhimpur Kheri and Gonda districts. In fact Areal surveys are becoming a fashion statement nowadays. Shwetank Srivastava, a UP MLA actually did a survey of his own house where a terrace pipeline was leaking.
On Friday Morning, Shwetank was told by his servants that the terrace pipeline was leaking and the terrace was filled with water. It needed immediate attention from a plumber. But then reputation was also at stake. At a time when ministers and MPs are doing surveys of flood-hit areas, it doesn’t make sense for Shwetank to sit quietly. And so he took a major decision. Shwetank called a private chopper and went on the aerial survey of his house. The chopper flew for around 50 minutes over the top of Shwetank’s house. The result derived after the survey was that a plumber is required to fix the pipeline and Shwetank asked his secretary to give him a full report of the survey findings.
In fact, a press conference was called at his house where Shwetank briefed the media about the Aerial survey and the need to go for it. According to him, an aerial survey gives a full account of the incident and also the fix required for it. As from the ground, it is not possible to see everything that is impacting the terrace. After looking at the incident, more MLAs have gone ahead with the decision to do more aerial surveys in future. The chopper industry is the one to benefit from such decisions.",POLITICS,Fake
We will end ISIS by making Baghdadi a Constable in Delhi Police: Rahul Gandhi,"New Delhi: Much to the relief of the entire world, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has promised he will end dreaded terrorist organisation ISIS once Congress comes to power in India in 2019. During a function in Germany, Mr Gandhi said that they will recruit ISIS head Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi as a Constable in Delhi Police, providing him a stable job and thus ending ISIS.
Earlier during his Euro Trip, Mr Gandhi had highlighted how lack of jobs led to the creation of ISIS, an organization that went on to unleash widespread terror around the world, and in Iraq and Syria in particular.
Speaking to a group of students, Mr Gandhi said, “We thought about various jobs for Baghdadi and concluded that a Police Constable will be the best post for him, a boring desk job may not be suitable for an all action Baghdadi. As a Police Constable in India, he can freely indulge in violence without any repercussions, of course he will have to stop killing people but that tendency will anyway get removed from his system once he gets a stable government job.”
“Our opponents in India can’t even provide jobs to Indian youth so there is no way they will be able to accommodate Baghdadi and his men in government jobs. They hate migrant workers as well so that is another problem in the current scenario. However, once we gain power in 2019, our first move will be to end global terrorism by advertising posts in Delhi Police for these people,” the Congress President added.
Congress is now expecting support from the entire world during next year’s general elections in India as they have promised to deliver a world free of terrorism.
Meanwhile, a confused and dazed Baghdadi was spotted in Syria asking his followers if all they needed was a 9 To 5 job.",POLITICS,Fake
"With Prohibition already in place, Bihar govt decides to stop water supply on 2nd Oct to celebrate dry day","Patna: The jury is out on whether the prohibition in Bihar has worked or not. The Nitish Kumar government feels that prohibition has led to more women participating in the election process, fewer incidents of domestic violence and crime against women. Though the latest shelter home rape cases have exposed the govt findings. One problem the prohibition law has caused is that of celebrating Dry Day on important occasions like Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October. But Nitish Kumar seems to have found a solution for that too. Yes, Bihar government has decided to stop water supply throughout Bihar to celebrate the dry day.
The prohibition law, which Nitish’s government brought within six months of coming to power in 2015 was only one, though perhaps the most potent, of the elements of his strategy to create and nurture a political constituency among women. And now with an innovative way of celebrating Dry Day, Nitish is really making everyone happy. There are strict orders to all municipal corporations to stop water supply from 0000 Hrs on 2nd October. Any corporation found supplying water will be strictly dealt with and the same punishment will be given which is given to the bootleggers in the current scenario.
Citizens have been told to store extra water on 1st October so that they don’t face issues on 2nd October. Any person found drinking water in public will also be given warning. This seems to be a great decision for the chai lovers in Bihar as on 2nd October they will get pure-milk tea, which is a rarity nowadays. Gravies in restaurants will be without water and use of tissue paper in restrooms will be encouraged on 2nd October.",POLITICS,Fake
Arvind Kejriwal on an overnight protest in front of Ashutosh's house following latter's resignation from the party,"CM Arvind Kejriwal, deputy Manish Sisodia, and Satyendra Jain are at it again! A rather silent hunger strike is being held by the trio, but this time not against the Center or LG but against the decision of their own party member, Ashutosh.
Ashutosh had resigned from the party yesterday, and if sources are to be believed, the reason for doing so is best known to him only.
Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia have spent the last night sleeping outside Ashutosh’s house, demanding cancellation of his resignation. Ashutosh plays an important role in the party and his absence will decrease the credibility of the party and will impact the party’s irrelevance in the current political scenario, where it is renowned for all things weird. Ashutosh is not only quitting AAP, but he has abandoned politics altogether.
Faking News reporter spoke to Yogendra Yadav, a former party member, and political analyst regarding Ashutosh’s abrupt resignation. Yogendra Yadav pointed out that Ashutosh was always meant to play a bigger role and if he has taken this decision consciously, unlike the way he tweets, then we must appreciate it. He further added that Ashutosh must return to journalism, which now has a dearth of good journalists who are ready to get humiliated and sometimes even slapped for reporting the truth.
It’s Arvind Kejriwal’s birthday today and party workers are confused where to reach to wish him. As news broke about the hunger strike, many AAP workers were seen carrying cakes and chocolates, marching towards Ashutosh’s house. But whether Arvind Kejriwal will cut the cake while being on hunger protest is yet to be seen. For more news stay tuned to Faking News.",POLITICS,Fake
BHEL to start manufacturing phones after heavy public demand,"Rahul Gandhi and gaffes are so interconnected that many people believe that Rahul Gandhi’s full name is Rahul Gandhi gaffe. Normally, it’s the BJP that gets benefitted from his bloopers, but this time, the heavy engineering centered PSU, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), is also going to reap the benefits.
Recently, while addressing a rally in Chhattisgarh, Rahul Gandhi accused Chhattisgarh CM Dr. Raman Singh of a scam and asked him why he didn’t buy phones from BHEL. CM Raman Singh has launched ‘Sanchar Kranti Yojna’ under which 50 lakh people will be given free smartphones. Trying to bring the people of Chhattisgarh into confidence, Rahul Gandhi got overboard and asked CM Raman Singh why he didn’t source these phones from BHEL.
Soon after the video got leaked on Social Media, users started asking for places from where they can buy BHEL made phones. What initially looked like sarcasm turned out to be a big opportunity for BHEL and the very next day BHEL announced its new unit in Bhopal that will start manufacturing phones before the end of the year.
Faking News reporter spoke to BHEL MD, Mr. K P Sharma. Mr. Sharma said, “See this is an opportune moment for us because when phone companies like Apple and Samsung are witnessing tough competition, people want to buy phone from a company that doesn’t even manufacture phones. So, obviously we are going to fulfill public demand and we have already started the procedure of installing a unit in Bhopal”.
This is not the first time when someone’s gaffe has become a boon to a company. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, while addressing people on his live Facebook, had talked about Bullet train ticket pricing and had estimated it to be as high as Rs. 75000. This estimate gave the govt, and also the Japanese company manufacturing bullet train engines, an upper hand in overpricing the tickets as people anyway would expect ticket prices to be exorbitantly high.",POLITICS,Fake
Police arrests person who was laying ‘Black’ colored tar road on Amit Shah’s rally route assuming him to be a protestor,"Kolkata: Three people, including two women, were arrested for allegedly waving black flags and jumping in front of BJP chief Amit Shah’s convoy in the Dhoomanganj area two weeks back. The protesters claimed to be members of the Samajwadi Party’s student wing, Dhoomanganj SHO Sandeep Mishra said, adding that they were arrested on the charge of breach of peace. A purported video of the incident showing police personnel manhandling the protesters went viral on social media.
Instead of learning something from the incident, police has, in fact, become more vigilant in dealing with the protestors. Today when Amit Shah was traveling from the airport to the central part of the city, there was a contractor who was laying black colored tar road. Though the color of tar roads across India is black, but this being on the rally route of Amit Shah, police took it as a protest and arrested the contractor. Contractor Shwetank Srivastava who was arrested from the spot has conveyed that all tar roads made by him are black in color and he was not protesting Amit Shah’s rally.
The incident can be detrimental in the already crippling infrastructure projects of India as contractors will think twice before taking the responsibility of making a tar road from now onwards. As the rally progressed, police arrested people wearing black colored clothes, riding black motorbikes, cars, and also people who were seen watching the movie ‘Black’ along the way of the rally route. There have been 30-35 arrests as per our report. Amit Shah meanwhile has come out and said that none of the arrests were made at his orders and that he believes in complete democracy.",POLITICS,Fake
Parliament Street closed for the day as MPs shoot their Kiki Challenge videos,"New Delhi: Parliament Street (Sansad Marg) in Delhi will remain closed for the next 24 hrs as all the Indian MPs are getting in on the latest viral phenomenon, the Kiki challenge. To make sure there are no traffic problems due to the challenge, Delhi Traffic Police has decided to close the road for all other vehicles for the day.
The “Kiki challenge” involves jumping out of a moving car and dancing alongside it to Drake’s hit In My Feelings, while the car continues moving. It has become an online rage with people from all over the world posting their videos executing the challenge.
Speaking to Faking News, an MP from Central India said, “This is just a way for us to connect to young voters. They will feel we are the true representatives of them if they see us doing stupid things for Likes and Retweets online. One MP came up with the idea while having the subsidized lunch in Parliament canteen and soon everyone showed interest in doing the challenge. There is nothing to do inside the parliament, at least we can achieve something during this Monsoon session.”
“All the MPs doing the challenge on the road could have created problems for the other commuters so we requested Delhi Police to make some arrangements. They have decided to close the road completely to make sure common people aren’t affected while we do our challenge,” the MP added.
A Delhi Police official while confirming the news said, “Actually, we just didn’t want the people to see their elected representatives acting like fools and then falling down on the side of the road in the process. They may have started wondering about the point of democracy itself.”
Meanwhile, BMC has warned Mumbaikars against trying any Kiki challenge stunt in Mumbai and has said that BMC will not be responsible if any resident falls into a pothole while doing this challenge.",POLITICS,Fake
'O Neta Kal Aana' Cryptic Message on Ganpati Posters scares the $#!^ out of Netas,"Mumbai, one random day: India, they say treats its guests with ‘Atithi Devo Bhav’. & where else does this adage hold truer than when Bappa arrives to the tunes of Bollywood item songs in Mumbai during Ganpati. There are brands glaring at you as you stand in the queue for your selfie with the tusked god and then there are NETAS! Yes, the Netas from BJP, Congress, MNS, SS, NCP, TDP, BSP, CPI, CPI (M), CPI (Ass) and what not. There are more parties in India than there are gods.
So coming to the point, the Netas look at with you with those droopy over Black Dog eyes and gleaming as pearl teeth. This incident highlights the plight of one of these spiteful brother-in-law to an ex-MLA’s PA who woke up to find that his brother-law’s boss’ poster was marked with a message ‘O NETA KAL AANA’. The font was Comic Sans. The brother-in-law of the ex-MLA’s PA panicked, the ex-MLA’s PA sighed, the ex-MLA fainted! & the chain grew. Within 2 nights, of 1764 Netas had their posters smashed by the same cryptic message – that is a total of 2,53,900 posters in total (97.8% of total Ganpati posters in the city). This was cutting across party lines and everyone from corporators, to PM, to dynasts and relatives were none spared. Some of those whose poster got smeared were followed by the PM on Twitter.
No arrests have been made so far, though some marketeers claim, Netflix is doing this to market the Season 2 of Bhavesh Joshi Superhero (speculation). Whatever be the cause, this has sent the entire political establishment in the city in a flurry & huddle. Never ever, ever never, has anyone dared to torment our politicos in a similar fashion since the time Arnab did RaGa.
Most though are happy. ‘O Neta Kal Aana’ has a verified Facebook & Instagram account and 1000’s fakes. A not Mr. Bagga has also introduced a line of T-shirts with faces of your most despicable Netas available for the message. According to fans, it was high time someone decided to troll the poster boys of public nuisance on their own posters.",POLITICS,Fake
Abhinandan Sekhri to be canonised by Vatican,"Post his confirmation that Jesus Christ and Prophet Muhammad were indeed historical figures, Vatican released a press statement acknowledging Abhinandan Sekhri’s contribution to further the evangelical mission.
It is already in the public domain that Abhinandan had doubted Krishna’s existence but acknowledged both Christ and Muhammad were historical figures. The office of Pope is even considering to canonise Abhinandan Sekhri. If and when it happens, Sekhri would become the first Saint to be declared so while living on earth.
The saint of India
One official who was very, very close to the Pope, but preferred to be anonymous said this decision was a conscious one, subject to one condition. Though the informer refused to spell out the exact condition for Sekhri to become a living Saint, he referred to the issue of Christ’s birth and death. Apparently Vatican considers Sekhri as the reincarnation of one of the three wise men who travelled to Jerusalem to greet the infant Christ.
When asked what is new in Sekhri’s statement that Christ was a historical figure, the pontiff laughed. It is true that Christ was a historical figure. However, there always was a certain myth around his birth and death. We hope, Abhinandan Sekhri to use his good analytical skills and remove this myth.
However, the former Vatican man, who wanted Pope to resign from his post sent a mail to us saying that this decision is only to divert attention of the world media from the continuously popping up of various sex scandals involving many Bishops and all kinds of human beings from kids to old men and women. Apart from the diversion, canonising someone from India or China would also help the Church in its evangelical mission of harvesting souls. After Goa inquisition, the conversion rate of Indians has fallen to a very slow rate. Despite lures ranging from rice bags to study sponsorship in the Western countries, the rate of conversion remained low. Not even canonising Teresa could accelerate the growth rate of conversion. So, the Church is toying with the idea of having a “living saint”.
Efforts to reach Sekhri for his response have failed. Newslaundry office however, has replied that Sekhri is on a very important tsk of ‘converting’ mythology into history and cannot be disturbed.",POLITICS,Fake
AAP evolves caste politics,"Like the Congress party and the BJP, the new political party AAP has also not been wholly detached from advancing the caste factor in the electoral politics. It cannot be told that the AAP is under stress because it keeps touching the traditional caste factor in its party politics.
Former AAP leader Ashutosh has accused the party of having tried to invoke caste sentiments by using his surname during the 2014 elections. Afterwards, another prominent leader Atishi Marlena has dropped her exceptional surname because it sounded more like a Christian name.
‘Marlena’ is the last name of Atishi, which is said to be a title mingling Marx and Lenin. It has been emphasised that she has dropped her given name for some kind of the higher objective. Coming of a Punjabi Rajput family she became the party’s first candidate for the 2019 parliamentary polls.
Although her actual surname ends with ‘Singh’ yet she refrains using the last name simply to put a damper on the caste-based politics. Was her Christian sounding surname ‘Marlena’ averse to the caste-based political setting?
She has made it clear that it was not been initiated under the party’s pressure. It was her own decision as she wanted to show her caste-free face.
Denying the influence of caste angle on his party, the AAP general secretary Akshay Marathe stated that our discourse was around healthcare and education not on identities of caste and religion.
Taking the point even the AIMIM chief Assad-ud-din Owaisi said this was the reality of Indian politics. One could not have a Muslim or Christian sounding name to get elected. Naturally, he took the time to study the caste factor in the politics and its effects over the clever political designs; his mind definitely hangs around the politics which is fixed firmly on the caste connection.",POLITICS,Fake
"Rahul Gandhi nominated for Nobel – in Economics and of course, Peace","Welcoming the latest insipid err… inspiring speech by Rahul Gandhi in the land of Hitler about the ill effects of unemployment, Martya Sen, the other Nobel winner in Economics wanted a Nobel in Economics to Rahul Gandhi too.
“It is refreshingly new idea!” Mr. Sen exclaimed flailing his hands in air in excitement. “Linking lack of employment to becoming terrorists is perhaps the most important observation made by any philosopher, thinker and a politician in the last century. In other words, Rahul ji has identified the root cause of the most devastating problem of the world – Terrorism. And, as Rahul ji explained, the cause was too simple despite the problem is so complex” he said with a smile on his face.
“After the famous Panch Sheel theory proposed by Pandit ji, no Indian could come up with such a lucid theory to address problems of the working world. Though Indira Gandhi’s ‘Garibi Hatao’ was a good slogan, it lacked the depth of understanding so could not qualify to become a philosophy in itself” he added. When one of the reporter wanted to explain this lengthy statement on Indira Gandhi, Martya laughed and advised him to listen to the caption in loop for 100 times. “It is a cryptic statement and only the intelligent like Rahul ji can comprehend it in the first instance”, he explained his advice but not his statement.
“Consider a world where everybody is having a job to do. If everyone is busy in their jobs, from where one can recruit terrorists. It would difficult to recruit even the ordinary stone-pelters. The solution Rahul ji proposed would solve both unemployment and terrorism, biggest two problems of the world. So, he deserves two Nobels, one for Economics and one for establishing World Peace” he concluded.
Seconding the nomination by Martya Sen was Bakra Baghdadi, inspirational leader of ISIS. He concurred with Rahul’s explanation of “unemployment created ISIS”. “Back in those days, all jobs in Arab countries were done by American expats and Indian workers leaving the native population with nothing to do but fighting. That was what we used to do. Even before ISIS came into existence, there were Saddam, Qaddafi who were providing employment to native Arabs by recruiting them into armies. Suddenly Amreecans came and the job market vanished in the desert storm. So, Osama had to take it upon himself to provide employment to our people. Later on, we took it over from him and expanded the job market” Baghdadi explained. Beaming with pride he continued “Now, our workers are so skilled they migrated to entire Europe and are one of the major workforce in Germany and France”.
When contacted over email, Germany chancellor Merkel had agreed with Bakra Baghdadi and accepted that the migrants from Middle East are fusing the Europe in the most sharp and pointed way, where otherwise the life was very dull.
Summarising all the views from all the places, Barkha Dutt too added her own experiences with misguided children of Kashmir, particularly the sons of school masters were turning into terrorists. The way Rahul Gandhi could express his opinion so effervescently, I could sense his confidence had increased more than that of Narendra Modi. If he gets these two Nobels before elections, chances of Mahagathbandhan forming a government in 2019 increase manifold, she opined.",POLITICS,Fake
Rahul Gandhi accuses BJP of practicing Black Magic,"Agitated at being humiliated by the BJP’s top brass time and again, Rahul Gandhi, Entertaining President of Congress accused BJP in strongest of the language and his main target was Amit Shah.
Recently, during his speech, the microphone malfunctioned. As he was deeply into the speech, Rahul had to shout so his voice could be heard to the backbenchers and it strained his already strained voice. In a fit of fury, he declared that the microphone was switched off by Amit Shah. “Amit Shah can’t digest I convey my thoughts to you so you all be happy. He was a sadist who wanted to project me as a Pappu” Rahul Gandhi vented out his frustration.
“They asked me to close my eyes like this”, said Rahul Gandhi
After sipping a peg of Corex, he continued in the voice that sounded almost like an iron sheet being scratched by nails. “You all know I went to the famous Doon school. You all know I went to the Cambridge University. You all know I have travelled length and breadth of the world – from Thailand to Bahamas. And, you all know how many blunders I make in public life”.
Pushing up his long sleeves to expose his hairy arms, he forced red streaks into his otherwise dazed eyes and took a deep breath. “Yes. I committed many blunders. I talk nonsense most of the time. How can a Cambridge educated guy commit such gaffes? Is it possible? Despite being chaiwala, even Narendra Modi doesn’t commit these many silly mistakes.   So, why was I making so many mistakes” he questioned the audience.
Meanwhile the electrician wearing Orange scarf walked to him and took the mic and switched it on muttering “Maybe you are always on high”. The mic started functioning. Rahul Gandhi sighed loudly and the noise wrapped entire meeting hall that everyone present there felt Rahul Gandhi next to him.
Rahul continued “See, even now I switched the mic off and was blaming Amit Shah. Even the electrician thinks I am always on high. How can I do such gaffes on a regular basis? How come it became natural for me to commit mistakes and talk nonsense? Here am I, the son of former Prime Minister, who was the son of a former Prime Minister, who was the daughter of a former Prime Minister. How can the theory of genetics be wrong?”
“Last month, worried about my continuous degradation in the public life, Momma contacted a sorceress from Milan, a beautiful city in Italy. This particular sorceress was considered to be living from the times of Galileo and you know what she said? The opposition party used Black Magic to target me. And, it started even before I entered into politics.”
“Even as BJP formed their first ever government, they schemed to rule India forever. So, they have to stop me because I am the only one who can stop BJP. Worried at my intelligence, oratory and management skills, they feared that they may not rule forever as their ideologues planned. They wanted the country to be corruption free and develop like China. But, we are not inhuman like the Chinese, who execute their corrupt officials. How can we have development that comes at the cost of lives of corrupt officers and politicians? It cannot so happen. I will never allow it to happen.”
“It was then, someone from BJP started using Black Magic to target my mental prowess. Slowly my intelligence started reducing. I became more agitated. I started speaking without thinking of consequences, as I am talking now. Momma asked the sorceress to be our guest and do counter the Black Magic so I can become normal guy again.”
All the audience were listening attentively as if they were watching Ramsay film. They could visualise a girl going under shower only be bathed in red colour water.
Sensing their attention, Rahul declared “Alas, the sorceress could not come to India. She was denied visa by the BJP government. Now, tell me what harm a four hundred year old lady could do to our country. She was coming only to help me, to rehabilitate me. But, the BJP leadership is not taking any chances and are preventing her visit to India. So, I am visiting her to get rid of the ill effects of Black Magic. Whenever I feel not comfortable, I go to the place where she was visiting another client. So I travelled to Thailand, Mauritius and Hawaii. Even these visits were ridiculed by BJP as they called them pleasure visits. How can I, the eternal bachelor be engaged any pleasure seeking activities?”
“Finally I spoke my mind and took a heavy burden off. Now, as I spoke the truth, let BJP deny they have not engaged in witchcraft against me. They will never tell. They can’t see in my eye. They can’t smell my breath. They can’t stand my touch. They shiver when I hug them. And they fear even my winks”.
He suddenly shuddered and opened eyes. Sonia Gandhi was shaking him and said “Stop giving speeches in dreams. Get up and get ready. You need to visit two temples and one mosque today”.",POLITICS,Fake
Trying to snake-charm buffalo,"Bhains Ke Aage Been Bajana proved correct in Dewas when the domestic animal turned violent. Perhaps, this Biblical phrase was a kind of instruction to the people by Jesus Christ. Its meaning was usually taken as a useless effort or negligence that was what the Congress party functionaries along with the anguished commuters wanted to portray at their protest site.
But their discomfiture in not knowing how to properly deal with a buffalo has come as a very poignant scene before them as they could not realise of the animal’s aggressive behaviour all of a sudden. Were they so naive in playing the flute facing the animal with complete concentration?
When the Congress functionaries started trying to snake-charm a buffalo, enraged buffalo hit them hard amid the cacophony. The protestors ran helter-skelter as the buffalo’s fury was similar to Spanish bull in the race. Their planning was just spoiled by the brutal behaviour of the buffalo. They failed to read exactly what the cattle had in its huge mind. The agitators started running for a safe shelter. Some might think in their precocious mind that the buffalo was a staunch follower of the BJP because of its excessive concern about its peer cow. The Congressmen thought their action was for drawing Madhya Pradesh government’s attention towards delay in early approval of an inter-city bus service between Indore and Dewas in MP.
However, their garlanding and playing the flute did not secure ample approval by the particular cattle.
The moment it knocked down the politicians by its pointed horns there was utter chaos and commotion at the protest site. The injuries were treated with the first-aid facility immediately. They soulfully thanked the Almighty that none among them was seriously hurt. What began with a political motive ended in a very sad note.",POLITICS,Fake

Didi’s confusion between ‘Bisibela Bath’ and ‘Blood Bath’,"Setting:
After working hard on pouring down various colours on her old white saree, Didi stood quiet and looked at the violent mix of all ghastly colours. The white piece of cloth looked as if was used to clean a butcher’s shop after used to clean tables in a Mishti house. “How peaceful” she wondered and congratulated herself for painting such a thing that was beyond imagination for any other, ordinary mortal. She walked to the cot that was made of bamboos and jute (to match her simple lifestyle) and rested. She switched on the old Onida Black & White television and Panasonic VCR to watch her favourite recording. A group of her followers clad in simple dhotis were counting the cash that was looted from the Sadhana scam. A blissful smile crossed her lips. The video was a stress buster for her. Within minutes of watching, she relaxes and sleeps sound.
Twist:
After three minutes, however the video got blurred and the B&W TV screen was full of colours. Didi thought there was something wrong with the TV and wanted to tap it on the top so it can become normal. “Don’t get up!” the voice from the TV sprang as the vertical bars of colours transformed into colourful concentric circles zooming in and out simultaneously. “This is even freshening” she said to herself. And, she remembered nothing.
The Interview:
Seeing her immobile condition, Byomkesh Bakshi pulled the curtains and revealed himself. He came straight to her and dangled a gold locket tied to a silver thread in front of her. At the centre of the bangle are two emeralds shaped in the form of leaves, fixed over a crescent. Didi was in a trance but liked it more and decided (in her subconscious) to make it TMC symbol. Her eyes were rolling along with the locket that was swinging like a pendulum. Byomkesh suddenly remembered the Minny Mouse that swung eyes like that at Micky. So, Didi liked the design of locket. He decided to leave the locket for her, after his mission.
In the voice of Amrish Puri (when he was in romantic mood), Byomkesh asked “Didi, Do you want this locket”?
Didi: Yes.
BB: What you will do with it?
Didi: I will make this TMC symbol.
BB: This can be yours, if you clarify few doubts.
Didi: Ask me. Let me warn you. After I answer your questions, if you don’t give me the locket, I will bath in your blood.
Byomkesh genuinely feared. Pulling himself together, he asked the first question.
BB: Why you were threatening the Union government about impending Civil War and Blood Bath.
Didi: Civil War or not. I like to have Blood Bath.
BB: Didi, you were very peaceful lady. How can you think of bathing in blood?
Didi: Who said about bathing in blood? I want to eat ‘Blood Bath’. It is very tasty.
Byomkesh Bakshi was shocked. Eating ‘Blood Bath’? She must have gone nuts, he thought and decided against to continue the interview. ‘You may have the locket’ he handed over the locket to her.
Revealing:
Suddenly there was a sound of slippers flipping on the granite. Someone was coming. Byomkesh hid himself behind the curtain. An old lady came with a tray and set up supper for Didi. Seeing the food in front of her, there was a sparkle in the eyes of Didi. “Yyaah, Blood Bath” she cried loudly and put the locket aside and started eating. The old lady looked at Didi with pity and left. Byomkesh slowly left the room and followed the old lady. She heard his footsteps and turned to face him.
He introduced himself as a secret doctor and asked her what she had given to Didi to eat. She gave him a weird look and said “It was Bisibela Bath”, part of Kannada cuisine. He blurted “But, she was calling it Blood Bath. Why?”
The old lady heaved a sigh and said. “This was happening ever since she returned from Bengaluru after attending swearing ceremony of Kumaraswamy. During the dinner, Bisibela Bath was served and Didi liked it very much. Before she wanted to ask its name, Pappu asked Kumaraswamy what that item was. Already angry with the way he was forced to drink poison, Kumaraswamy said “Blood Bath, a speciality of Karnataka”. And, Didi took it seriously. She liked the taste of Bisibela Bath so much, she was eating it for breakfast, lunch and supper ever since. She had not even touched fish for the last two or three months. She became pure vegetarian. And I too am now forced to eat Bisibela Bath thrice a day”. She looked sad.
“So, you mean, Didi referred to Bisibela bath, when she threatened Central Government about Blood bath?” he probed further.
“The point is her English is a bit poor”, the old lady continued. “In fact she was supporting NRC. All she meant was once uncivilised people fighting on the streets would go away, the fights on the streets would be between only civilised ones – meaning only ‘debates and arguments’ and no physical fights. And, everyone would eat the vegetarian Bisibela Bath and live happily forever”.
A sarcastic smile passed over the lips of the old lady. “Coupled with her poor English were her ferocious facial expressions. And, she communicated something that is entirely opposite of what she wanted to say”.
“OMG!” Byomkesh stunned at the explanation. “OMG, OMG” he repeated further.
The old lady slapped him as if to pull him out of shock. “There is nothing to do with God. One should have control over language and body language as well”. Byomkesh nodded in agreement.
“Would you like to have some Bisibela Bath” she invited him to have supper with her. “Yes, Mam. Sure I would like to taste the item that transformed Didi”

Mamta insists on united fight,"What has been insisted by TMC leader Mamta Bannerji was moving with united stand in view of the BJP’s prevailing political position? This decisive strength can help win the ensuing parliamentary elections. Her January 19, 2019 rally was supposedly planned for the similar political cause.
She has firmly decided to stand on the standard of united we stand for defeating the BJP. Following her meeting with political big-wigs including Sonia Gandhi made her say: “Fight together, leader (Prime Minister) will be chosen later.”
Despite all the hostile criticisms by the Bhartiya Janata Party politicians, she was not frozen with her feet rooted where she firmly stood. She was utterly frank in girding up her loins for giving a befitting reply to the party in power in the approaching elections.
She wanted an invigorated political fight against the RSS-backed political party. However, she at the same time should also consider the disadvantages of the leaderless electoral battle. Will the consequences emerge the same as she visualises?
She pointed at defeating the BJP in different states where opposition stood in a strong position. Their collective fight would contain the BJP’s victory march keeping in mind its only aim of defeating the BJP at all costs.
All we can do was to stand firm on our combined purpose or else be entirely unable to overcome the saffron wave, she pointed out. If the BJP was criticising the TMC, BSP, SP, NCP, AAP and others for their collective approach, it was only to down their morale.
The BJP was taking every helpful constructive step to repeat the 2014 magic on the ground level. If its every step is vast and yet part of a larger design, there looks no obvious point in getting disheartened. The fight between the opposition allies’ persistence and the BJP’s resistance is power-enthused.",POLITICS,Fake
Why not register of politicians?,"When there continues so much hue and cry over the national register of citizenship, there should also be prepared a register of our politicians containing classified details. Instead, this should be an encyclopaedia. It can be decided by the politicians. The generations come to know of their deeds and contributions through that big book. When will this idea get momentum?
India entered into the extradition treaty with Bangladesh to bring back the ULFA separatists. The fate of forty lakh excluded from National Register of the Citizenship hangs in balance. How can they be pushed out to Bangladesh in case their citizenship proved? As regards Dharamshala, our country accepted Aryans, Huns, Portuguese, Arabs, Afghans, Jews, Dutch and English people who settled here. The recent Hungama is merely politics to contest elections in days to come. The ruling party knows very well that this issue of immigrants can bring sufficient benefit in the form of votes. The Congress party disagrees with the BJP on the issue while the Communists are sympathetic with them.
It is not only in our country but even the European countries have furthered the spurt of the Muslim population. Such kind of voice subsides with the passing of the time. The issue is not the exercise under the supervision of the apex court. Those numbers of enormous people who were supposed to have come from Bangladesh told to prove their identity. The humanitarian ground loses its vehemence in view of political perplexity. The matter, as certain politicians rightly said, was directly linked up with the Muslim inhabitants in Assam.
The political benefit could be reaped out of this issue in the state of Assam. That is being done with forceful efforts as leaders of the ruling party spare no time in expressing some words on the intricate issue.",POLITICS,Fake
"'Cow smuggling will be legalised with full tax waiver, once Congress comes to power' - RaGa steals hearts","New Delhi: Congress President and future Prime Minister of India, Rahul Gandhi has won the hearts of the non-communal Indians in a single statement. This has been proclaimed as the biggest assault on the Sangh and BJP by his coterie.
Speaking at a press meet, the winking superhero with the twinkle in his kingly eyes, Rahul Gandhi, spoke at length about politics. ‘Modi might not know the power of our people. Our people had always loved and cherished the term Pappu. Every other boy is a Pappu, but can you show me a boy named Modi? This should be realised by Modi and RSS. They are not targeting a single Pappu, that is me. They are targeting the entire Pappustan.’
‘Another burning issue that worries me for the past four years is the behaviour of gaurakshak. These mobs lynch people. People who had been labelled as cow smugglers and cow thieves.’, the Prince with Golden heart paused to look at us reporters. Two female reporters fainted with an eternal aww in their mouth and they were sent to their NDTV office once their visa was verified.
‘Let me say this clearly. Cow smuggling will be made a legal job once Congress comes to power. We will not call it cow smuggling, we will call it discreet transfer of cow ownership. Sorry, it will be called Rajiv Gandhi Gau Ownership Yojana. Under this, all the new secular cow owners need not pay tax for revenue generated by transporting them across borders. No GST too.’ There was huge round of applause and Congress workers outside the press club started burning crackers and feeding cakes to posters of Rahul.
News channels were splashed with this historic announcement and cow smugglers future secular cow owners rejoiced at this announcement. Communal Cow owners were shocked, but could not express it outside due to fear of being labelled a Hindu.
Not all cow smugglers future cow owners were happy. ‘We were earlier scared of being lynched by the communal cow owners and protectors. That fear still resides in us. We will request our next PM to provide us legal protection when we carry on with our job, which could involve terminating the cow owners along with the ownership.’
A senior lawyer-cum-activist cleared their fears saying that ‘the secular future cow owners have those rights even now and they have the backing of liberals and seculars with them if they terminate the communal cow owners if they do not comply during the transfer of ownership’.",POLITICS,Fake
Trinomoola Congress MP Derek No'Brain crowned as 'best Social Media influencer' by Forbes,"New Delhi: Everybody knows Trinomoola Congress MP Derek No’Brain. To identify him as is a no-brainer. He is the news now after appearing in Forbes’ best Social Media influencer.
While the Nazi Trinomoola party is busy butchering its opposition party cadres, like (what about Akhlaq, what about Wani) BJP, Mr. No’Brain is busy influencing their Twitter accounts online. And this has changed his path from quizmaster to a social media broker influencer.
In the Forbes’ list, Derek was at the top of the people who easily made it to influencer club. It all started when No’Brain mentioned a private citizen Rahul Taj in the Parliament. Since then, the name Rahul was recorded in the logs of the Parliament. ‘A momentary break from hysterical laughter for its readers who read through the debates of other Rahul’s in the Parliament’, an analyst commented.
Recently, No’Brain has also dragged another private citizen Prash Patel. ‘After No’Brain spelt my name in the Parliament, my Twitter account got 1 lakh followers’, claimed Mr. Patel. ‘Dude, I got some 4 lakh added. Without spending a single paisa‘, brimmed Rahul (the private citizen).
After the Patel’s incident, several other Twitter users were seen begging, pleading, trolling, spamming and even abusing No’Brain in Twitter so that their account too gets a lot of followers.
Social Media’s (ex-)biggest influencer company, WeFollow’s CEO, Anand Varma, was continuously mentioning No’Brain from the Twitter accounts bought by his clients to his company. ‘Somehow, we should get his attention. A single utterance of our client’s name in the Parliament will surpass our previous profits’, Anand sounded excited.
However, Twitter users from Bangla (aka West Bengal) were scared of mentioning No’Brain on Twitter. ‘We too will get followers when we try to mention him’, commented a student from Kolkotta, ‘we will get hundreds of followers, not in Twitter, but on our roads, following to finish me off.’",POLITICS,Fake

A city based cosmetic surgeon even offered to surgically remove one of Hiren’s buttock free of charge. “Why wait for the next birth. I will help this man in this life itself,” said the doctor.
After this news went viral on social media, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal assured that he’d set up a special committee to study and find out a solution to this problem. The committee will be headed by a retired IIT professor and a report is expected to to tabled in a year.

Woman who shifted from Delhi to Mumbai gains 5kgs in 5 days after not having to run due to eve teasing,"Mumbai: As compared to Mumbai and Kolkata where citizens sharply react to any incident of molestation or eve-teasing, such reactions are totally lacking or missing on the part of citizens of Delhi who have a vital role to play in preventing harassment to the women traveling in the city. A live example has come to our notice yesterday.
A woman, who had shifted from Delhi to Mumbai a few days back due to work commitments found out that she had gained 5 kgs in 5 days without even changing any dietary habits or any weather conditions.
Priyanka Ranaut, who works for an MNC shifted to Mumbai 5 days back. And in those 5 days, she never ran away due to any eve teaser harassing her, which was quite common in Delhi. But that scenario had created havoc in her personal life. Gaining 5 kgs in 5 days, she doesn’t where will it all stop.
If the same situation continues, she might gain a lot of weight which will be fatal to health. Many Gyms across the city have sent her their brochure of losing weight in a 30-day challenge or cashback offers.
The Maharashtra government is using this news to boast about the good law and order situation in Mumbai and has promised that to deal with issues which priyanka had to face, the government will subsidize Gym expenditures every month for women.",POLITICS,Fake
'Just trying to fit into Delhi culture by brandishing gun' says ex-BSP MP's son over accusation,"Putting across his side of the story, ex- BSP MPs son Ashish Pandey admitted that he did brandish a gun as seen in the video but it was done to fit into the typical Delhi culture.
While elaborating on the ‘typical Delhi culture’, he said, “It’s a Delhi thing you know. When ‘tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai’ doesn’t work then you whip out your gun. It’s done as a scare tactic and no to actually shoot someone.”
“I am from Lucknow and even fights over there done with tehzeeb. I would be treated like an outcast if I tried that in Delhi. So I had to carry a gun and a baseball bat in my car to just to show that I am part of Delhi’s high society,” he added.
South Delhi businessman SK Khurana, though hesitant initially, did agree that these things are common in Delhi and media shouldn’t overreact. “Why is that Arnab behaving like a rabid mongrel over this issue. If he hadn’t brandished the weapon then it would have been a national crisis,” he said.
“I remember once I had an argument with a man after he cut me in traffic. We were talking like gentlemen and sorting the issue when some bystanders got restless and asked when are we going to start fighting. They were not happy with our politeness and wanted to hear some cuss words,” he recollected.
A senior bureaucrat, while commenting in the incident said that people coming from outside should respect the culture of Delhi. “Please liberally flaunt your political connections. Invest in a gun if you can afford it, especially the high society types. Carry a baseball bat in you car to start a road rage without provocation. In fact car dealers should give baseball bats as standard accessory,” he suggested.",POLITICS,Fake

Filmmakers hold protest against actress who blamed Filmmaker Sajid Khan for sexual harassment ask the actress to not call Sajid Khan a ‘Filmmaker’ ,"Mumbai: The #MeToo movement has been gaining momentum across the country with more and more women coming out to tell their ordeal. And with every passing day, allegations against big Bollywood names are surfacing. Director Sajid Khan is the latest to join a long list of Indian celebrities who have been accused of sexual harassment.
As many as three women—an assistant director, an actress, and a journalist—have come forth accusing him of sexually harassing them. But filmmakers are really angry with the actresses.
The reason is weird and correct at the same time. The filmmakers say that calling Sajid a filmmaker is an insult to the whole community. ‘Housefull’, Himmatwala and Humshakkals should not be called as films and the maker of such films should not be called as a filmmaker is what the protesters demanded.
Even some police officers who are handling the Sajid Khan case and who have watched his films have asked the actresses to not use the word ‘filmmaker’ in their FIRs.
On Friday morning, actor Akshay Kumar announced his decision to cancel the shoot of Sajid’s directorial Housefull 4 until “further investigation”. Sajid himself stepped down as director of Housefull 4, and urged “friends in the media to kindly not pass judgment till the truth is out”",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake
Bollywood facing a shortage of scriptwriters as most are busy writing encounter stories for UP police,"Lucknow: The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government has very proudly announced success in “controlling crime” by instilling the ‘fear of God’ through a spree of police encounters. The Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have carried out as many as 1,478 encounters over a span of 14 months, leaving 62 outlaws dead and 390 wounded.
But Bollywood is facing the wrath of increasing number of encounters in UP. Actually, an encounter needs a dramatic story to be told to the media to make them realize the impact as well as the importance of the encounter.
And that’s the reason there is a great demand for scriptwriters in Lucknow right now and the pay is lucrative too. Many writers have already shifted base and many are in the process of doing so.
The UP police is checking previous records and work profile of the writers so that the stories don’t come out to be a comedy or a boring one. Dramatic writers and writers who have written hardcore blockbusters have been preferred as we write.
Writers of Ekta Kapoor serials have been given extra lucrative to come to UP and write encounter stories as their ability to create drama in the long lasting serials is of no doubt. Many TV anchors who also create a lot of drama have been offered jobs with the UP police.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

You can all of my last 5-6 films, never has the female character been given substantial role and there is a reason behind this. I have been supporting the #MeToo campaign much before it actually became a big campaign.”
Salman also added that Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan support the cause, even more, and that is the reason they work in fewer films so that they don’t get attracted to a woman on sets and harass her sexually. Well, we should also be proud of actors like Fardeen Khan, Tusshar Kapoor and Uday Chopra for staying in homes and not going to work on film sets where the dignity of a woman is always put to test.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

"Salman to shoot Race 4, 5 and 6 in one go to make most of Govt’s fuel price cut","In an effort to make most of Maharashtra Govt’s fuel price cut, Bollywood actor Salman Khan announced that he’d be shooting the next three installment of his Race franchise in one go.
The price cut has brought relief to the makers of the movie who had almost shelved Race 4 owing to petrol prices touching 90 in Mumbai.
“You never know when the prices may rise again. Our movie involves a lot of cars and racing and very little acting. Most of our budget is spent on fuel. So this move by Govt has reduced the cost by 50%,” said Producer of the movie.
When questioned as to how they plan to complete the movie production before the prices rise again, he said, “Scripting usually takes the maximum time while making a movie. But since this is a Salman movie, there are no scripts. He will just show up at the movie studio and do some random scenes. Will throw in a few dance steps by Katrina and few race scenes. That’s it! The movie is done.”
Apparently, Salman too is very eager to commence the shoot after Race 3 ‘success’. “There are many Bollywood star kids who are currently out of work. They all want Race franchise to do for them what Race 3 did for Bobby Deol,” said a source.
Meanhwhile, Spokesperson for the ruling party Mr. Sambit Patra went all out praising the achievements of his Govt. He said that by cutting fuel prices PM has also given rozgaar to star kids.

Telecom company replies to Pritam's complaint of not getting a dialer tone saying they are afraid he might copy it,"Mumbai: In a shocking incident which happened in Mumbai, a telecom company has pruned the dialer tone from the mobile phone of music director Pritam. Every mobile phone handset gets dialer tone when someone dials a number. But for Pritam, the service was pruned last week when the company realized that he may copy it and make a song out of it. 
The whole incident came to light on Thursday when Pritam got a reply email from the telecom company. Actually, one week back when Pritam realized that whenever he dials a number he was not able to listen to any dialer tone, he registered a complaint at the IIN network. IIN network engineers did s thorough investigation and found out that dialer tone services are stopped for Anu Malik, Pritam, and some other music directors. This was after some strict orders from the top brass who felt that the dialer tone if made into a hit song by Pritam, will become so viral that people will think that Pritam has made it and will give all credit to Pritam.
The IIN network is now making a list of people who copy tweets, music, projects and other important things to make sure that such people don’t get caller tunes, dialer tones and other such type of services which they can then use for their benefits.
Pritam spoke to Faking News and he had this to say, ” I am not saying that I don’t copy tunes, but why should I copy a dialer tone. Do you think the tune of Dialer tone can be made into a Bollywood song? It’s impossible. In fact. I had tried it once but it didn’t happen. I have assured the telecom company that I won’t copy the dialer tone.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

Progress on Dhoni’s biopic slows down as Sushant finds it hard to play with low strike rate as current Dhoni,"New Delhi: We have good news for all the Sushant Singh Rajput fans out there. The sequel to the 2016 hit film M S Dhoni: The Untold Story is on the cards and Sushant Singh Rajput will reprise his role in the film. The second installment will focus on Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s life after the 2011 world cup victory and it will also document different facets of his personal life. It has been observed by many fans that Dhoni after the 2011 World Cup has been too slow in scoring and has been playing defensive cricket. His die-hard fans believe that Dhoni has matured over the years and so he takes time in building his innings. Sushant Singh has started practicing defensive shots. Defending full tosses is a difficult art and it requires great dedication.
Sushant wants to play it real, the way Dhoni does it with calm and ease.
Post-2011, MSD has been taking up the role of sheet anchor and has taken the unnecessary burden on his shoulders. Sushant wants to bring this aspect to the new biopic. The new biopic will also focus on the careers of Parthiv Patel, Saha, Dinesh Karthik and Rishab Pant, which were destroyed by Dhoni’s presence in the team. The biopic will also show how Pune owners were against Dhoni’s slow captaincy and had to replace him with Steve Smith and also the CSK triumph in 2018 after a gap of 2 years in IPL.
Sushant is also hearing a lot of Stump mic recordings as post-2011 Dhoni has been heard a lot behind the stumps and less in press conferences. For the next 30 days, Sushant will only practice defending full tosses and will focus on other aspects afterward.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake
"After Taimur fails to comment on the Tanushree-Nana molestation case, reporter writes 'Bollywood quiet on sexual harassment'","Mumbai: Actress Tanushree Dutta hasn’t received any legal notice from Nana Patekar, she told news agency yet again on Tuesday. Tanushree has also accused Nana Patekar of sending goons to intimidate her after she walked out of a special song sequence because of his alleged inappropriate behavior. But reporters are angry with Bollywood not being vocal enough for sexual harassment cases.
Yesterday, a reporter named Shwetank Malik wrote a piece on how Bollywood has stayed quiet on all major issues. His evidence was the fact that Taimur has still not commented on the Tanushree-Nana saga yet. He had personally visited Taimur to ask about his views on the whole sexual harassment problem which has been a black mark on Bollywood for long. But Taimur was quiet for the whole interview, in fact, he didn’t pay any attention to the question and was busy playing with his toy.
Shwetank has a valid point. If star kids like Taimur don’t speak up now, they will also become an integral part of the dirty system that is Bollywood. There is no one to trust now. Shwetank even tried asking the same question to Tushaar Kapoor’s 2-year-old kid and Farah Khan’s three kids but no one came in support of Tanushree.

"Not Able To Kiss Dad, SOTY Remake And A Lot More On This Week’s Fake Friendly Fridays With Taimur","Fake Friendly Fridays is a section where we pick a famous personality and throw fake questions at him/her and in return, we receive fake answers. Why should you not take it seriously? Because it is fake.
If you still didn’t get it: This is a fake interview written purely on the basis of the author’s imagination of how the actual interview would have been if we got the chance to interview these famous (for all the wrong reasons) personalities in real. In short, just have a good laugh!
We’ve been trying to approach the chhota nawaab, Taimur Ali Khan for a (FAKE) interview for quite some time now. After months of invitations, requests and a lot more, we finally have him here with us.
And so, without further ado, please welcome Bollywood’s favorite kid (sorry, Ranbir), none other than Taimur Ali Khan (or I’ll stick with just Taimur, because come on, it’s not fair on this kid).
*audience goes uh-la-la as the curtains open and the cute, little kid Taimur is seen sitting comfortably on the sofa*
ED: Thank you for joining us, Taimur! You’re blessed to have perhaps the best set of genes possible on the planet, and so are we, to have you here.
Taimur: *yawns*
*some journalists in the audience are heard cheering as they seem to have got some new story material*
ED: Um, okay. That was a nice gesture. Talking about gestures, we’ve heard that you and your mother are sad these days because you guys can’t kiss Papa Saif’s cheeks anymore because of his beard. What do you have to say?
Taimur: *stretches his arms and offers a smile*
*audience goes crazy to catch a glimpse of Taimur’s smile while Taimur looks at them in amusement*
ED: Well, you don’t seem to be too concerned about it. There’s something that concerns me, though. While the average package that my University offers is 6 lakhs per annum at best, we’ve heard that your nanny earns more than 18 lakhs per annum, excluding bonuses. What sort of services does she offer?
Taimur: PaPaPaPa…. *indistinct mumbles*
*audience cheers to have heard something from Taimur’s mouth while the journalists in the house are heard typing their latest Taimur story*
ED: That wasn’t so clear, Taimur. But yes, we know that your Papa is rich. Wish I can assist your nanny with something and get paid for it, hehehe.
Anyway, we’ve heard that you will star in the remake of Student Of The Year alongside Abram Khan and Aaradhya Bachchan, directed by Karan Johar’s son, Yash Johar. We can’t wait for it!
*audience goes wild at the prospect of this SOTY remake*
Taimur: *gives a clueless expression as he can’t seem to understand what’s going on*
ED: Don’t worry, Taimur. We don’t know what we are doing here either. By the way, your wardrobe is a better topic of discussion than your father’s career. What do you have to say?
*sounds of ‘uhhhhhh’ from the audience*
Taimur: *starts crying*
*sounds of ‘awwww’ from the audience*
ED: Oops! That’s not what we wanted, Taimur. We’re so sorry, we didn’t mean to make you cry.
*Taimur’s 18-LPA-earning nanny appears on the stage, picks him up from the sofa and disappears*
ED: What? Why? Um, okay. I think that’s it from our side. Thank you for joining us for this (FAKE) interview. We hope you enjoyed this.

Karan Johar disguised as female nurse to launch Shahid Kapoor’s second child,"Wednesday evening came as a blessing for Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput as they were blessed with a baby boy. Mira had been admitted to Mumbai’s Hinduja hospital where she gave birth to her second child.
There were many shocks and surprises which came along. As per reports, lead nurse started humming ‘Kuch Kuch hota hai’ tone seconds before the birth of baby.

I did it singlehandedly as always. ’ screamed cheerful Johar when confronted by media.
Between, bollywood fraternity poured their wishes on Kapoor family for this wonderful day.

What if PC declares finally,"When ould Priyanka spoil her film career for marriage? Marriage for the Desi girl is as important as continuing her film career. Her preference for the Hollywood film Cowboy Ninja Viking opposite Chris Pratt might have forced her to walk out of Salman Khan’s Bharat. Would she fancy spoiling her fabulous film career for marriage?
Famous as Desi girl she has nearly chosen Nick as a life partner though she was desperately concealing the ring in her jeans pocket. Whatever should be told about her wedding plan, she was supposed to announce something in the ongoing month. A very popular pair has announced nuptial day. What goes wrong if Pee Cee also takes the initiative in the same way. Indications were directing towards marriage plans but a concrete decision is yet to come.
Nick Jonas indicated positively by expressing his thanks to those wishing him happy engagement. He looked a little bit more open and expressive in hinting at the final wedding plan of his life. The rest will come from Priyanka in ensuing days. Why she has selected an American groom can be a hot topic. If Priyanka is 36, Nick is 26 at present. If she is a pure Indian, he is strictly American.
The American singer Nick desires Priyanka Chopra because her encounter made a decisive impression upon him. He was keenly or impulsively inclined in favour of whatever the ladylove wishes. He was pulling out all the stops when it comes to currying favour with the dearly loved. For her, an American partner is suiting most.
Besides Bollywood and Hollywood, even Duchess Meghan Markel was reportedly dying to be a bridesmaid at their nuptials. However, Priyanka appeared to be the mediator like Valentine and Nick remained a mediated subject matter like Proteus of Shakespeare’s ‘The Two Gentlemen of Verona.’",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake
How Crime Patrol helped an innocent child get back his first love,"Bunty was busy doing his never-ending homework when the idea hit him. It was so convincing that he couldn’t hold back his tears. All the pieces of evidence were pointing in one direction and one direction only- that his parents were guilty. He couldn’t believe it, but the series of events flashed before his eyes. It can’t be a mere coincidence. It was all planned from Day 1. Suddenly, a fear gripped him. Is he safe in this house or his parents are plotting against him in their room?
Perhaps, that’s why they don’t allow him to sleep with them anymore so that they can plot against him at night. He knew that getting the truth out of them is not going to be easy, but he knew what needs to be done. After all, he has been watching Crime Patrol since his infant days and now that he was in UKG, his database included 330 cases of different crimes and evidence gathering techniques.
Without wasting any time, he started to gather evidence. To begin with he tried to listen to his parents’ talks after they went to their bedroom. The voice was fumbled, and the evidence was non-conclusive. He knew that time is of the essence and he needs to think something fast. He tried to contact his local informer, his granny, but to no avail. Granny was also caught unaware of the whole plan. Then he decided to take the inquiry head-on and apply third-degree torture to his parents to get the truth out of them. He mustered all the courage he had and told his parents that he won’t have dinner until his parents told him the truth. This turned out to be his checkmate move and his parents got caught in a tough spot. Finally, they were willing to cooperate.
That’s when Bunty asked them the question which has been bothering him day in and day out. The question due to which he was not able to focus on his first love and next-door neighbor Babli for past 2 weeks. “Is Bunty’s tuition teacher giving him so much homework based on their instructions (or their ‘Plan’ as Bunty liked to think of it)”. Initially, his parents denied, but Bunty knew he had to increase the intensity of the torture for them to relent. So, he said that he will have to skip the breakfast tomorrow as well, to get the truth. Exactly at this point in time, his mom burst into tears and accepted her crime. Bunty’s daily mobile gaming habits to impress Babli was getting onto her and finally, she took this hideous path which turned out to be a point of no return. She told him how she requested his tuition teacher to give him extra homework so that he can be occupied and focus on studies rather than playing with Babli whole day.
Bunty knew he had solved the case, and he only had Crime Patrol and Anoop Soni to thank for it.  When Faking News correspondent reached out to Bunty to congratulate him on solving this case, he was very happy to get back his lost love. Babli told our correspondent “Jab dil me ho Bunty, to kya bigaad legi Aunty”. And Bunty’s pearls of wisdom were: “Savdhan rahein, Satark rahein aur dekhte rahein Crime Patrol”.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

"‘Saas Bahu’ serials making viewers retarded, doctors perplexed","Mumbai: In a study which has perplexed neurologists and radiologists across the world, it has been found that Indian ‘Saas Bahu’ TV serial viewers suffered from early cerebral atrophy than those who did not watch, and that they are hazardous to the human brain.
In a double blinded randomized control study on the idiotic and irritating Indian TV serial viewers over 10 years, it has been found that the serials have added 0 % intellectual growth in its viewers, with shows defying all logic and have made many sane viewers go retard over time. With serials which seem to have no end but are more like ‘Draupadi ka cheer’ instead, the study concluded that India is fast slipping into becoming the greatest nation in the world when it comes to dumbness.
From Sasural Simar Ka to Saath Nibhana Saathiya to Balika Vadhu, the rotten Indian TV soap industry has now made a reputation of pretty much having the same core theme – a good for nothing husband and a powerful/cruel mother and their innocent Daughter in law; daughter in law facing all kinds of cruel treatments from the family; unbelievable number of kidnappings / injuries /divorces, etc; and the family’s favorite time pass being organization of functions every next episode with dance performances without any reason. Unconfirmed reports have claimed that even the actors of these serials laugh after watching the brainless sequences.
The Indian Neurology Society has called for a ban on these serials with legal proceedings against their directors for fooling and making people dumb. The ruling BJP government has meanwhile supported the study and claimed that Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s low IQ was also due to these serials, with mother Sonia Gandhi rubbishing the claim and stating that ‘he’ was just an untimely accident.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

The reason for this unique request was to enable him to sit as the fourth passenger on a local train seat meant for three.
Speaking to Faking News Hiren said, “I have been travelling by train since last ten years. And all the seats are already taken when I enter the compartment. Leaving me with that uncomfortable fourth seat, where one of my buttock in left hanging without support. By the end of the day I am left with one sore butt. So my only prayer to the almighty is to give me just one buttock.”
Hiren’s request struck a chord with many other passengers who have been braving heavy rush in local trains for all these years. A city based cosmetic surgeon even offered to surgically remove one of Hiren’s buttock free of charge. “Why wait for the next birth. I will help this man in this life itself,” said the doctor.
After this news went viral on social media, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal assured that he’d set up a special committee to study and find out a solution to this problem. The committee will be headed by a retired IIT professor and a report is expected to to tabled in a year.

Woman who shifted from Delhi to Mumbai gains 5kgs in 5 days after not having to run due to eve teasing,"Mumbai: As compared to Mumbai and Kolkata where citizens sharply react to any incident of molestation or eve-teasing, such reactions are totally lacking or missing on the part of citizens of Delhi who have a vital role to play in preventing harassment to the women traveling in the city.

If the same situation continues, she might gain a lot of weight which will be fatal to health. Many Gyms across the city have sent her their brochure of losing weight in a 30-day challenge or cashback offers.
The Maharashtra government is using this news to boast about the good law and order situation in Mumbai and has promised that to deal with issues which priyanka had to face, the government will subsidize Gym expenditures every month for women.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

While elaborating on the ‘typical Delhi culture’, he said, “It’s a Delhi thing you know. When ‘tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai’ doesn’t work then you whip out your gun. It’s done as a scare tactic and no to actually shoot someone.”
“I am from Lucknow and even fights over there done with tehzeeb. I would be treated like an outcast if I tried that in Delhi. So I had to carry a gun and a baseball bat in my car to just to show that I am part of Delhi’s high society,” he added.
South Delhi businessman SK Khurana, though hesitant initially, did agree that these things are common in Delhi and media shouldn’t overreact. “Why is that Arnab behaving like a rabid mongrel over this issue. If he hadn’t brandished the weapon then it would have been a national crisis,” he said.
“I remember once I had an argument with a man after he cut me in traffic. We were talking like gentlemen and sorting the issue when some bystanders got restless and asked when are we going to start fighting. They were not happy with our politeness and wanted to hear some cuss words,” he recollected.
A senior bureaucrat, while commenting in the incident said that people coming from outside should respect the culture of Delhi. “Please liberally flaunt your political connections. Invest in a gun if you can afford it, especially the high society types. Carry a baseball bat in you car to start a road rage without provocation. In fact car dealers should give baseball bats as standard accessory,” he suggested.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake
College withholds Mechanical engineer's degree for being in relationship with a girl,"Mumbai: 10 reasons to fall in love with mechanical engineers – do you know why smart girls prefer dating a mechanical engineer? Mechanical engineers are some of the best people to date with. A good sense of logic, better salary, better communication, extra technical knowledge about almost everything makes a mechanical engineer a perfect guy to date. Enough of these jokes now. Lets come straight to the news. A college in Mumbai actually witholded aMechanical Engineer’s degree as he was dating a girl which is against the traditions of the Mechanical batch.
The news started with Sanil Malik a 4th-year student of Enimity Engineering college. He was dating a girl for the last 2 years, all these in hideouts as he was too embarrassed to tell this to his fellow batchmates. Mechanical Engineers are the Bhisma Pitamah of the current generation, where even talking to a girl is against traditions, parampara as they call it. His act was caught just 2 days before his convocation and he had to speak the truth then as his roaming with the girl was caught on CCTV cameras too. The college had never allowed any student from the mechanical batch to fall in love with a girl.
And Sanil was the latest victim of the tradition-face-off. Sanil has been told to spend one full year in the college living a single life without any relationship as part of the punishment.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake
Messi's email account flooded with health check packages from Indian Diabetes doctors after Maradona's '20 times loo' comment,"Mumbai: If you notice you’re peeing a lot — meaning that you’re urinating more often than what’s normal for you — it’s possible your frequent urination could be an early sign of diabetes. However, there are many potential causes of frequent urination, including some that are harmless. We got this information from a healthcare website. Argentina legend Diego Maradona’s categorization of Lionel Messi as ‘not a leader’ left plenty of fans, family members and international teammates bemused. 
Maradona had said: “Messi’s a great player, but he’s not a leader. Before talking to the coach and players, he’ll play on the PlayStation. Then, on the pitch, he wants to be the leader. He’s the best along with Cristiano Ronaldo but for me, it’s pointless to make a leader out of a man who goes to the bathroom 20 times before a match.” And Messi had to pay the price for Maradona’s comments. Today morning when he got up, he was surprised to see his phone hang due to 1000s of emails from Indian Diabetes doctors. Everyone had the same reply, ‘FREQUENT URINATION IS A SIGN OF DIABETES’. Messi received health check packages from all leading dostors of India and he was left confused as to what to do with such messages.
Some doctors had in fact personally visited him this morning as they see a business opportunity in Messi’s disease. The doctors have promised a commission to Maradona which may go upto many millions of dollars. To have a patient like Messi is a dream for many doctors and Indian doctors have surely got a big opportunity to cash in on.",SPORTS,Fake
Water served by Karun Nair was too hot: Selectors explain decision to drop Karun Nair,"Mumbai: Indian squad for the upcoming Test series against West Indies has been announced and the one surprising thing was the omission of Karun Nair. Nair, who was part of the squad for the entire England tour without getting a game, was dropped from the 15 members squad announced yesterday.
Speaking to the journalists, Chief Selector MSK Prasad said,” We decided to drop some players after the England tour due to their poor performances there. Dhawan and Vijay were dropped because they failed to provide consistent starts at the top and Karun Nair was dropped for failing to do his duty of carrying water bottles effectively.”
When asked how did Nair fail in carrying water, he said,” The water must reach the players at the right temperature to satiate their thirst and to energise them. We saw that the water was too hot by the time it reached the players from the fridge in the dressing room. That means Nair was moving too slowly while carrying the drinks out so we had to drop him on fitness grounds.”
Asked if there is a way back for Nair in the team, Mr. Prasad said,” Obviously, the door is always open. He has to learn to move fast while carrying water bottles and hopefully he practices that after this wakeup call. Once he is ready, we will conduct an H2O test, similar to the Yo-Yo test but for players on the bench. If he manages to pass that, he can always be included to carry drinks during the Australian tour.”
Meanwhile, new inclusion Mayank Agarwal was seen running around a stadium with 6 water bottles in his hand as he prepares for the series against West Indies.",SPORTS,Fake
"If Kohli is free, can you ask him to play for us: Imran Khan calls Narendra Modi","Islamabad: Days after calling Indian PM Narendra Modi a small man, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has done a U-turn and called up his Indian counterpart for help. Concerned with the poor form of his Cricket team in Asia Cup, former captain Imran has asked Virat Kohli on loan for the rest of the tournament.
After defeating Hong Kong convincingly, Pakistan has lost twice to India by huge margins and barely scrapped through against Afghanistan in the other fixture. Now they face a knockout game against Bangladesh and Imran wants to win that match at any cost.
Virat Kohli, the Indian captain and currently the highest rated batsman in the world, is not part of the Indian team for Asia Cup and is resting in India.
Speaking to Faking News, a Pakistan government official said, “This can be the start of a beautiful India-Pakistan friendship if Modi and Kohli agree. Kohli is just doing some advertisements at the moment so he is practically free and we need a batsman so why not?”
When asked why Kohli, he said, “Looks like you haven’t seen our batting in this tournament. Otherwise you wouldn’t have asked this question. However, it is not just his batting that we require, we need at least one player in the team who can take a catch. We don’t want to see the Nagin dance from Bangladesh, nobody in the world wants to see the nagin dance from Bangladesh so for the love of humanity, approve this loan and send Kohli to Dubai.”
Indian PM Office refused to confirm whether the wish will be granted or not. A senior official said,” Initially we thought Imran is calling to ask for funds for his dam project and when he said he needs a person from India, we thought maybe he is getting married again and this time to an Indian but we were wrong. He asked for Kohli for a week and PM Modi is yet to discuss it with Virat. We will communicate our response accordingly after that.”

Shikhar Dhawan suffers groin injury after excessively slapping his thigh to celebrate victory over Pak,"Flamboyant Indian batsman Shikhar Dhawan suffered groin injury while celebrating the victory in his trademark ‘thigh slapping’ style.
After scoring a century and beating arch rivals Pakistan, Dhawan was ecstatic and unstoppable with his celebration.
But it seems his thighs were not ready for what was in store for them.
While speaking to the media, team spokesperson said, “Unki janghon me soojan aa gayi hai. Doctors are waiting for the x-ray report. We are hoping that the injury is not as bad as it looks.”
The the cricketer spent the entire day lying on the chair with an ice pack wrapped around his groin and may miss the net practice.
Sources say that the in-form batsman could be ruled out of the next match if the swelling doesn’t get better.
Faking News spoke to team mate Yuzvendra Chahal on what transpired in the dressing room post victory and he said that the team got carried away with celebrations in the dressing room. “Shikhar opened his thighs for other players to slap too. We all were just too happy to have beaten Pak twice. Didn’t realize this would happen,” he said.
Coach Ravi Shastri reprimanded the players and said that the team was behaving like high school kids.
In a strongly worded message he warned the players from taking part in any celebrations and focus on the upcoming matches till the Asia cup is over.",SPORTS,Fake
"Media hails Taimur after India's win, says Kedar Jadhav's release point is equal to Taimur's height","Mumbai: Rohit was really happy with the way his bowlers performed, especially Jadhav, who got three important wickets. “Kedar has been working on his bowling, and he takes his bowling seriously. It augurs well for the team, and the wickets are a bonus for us. His overs in middle are very crucial, especially after Hardik’s injury,” Rohit said. Kedar Jadhav’s unconventional release point during delivery stride has made many batsmen go searching for the ball and in the process give away their wicket.
Jadhav has three variations in his bowling, namely, low, lower and lowest. It is very difficult to play against his balls as he never gets any bounce from the pitch. Pakistani team is finding short heightened batsmen in the country to quickly send them to Dubai to tackle Kedar’s bowling. Such is the impact that Kedar has made. Coaches around the world are asking for new bowling machines which can deliver balls from a very low trajectory to make their batsmen simulate the conditions of facing Kedar Jadhav in the matches. TV channels have started placing low trajectory cameras to capture the bowling of Kedar as the normal camera doesn’t show the ball reaching the batsmen as it is too low.
“I certainly haven’t been bowling it all along. But I like creativity so when I was bowling, I realized off-spinners are usual. Anyone who does not know to bowl will bowl off-spin. That’s when I tried a few new things like the sidearm ball and it worked. I tried it in the match and it got me wickets so stuck with it,” Kedar had told a few months back to a news source.",SPORTS,Fake
Startup develops gadget that mutes TV whenever Ramiz Raja speaks,"Bengaluru: A Bengaluru based startup has developed a revolutionary gadget that is set to change Cricket watching experience in India. Once connected to the TV, the gadget will automatically mute the sound whenever Ramiz Raja speaks during commentary.
After testing the device during the first India-Pakistan match in the Asia Cup, they are ready for a nationwide release ahead of the next India-Pakistan match in Super 4 stage.
Speaking to the media at the product launch, the company’s chief engineer said, “Technology should always be used to solve the problems faced by the people and Ramiz Raja’s commentary was a problem faced by all the cricket fans. Thousands of people reported bleeding from their ears whenever Ramiz spoke and we just couldn’t let that continue so we came up with this device.”
“Our special feature will ensure that people can still continue to hear the crowd noise and only Ramiz voice is filtered out. Broadcasters are refusing to drop him from the commentary panel, maybe because he took all his salary in advance but we can at least protect the viewers from the assault of his brainless commentary,” he further added.
The company is also working on developing similar device for Sanjay Manjrekar, Danny Morrison and L. Sivaramakrishnan and hopes to launch those products in time for the IPL 2019.",SPORTS,Fake
Virat Kohli told to stay within 10 Kms of Airport by BCCI till the Asia Cup concludes,"Delhi: Indian cricket team skipper Rohit Sharma offered up no excuses for India’s lackluster showing against Hong Kong in their opening game of the Asia Cup 2018 but believes that his side will learn from their mistakes. The amount of time it took India to see off Hong Kong will undoubtedly raise questions over why India chose to put out a much-changed starting XI but Rohit defended the changes, stating they were necessitated by the schedule, with India set to face Pakistan on Wednesday. What India also needs is for Kohli to be able to join the team as and when required.
BCCI has asked Virat to stay within 10 km of Airport so that he can be flown to Dubai if the team requires him. Without Virat, Indian team doesn’t look as threatening as they look with him. Just the mere presence of Kohli near the airport would instill fear in the minds of Opponents. Virat is currently having some off time with family after getting rest from a busy schedule and the long England tour.
Kohli has been asked to pack his kit bag and keep at the airport. BCCI will ask him to fly to Dubai as and when they think that the Indian team is in an extremely hapless situation during the Asia Cup.
Meanwhile, Dhawan said India will go with a “positive and strong” mindset against their arch-rivals. “The ideal situation will be to have a break and then play. We all are humans, so we also get tired as well. But at the same time, we are quite strong enough. Once we go and come tomorrow, of course, it’s a big game, and we all are going to be positive and strong.”",SPORTS,Fake
Who will do Bhangra in case we win a series: Shastri defends Dhawan’s place in side,"London: Indian Coach and cheerleader Ravi Shastri has hit out at critics questioning opener Shikhar Dhawan’s place in the Indian side. Dhawan had an average series in England averaging just above 20 failing to cross 50 in any of his innings. However, it looks like the Indian management is still firmly behind the Bhangra dancer batsman.
Speaking to the media at the end of the series which India lost 1-4, Shastri said,” It is the job of the media to focus on the negatives because you all are negative people. However, I am a very positive person and I will focus only on the positives. You can look at his string of low scores while playing away from India but I can appreciate his superb Bhangra skills which cheer up the entire squad.”
“As a coach, my job is to see what each player brings to the squad and then provide him the right environment to enhance that. Shikhar brings Bhangra and it is my job to make sure he can improve his dance and perform it as well as he can. At the end of the day, performance matters and his performance in his field of expertise has been exceptional”, Shastri added.
Further, he went on to say,” You all want us to drop Shikhar but tell me one thing, if by mistake we win in Australia, then who will dance during the victory celebrations? As part of the team management, it is my job to make sure we have players for every situation and Dhawan is the player for these celebrations, if and when they come.”
When asked if this means Dhawan’s place is secure for the Australian tour, Shastri said,” Oh no, not at all, we encourage competition for places and if some youngster comes up with better moves, we can always look to promote him.”

BCCI arranges Cook's meeting with Amit Shah to convince him to become India's opening batsman,"Mumbai: Alastair Cook said his retirement from international cricket has been an “18-month process” after he ended his Test batting career with a century against India in the fifth Test at The Oval. Cook’s loss will be huge for England given their average opening batsmen. But his retirement can be a blessing in disguise for India as there are chances that he can become India’s opening batsman. BCCI is said to be arranging a secret meeting between Cook and Amit Shah to convince the former that he should play for India as age is on his side.
Cook, who is 33 still has a lot of cricket left in him. Normally an Indian batsman retires at an age of 37-38 after trying to break all records. Amit Shah is known in the political circles as a person who brings people from other parties into his own party and making his party strong. Now the BCCi wants Amit Shah to help the cricket team by bringing Cook as an opening batsman because the opening batsmen on display in England were pathetic in their performance.
Amit Shah is scheduled to meet Cook anytime after the current series. The meeting will be held at BJP headquarters in Delhi. Amit Shah can also give him an incentive of becoming a future Rajya Sabha member to make it more convincing. The ball is now in Cook’s court to decide whether to extend his playing career or not. Once the Cook situation is dealt with, BCCI can then look into other players which it wants to bring to the Indian team, the likes of Kevin Peterson and Mike Hussey who can still contribute to International cricket.",SPORTS,Fake
Sony successfully inserts an Ad between bowler releasing the ball and it reaching the batsman,"Mumbai: People enjoying advertisements on Sony Pictures Network these days were left impressed yesterday when they saw an ad between the ball leaving bowler’s hand and the batsman hitting it with his bat during the ongoing coverage of the Indian tour of England. Throughout the series, people have applauded Sony’s commitment to advertisements but this was beyond expectations for even the biggest fans of the broadcaster.
While other sports channels have repeatedly interrupted advertisements in the past to show Cricket action, replays, batsmen coming and going, Captains setting fields etc, Sony has worked hard towards minimizing these distractions and concentrate on running uninterrupted advertisements. However, there was a gap, there was no ad during the time when bowler walks back to his mark, no ad during the time it was taking the ball to reach the batsman, and again no ad during the time it took a ball to reach the boundary line.
Now, Sony has plugged all these gaps and has added clips of advertisers at those times. Speaking to Faking News, an executive producer working for the channel said,” People watch Television to catch up with the latest advertisements. Those who want to follow the Cricket do it online on Cricket websites or on social media. Therefore, it is our duty to show as many advertisements as possible and we are working hard to give the best possible experience to the viewers. In future, we will also insert an ad break between bowler appealing and umpire raising his finger or shaking his head, an ad break between ball passing the batsman and wicketkeeper gathering it and an ad break between ball touching the stumps and bails falling off.”
As per sources, during Indian tour of Australia, Sony will experiment with an uninterrupted advertisement broadcast with the current crore being displayed on the top left-hand corner of the screen.",SPORTS,Fake
Ravi Shastri on Jadeja's exclusion in 4 Tests : Wanted to keep him as a surprise element for the next England tour,"London:Jadeja took four wickets in the England first innings, and then lived up to his keenness to be counted again as a Test all-rounder. Jadeja’s unbeaten 86, only behind his career-high 90 against England at home in 2016, pushed his case. 3rd day’s play raised quite a lot of questions on India’s selection policies. Jadeja never got a look in even on a turning track at Southampton. But coach Ravi Shastri has an explanation for the same as he believes that Jadeja’s exclusion from the 4 Tests at the beginning will help Idia in their next tour of England after 4 years.
According to Ravi Shastri, a team which wants to be the best has to have a long-term vision and winning the current series would have been a short-term goal. Shastri believes that the time Jadeja spent on this tour will help him become a better player come 4 years hence when India will tour England again. Shastri and Bangar’s position as coach was seriously questioned by the media after the team’s continuous failures to win overseas. Even in a recently held press conference, Shastri had said that this Indian team is the best in the past 20-25 years.
Shastri also spoke to our Faking News reporter and he had this to say,” Short-term failures are a stepping stone for long-term success. My visions are to make India the best Test playing side, Just give me 10 years more and see the difference. I have been working on the footwork of our batsmen by taking them to discotheques and making them dance, more they dance more will their feet move in the swinging conditions of England.”",SPORTS,Fake
"Survive for 1 more Test, then we are coming: West Indies Cricket Board to Rahul and Dhawan","Antigua: Indian openers may be struggling during the tour of England but happy days are just around the corner. West Indies, the great tourists, will be coming to India for a 2 Tests series in October and their Cricket Board, Cricket West Indies (CWI) has sent a message of encouragement to Indian openers KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan.
In an official letter, CWI has reminded the Indian openers that they are coming soon to India so all they have to do is to survive one more Test match in England and then they can go back to making hundreds for fun. Indian openers have struggled during the ongoing series against England with the opening partnership crossing 50 only twice and no opener managing to cross individual score of 50.
However, a home series against West Indies will be the right opportunity for them to hit form and confirming their spot for the winter tour of Australia.
Whenever Indian batsmen have suffered a crisis of confidence in recent years, Sri Lanka or West Indies have stepped up to boost their averages, West Indies even offered a great launch pad to Rohit Sharma who was averaging 288 after his first series against the Caribbean side, and they are ready to restore the confidence of Rahul and Dhawan after a forgettable English tour.
Speaking to Faking News, a CWI official said, “We heard some discussions that India should go in with 7 batsmen in Test cricket because the openers are not contributing at all and there is too much pressure on Kohli to score. Rubbish, they should go in with just 3 batsmen when they face us and we will make sure all of them hit 100s. We have always behaved well as guests in recent years and we will continue to do the same. All Rahul and Dhawan have to do is, survive the final Test with some dignity so that they get picked against us. We will prefer to concede runs to them than to some young kids picked for their debuts.”
As per sources inside the Indian Team, this message has really motivated Rahul and Dhawan and they are determined to score at least 10 runs each to confirm their spot for the series against West Indies.",SPORTS,Fake

They sent an investigation team to find out how and where are these bats used, as India’s baseball teams have never been in news.
The investigating team found that most bats are used during the road rage in Gurgaon and NCR region.

Karun Nair, who has been a passenger with the team for the last month, is worried that BCCI may send him a bill for his hotel stay, food and travel expenses since he has not been involved with anything on the tour so far.
Nair started worrying about it after the squad for the last two Tests was announced in which BCCI added in-form middle order batsman in Hanuma Vihari further reducing Nair’s chances of getting a game.
Speaking to Faking News on the condition of anonymity, a source inside the team said, “Till yesterday, Nair was repeatedly walking past Shastri and Kohli to remind them that he is also part of this tour. He thought he is not getting any game despite the struggles of the batsmen because they have forgotten about him.

पर सामने से जो जवाब आया उसे सुनकर शास्त्री जी की सारी की सारी उतर गयी। मैनेजर ने कहा, ‘सर पीने में 2 आॅप्शन्स हैं – चाय और काॅफ़ी। और वो भी सिर्फ़ एक टाईम मिलेगी – सुबह।’ फ़िर शास्त्री जी ने हँसते हुये कहा, ‘अरे भाई, मज़ाक मत करो। मेरा मतलब तो शाम की जाम से था।’ इसपर मैनेजर ने कह दिया कि वहां ये सब नहीं मिलता। तब जाकर शास्त्री जी को एहसास हुआ कि इस बार उनका गुजारा OYO Rooms में ही होने वाला है।

Serena Williams shouts,"Sports instruction does not allow any Tennis player to follow what has been defined as unacceptable in the match codebook. The rules are just right on purpose of maintaining the value of keeping a clean court at Arthur Ash stadium in New York.
However, the turn of occurrences in the final encounter of US Open Tennis Tournament belittled the vainness of rapport between the umpire and the player. The chair umpire Carlos Ramos warned Serena Williams for a code violation in regard to her coach’s instructive hint from the spectator’s box.
This objection caused Williams to make her blood boil and she branded the umpire a thief and liar. She also called tournament referee Brian Early to appear. Her reaction brought a game point to the Japanese sensation Naomi Osaka.
Angered with this unfavourable decision, the American tennis star enraged intensely at the umpire and could not stop herself saying: “It was not coaching. I do not cheat to win. I would rather lose. I just want you to know that.” Continuing further she added: “I understand why you might have thought that, but I do want you to know, I do not cheat. Thank you very much.”
Her furious volley in Ramos direction did not stop until she released her entire emotions. She pointed out: “You owe me an apology. You will never umpire on a court of mine as long as you live. You stole a point from me.”
Though the first set of the match ended in only 34 seconds, the second set brought an end of Williams’ expectation of winning 24th grand slam title equivalent to Margaret Court.

But the conditions remained true to the forecasts leading to the loss.” said a surprised Kohli. Flamboyant Virat Kohli preferred a chinaman Yadav over an indian Yadav after going through all the meteorological forecasts, which he allegedly thought were IMD’s.
As per experts, this poor selection of team haunted india throughout the play. To no one’s surprise Kuldeep Yadav hardly got to ball in seam friendly conditions. Several axed ex cricketers also expressed their disappointment over team selection. “Back in india, meteorological department follows certain rules and never spoil the surprises of weather by predicting them right. How come opposite of the forecast has not happened this time BC?” asked annoyed Kohli to indian origin reporter Indra dev in a never called press conference.
Considering the monopoly of BCCI, there are speculations that IMD will forecast overseas weather also for cricketing interests. “We have talked to senior scientists of meteorological department. They have made us believe that using cloud computing technology, each and every cloud above cricket ground can be controlled and regularly monitored. Team will be getting forecasts by IMD all around the world soon.” said a senior BCCI official when asked about all the buzz around.
Currently India are 2-0 behind in five match series. They had a dismal show with the bat at Lord’s. India were able to score only 107 and 130 in two innings of the match. Notably bowling spearhead Mohammad Shami single handedly made India cross the 100 run mark with his valiant effort with the bat. With his certificates and true age leaked back home by his wife Hasin Jahan, he certainly seemed to be only batter not missing the home conditions.",SPORTS,Fake
Players obstructing competition,"Why one sportsperson plays two games? This is so simply because of finding more scope in the choice. There has been noticed that a player playing hockey previously opts for the game of cricket. That player then snatches opportunity of another player. He definitely requires down-to-earth things in order to sustain in the sports. Thus he obstructs entry of others on the ground.
A few sportswomen played two different games at one point in time. An Australian player Elyse Alexander Perry showed her football and hockey playing dexterity. Another player Suzanna Wilson Suzie Bates from New Zealand was quite expert at doing the best in both the basketball and the cricket.
Further, Sophie Frances Monique Devine also from New Zealand played the hockey and the cricket with equal excellence. Above all, Elena Joy Tice of Ireland earned a name in the cricket and the hockey evenly. She has brought the silver medal for her team in the hockey recently.
These are some selected and glaring examples of international sportswomen skilled in two separate sports at one time. They have just achieved a position in their individual’s lives where they have also emerged as the champions in several ways.
They clearly realised it as vital enough to deserve a grand alteration in their games from one to another at one period of time. Who has not used two-camera mobiles? There are no dearths of students attaining double degrees. Actors are also regularly playing double roles in the films.
Even the double-decker buses are also not out of our queer sight. However, what surprises us most is the habit of developing an interest in two sports at the same time. For a few sportswomen at an international level, their devoted pursuit in two different games leaves us guessing what they are achieving.",SPORTS,Fake
Captain's team defeated,"Where was the captain’s team? Only Virat Kohli showed his confidence and scored a big run in both the innings. As many as three batsmen were declared at their very meagre score at the individual level. When India was aware of the fact that it had never won at Edgbaston, the players’ confidence level needed to be boosted. England may have been stunningly defeated at Edgbaston if our batsmen would have played in a more confident style. It did not look like a contest between the two cricket giants.
The English team’s winning tally was never been bad at this venue. What they had strategically designed became truly correct at the end of Edgbaston Test. We cannot avoid contributions of Indian captain Virat Kohli who played superbly well in both the innings. But the captain’s team somewhere failed to perform well. What a doomed day for our team!
As many as three players could not cross their individual tally beyond the score of 13 runs. Was it not their utter failure at the crease? It was on the seventh time that three batsmen’s individual score stayed at only thirteen runs.
More interesting than this fact was that India has not registered a win at this venue. It has lost six and drew one out of seven Test matches played at this popular ground. Pakistan and Sri Lanka have also not shown any victory in their respective eight and two Tests at the venue. How identical they are.
That was why Asian cricketers consider Edgbaston as English team’s favourite venue as they have lost merely eight matches and won a total of 28 Test matches.
Though this was not a big chase for Indian players, the swing ball demolished them. Previously, India lost chasing smaller targets of 120 in Bridgetown in 1996-97 and 176 in Galle in 2015.",SPORTS,Fake
Girls can be Arjun,"“Girls need to convince their parents that they can achieve their goals. There is nothing that women cannot do. She wanted to stand out from the crowd”, so said a determined and enthusiastic girl of Hisar in Haryana.
She on one occasion declared that she had a deep desire to conquer every mountain on this very living planet. This resolve for a young girl like Shivangi Pathak was no cakewalk. But she also wanted to do something different from the crowd.
This was her intense wish indeed. She was ready for any tough adventure. That’s why she opted for becoming a mountaineer and she joined an institute in order to settle on the last touches to the basic and advance mountaineering.
She also attended various high-altitude training in the glaciers of Kashmir. This activity is the job of her life, something that suits her absolutely. She proved her mettle by achieving the stunning feat of scaling the highest Asian peak, Mount Everest first.
Afterwards, she moved on to complete another accomplishment by surmounting every rigid and tough obstacle in reaching the heights of Africa’s highest peak Kilimanjaro in barely three days.
She achieved what she considered exactly to attain at a very young age. In such a youthful age of 17 years has set a new world record by neatly displaying a high level of climbing capability.
Extremely inspiring by the act of climbing Mount Everest Everest by the first female amputee climber Arunima Sinha, she has successfully carried out something which brought her praise, name and fame in this mundane world. She now turns out to be an example.
She is yet to go for another milestone when she expressed her desire to climb the highest peak in the European continent. This girl is very young, talented and spirited with extraordinary patience.",SPORTS,Fake
Getting no butter from the duck,"The hard-hitter Shikhar Dhawan departed quickly second time as the bowler beat him. This reminds us of Singh’s words, jab tak balla bolta hai, tab tak baat hoti hai. The cricketer is not finding his routine shot these days. He appeared to have fallen into some kind of unbalanced form. He did not fight as Ares himself on the ground.
He returned to the spectator area on zero in both the innings of the practice match. His twin failures in the warm-up match might make Rahul’s chance to partner Vijay stronger at the top of the batting order, as the experts analyse. Therefore, it becomes vital for him to spend some more time in the middle order.
He could not keep eye contact with the spectators anymore. He continued to stare at the real high jinks on the grassy pitch underneath his padded feet. Facing the opposite team’s fierce ball before the wicket was nothing less than standing before the enemy’s torrents of bullets like a war.
As he took a step forward from the wicket to move closer to the ball, his wicket was hit instantly. He stumbled and frozen with his feet rooted where he stood for playing the shot. Watching him made us feel as if a novice batsman getting to his feet on the crease and he surely would have growled at his utter dismal failures.
He bagged second repeated duck in a gap of just three days that was not only disappointing him badly at the present crucial situation but also sending him into complete desperation. He has failed to get the butter from the duck for the second time very much. Undoubtedly, no emotional apparatus, if any, help in expressing feelings and all those silent things going on in the brain after weighty position.",SPORTS,Fake
Cricketers to join politics now,"When we write about the success of Imran Khan in the political field, we do remember his world cup win in 1992. The subcontinental cricketers must be rejoicing at the Imran’s road to PM post. If Jemima Goldsmith had not divorced him she would have been the first lady in Pakistan now. It was all but correct that from one seat in 1994 to a few seats short of the majority in 2018 proved people’s huge support to him.
Seems to the cricketers of the Indian sub-continent would that they emerge like him one day. A cricketer has become the prime minister of the neighbouring country. As it stands he is the first international cricketer who got himself elected the prime minister. A notable parallel of him is a footballer Geroge Weah who was also recently elected Liberian president.
It is extremely smart on his part that he conquered the people’s hearts once again after the year 1992. This time far-off the very cricket playing field he has won the electoral battle. His stage is wider than his usual cricket pitch at this occasion.
His thoughts must have been wandered to the yesteryears when he had established his political party in 1996. He knows he only has urged for the political life.
Now the real work before him. He should converse with the subcontinent’s cricketers as to how peace would be established in three countries and how would friendship be strengthened. The cynics might say it was his destiny to lead Pakistan. A communist leader said he was a Pathan and we should not forget Badshah Khan was also a Pathan.
But who will take the fresh initiate or bell the cat first? India appears in wait and watch mode. His political success has definitely impressed the cricket players of the India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.",SPORTS,Fake

Youths should play Kabbadi,"There is no need to sell pakoda for becoming rich as was supported by our wily politicians time and again. It is not like by the youths as they aspire for white-collar jobs.

Though this game does not secure same attention as the game of cricket or football or golf or tennis draws, it has the capacity to enrich the player’s income in several figures.
If an educated youth would have qualms over selling the pakoda at a roadside corner, he would certainly not shy away from playing the game of long breath. It requires stamina, alertness and ability to hold back a gulp of air. As we were fully aware of the youths’ keenness towards fit and healthy body they should ponder over taking a deep interest in Kabaddi in order to turn out crorepati without much outlay.

There is nervousness in India cricket team because of its going down to the second position in ICC one-day international rankings. This is so after England has risen up by plus eight points in order to ascend at the number one position. That’s why the entire rumpus is being endured anyway.

Facebook is not closing the doors on the freshers who after all belongs to the most active users pool of its platform.

“No one is happy. The client-side project manager called me today to show their displeasure. They are asking me why we delivered the project ahead of time, he does not have a team to test it”, said Pradeep Kombettu, project manager of TCS.
Pradeep added, “We have to take the blame. My team is known for doing the work in sixty days that can be done in ten days. Even when we gave the delivery date as March end, customer will have its team ready to test our software package by May end only. After yesterday’s mishap went through the check-in list. My guess was correct, the active users of Instagram who have spent hours ogling at Alia Bhat, Katrina Kaif posts have spent their time doing project work during Instagram downtime”.
“During code reviews I have made it a mandatory checklist for reviewers to verify for a single line of code, there has to be at least ten lines of social media messages. Assuming that I prepare the project plan and bill customers. If we deliver like this ahead of time, the company would lose business and ultimately it would affect us all”, said Pradeep who has been asked to apologize to client and take steps to avoid this in future.

Person books 2 more cabs to reach the location where the driver of the originally booked cab was waiting,"With great technology comes great burden. Don’t know who said it but it is a reality. The online Taxi applications have made life easy but at the same time given us lot of headaches. Have you ever got a taxi at the exact location where you want it without the driver calling you even once? If yes then you are lucky. If no then you belong to the majority. Drivers find it hard to come to the exact location even with the help of google maps and other sophisticated location tracking technology.
Sanil Jain, an entrepreneur from Mumbai, who has made Uber taxis his office, to save the cost of renting a office space, regularly books 10-12 Ubers a day and works inside the taxis.  But most of the time he spends 15-20 minutes on a call with the driver to explain his exact location. So that comes out to be 150-200 minutes per day. That’s a huge amount of time in an entrepreneur’s life. But what happened today was historic. Sanil booked two more cabs to reach the location of the originally booked cab. So the total time he took to reach the originally booked cab = (15 + 15 +15 ) = 45 minutes.
This is a historic occasion and many people will start using it after this success story. Even Uber is soon starting the shuttle service to make you reach the originally booked Uber. This will also save the cost of developing a technology which would help a person reach easily to the location where his original cab is waiting. And also the revenue earned through the shuttle service will add on to the total revenues of the company.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake

With Facebook data proving to be not as private as one hoped, these youngsters are now worried that their exes will be able to see their profile visits one day.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, an FB user from Delhi said,”It is fine if they share our data with some data analytics company. They can target us with political messages but the joke will be on them, since most of the social media generation doesn’t vote in the first place. Real worry is if the data starts getting leaked to individuals and Priya starts getting a notification every time I visit her profile hoping she has lost hair or put on a 100 Kgs.”
Another user from Mumbai said ,”I regularly visit my ex’s profile to check if she is still single to make sure I still have a chance but if she comes to know about my twice a day profile visits, all my chances will be gone. She will think I am a creepy stalker which I am definitely not!”
Meanwhile, Facebook has refused to comment on this issue but as per sources, they are planning to leak the real gender of millions of “female” profiles on Facebook",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
Facebook to give out Work Experience certificates to those who have spent more than 2 years on the social networking site,"Amidst rising criticism over allegations of data misuse by Facebook, the social networking site is trying its best to stop angry users from deleting their account.
Sources within the company say that active users who have spent more than 2 years on the site will now be given a ‘Certificate of Experience’ as a token of appreciation. “It’s our way of thanking those who have wasted their time and will continue to do so on our site,” said a highly placed source within the company.
Many users welcomed the move and said that they finally have something in return for all the efforts they have taken for making Facebook what it is today.
Back home, the ministry of HRD has said that the aforementioned Work Experience will be given weight-age when applying for jobs.
Jobless engineers in India heaved a sigh of relief at the announcement and said that now have something to fill up thier CV with. “After graduating I spent most of my time on Twitter and Facebook. Almost 8 years to be precise. Now I can write about my Farmville and Mafia Wars achievement in my CV,” said Ranjit Nair from Bengaluru.
A formal announcement will be made by Mark Zuckerberg himself shortly where he will be handing out certificates to selected users from across the world.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
Scientists develop special vision red goggles will help people to be able to see their friends who vanished after taking money ,"Have you ever given money to friends or loaned some cash to relatives and never saw them again? If you have, then what scientists at AAAS have done will ensure you longer have to hunt them.
The scientists at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) have developed special vision red goggles; the ones that will help people to be able to see their friends who have vanished after taking their money.
The recent innovation was made public at a press conference organized in Chicago. The head of AAAS, Mr. Ronald Grump, demonstrated the features of the invention.
The team behind the development of this innovation was led by Mr. Kundar Pichai, an Indian-origin American. He said, “I was born and brought up in India. I shifted to U.S. 10 years ago. Even though I got out of India, India didn’t get out of me. I still remember every small trait that Indians possess. Back when I was studying at an engineering college in Mumbai, there were many instances when I loaned money to my friends either for a cigarette or for a date and many other reasons. And whenever I wanted the money back, I just couldn’t find them. It was like every time they just vanished. Last year, when I was talking to my son who’s studying in the same engineering college in Mumbai, he told me he’s experiencing the same problem that I and many other guys have faced. I decided that I need to do something to end this problem, using my skills and expertise. I was thinking about it sitting on my couch and watching Mr. India and that’s when this idea struck me.”
He further explained the product features, “Let me show how this works. As a volunteer, we asked one of our team members stationed in India, Mr. Gupta to lend money to a colleague who was asking him since a long time. He was reluctant to give him money because the last time he had lent the money, he was just not able to see or find him anywhere. We convinced Mr. Gupta to do the same again and use our product. So he lent him money for a month and at the time of recovering money, he used our product. He put on our goggles; roamed in his office as well as nearby areas and he found his colleague in the cafeteria.”
He showed the video demonstration, “As you can see there is a camera fitted on the top of the goggles. When Mr. Gupta removes the goggles, we aren’t able to see the colleague. When he puts them back on the colleague is visible. In the next update, we will also install GPS and sensors, which will enable users to trace them at their exact location and get notifications about the same.”
The product prototype is first going to be tested in the Indian market in the first week of March. We hope that the testing is successful and the product is fully launched so that we can avail the benefits of this product that has been tentatively named Finding Money.”",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
New Food delivery app using AI delivers food 30 minutes before one realize he is hungry,"Bengaluru: New food delivery app Wiggy delivers food at least 30 minutes before the person will realize he is hungry. Wiggy, which is revolutionizing the food delivery market says it is able to do so because it is first app in this segment that uses Artificial Intelligence.
While talking to us Wiggy founder, Sharat Kumar said, “Our logic is simple. No one knows when he or she will be hungry. Once you are hungry, you have to place order, then we will take another 30 minutes to deliver food. That’s a lot of time. Not many can control their hunger for so much time.”
Mr. Kumar added, “So, what we use is called big data mining. We know the behavior of the person, what he does throughout the day. In addition, we know outside climate, person’s eating pattern, what kind of food person likes. It’s a complex algorithm at work. We use it to deliver food in advance at people’s doorsteps. Good percentage of cases people accepted what we delivered and they have given positive feedback.”
When we asked what about food that people might not accept, Mr. Kumar added, “Our delivery boys take these food parcels and shout in front of hostels. Hostel ka food itna tasty hota hai ki, sab bhuke rehte hain dinvar. Jo bhi unko do, hostel students kha lete hain. Budget is a constraint for them. As they are our future customers, we give good discount to them”.
Manish Yadav, an engineering student who does not remember when was the last time he attended classes, said, “Yeh sab to theek hai. After Netflix has come, I am very busy. So much food lying here goes waste. We need a new app, which should send someone to arrange food in a plate and feed us when we would be watching our shows”.
Sharat from Wiggy said, “We are working on a new app called feedubaby which will do exactly what Manish wants.”",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
Elon Musk's company develops escape pod for the Indian market can be used to escape out of home when relatives arrive ,"Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, has surprised the world time and again with his unique innovations and inventions. His recent breakthrough innovation was the Tesla car and semi-truck. However, Elon Musk has recently executed a project for the Indian market that was for quite some time in his pipeline. His company has developed escape pods that can be used to escape out of home when relatives arrive.
Addressing a press conference that he had organized on Tuesday, Elon Musk said “India is very close to my heart. Whenever I invented a breakthrough product, I used to get mails and messages from my friends in India requesting me to innovate something for the Indian market. One day I was talking with a close friend from India on Skype and we were discussing, rather debating about a topic in aerospace engineering and then he had to leave because his relatives had arrived unexpectedly. I got a little vexed because I was winning. This is when it struck me that I should develop an escape pod for the Indian market that would help Indians avoid relatives whenever they want to. Yes I know the thought process escalated quickly but this is how I get most of my ideas.” Explaining about the product he added “The escape pod has been named Phir Se Ud Chala. The name was finalized after a lot of deliberation and research. This is how it works – When you realize a relative has arrived unexpectedly, all you need to do is sit on the pod and press one of the three buttons – Roam Around, Escape and Save My Life, depending on how badly you want to avoid the relative. The escape pod is enabled with collision sensors, GPS navigations, WiFi, charging input as well a display screen. All you need to do is just press a button and fly away. You can also set the duration for which you need to be away from your home, at the end of which the pod will bring you back to your home.”
This was when a reporter asked him for his views on the performance of current government. Unable to understand the relevance of the question, Elon Musk sat on the pod, pressed the Save My Life button and flew away.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
Man blocks promotional texts from Ola Ola CEO visits house with new offers ,"The Ola mobile application is being downloaded by an increasing number of people to get notifications about the attractive offers that the cab giant provides in every city, except the one the user lives in.
Many people have resorted to uninstalling the application in order to avoid getting disturbed while sleeping, taking a dump, travelling in an Uber, etc.
The mobile application, which sends notifications day in and out, was recently uninstalled by a Mumbai man after he got frustrated by the streak of promotional SMSes from Ola.
However, uninstalling the application did not give him any respite as the Ola CEO himself showed up at his house with promotional offers. “They would send me an SMS asking if I ‘want to ride back home’ when I was already home, and an SMS asking if I ‘want to reach office’ when I was already in the office,” said the man.
Frustrated, the man uninstalled the application only to find the Ola CEO at his doorstep the next day. “As soon as I opened the door, he started reciting all the promotional SMSes. He then requested me to book him an Uber cab so he can return home,” said the horrified man.
“I downloaded the Ola application so I can use it as the alarm. Forget waking me up at the right time, the notifications never allowed me to sleep in the first place. I got depressed and also lost my job,” said another man, who claims to have joined Ola as a driver after losing his job.
Ola drivers are lately considered notorious for cancelling rides at the last minute. “Next time around, I’ll uninstall the application and reinstall it just before the CEO arrives. That’s how Ola drivers cancel rides—at the last minute,” said another Mumbai-based user of the mobile application.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake

New app launched to inform what needs to be linked with Aadhaar before which deadline,"New Delhi: Government of India has launched a new app which would help people to know what needs to be linked with Aadhaar before which deadline. Unique Identification Authority of India (UIADI) which comes under the supervision of central government has launched the new app for Android, iOS as well as Windows devices.
While speaking to us, UIADI CEO, A.K. Pandey said, “It is humanly impossible to remember what all one needs to do to become cent percent Aadhaar complaint. I am doing it diligently for me and my family members for last four months, still there are so many checklists pending for us. Can understand the pain of my fellow Indians who must be getting a dozen smses everyday informing what all you need to link with Aadhaar.”
While giving us a demo of the app, Mr. Pandey said, “Click on one date, say Dec 31st, 2017, you will see what all you must link before that date like bank account, Mutual fund holdings, Pan Card, blah, blah, blah. Similarly, if you click on another date, say, Feb 6th, 2018, you will see a tab saying you have to link your mobile sim card before this date. There is a long list of items one needs to do as of today. Then Aadhaar linking is a never-ending process, time to time we will be keep on adding new items to the list”.
On the benefits of Aadhaar, Mr. Pandey said, “Long list of benefits already mentioned in UIADI website. If that is not sufficient, regularly listen to ‘mann ki baat’ and from time to time Jaitley Ji speaks on ‘cess ki baat’ where he and his finance ministry colleagues talk about Aadhaar benefits.”
As expected like any Government app, this app also crashed within minutes. People are hoping as deadline comes close many websites that demand Aadhaar linking will crash due to overloading which will compel Government to move the deadlines.

Mr. Ahuja shared some details on another advanced product they are going to launch soon. “Looking at the pollution level here, we feel after few days people won’t be able to see even their own hands, legs and feet. So, we will suggest people to wear multiple devices on various parts of their body. There would be a ‘master’ speaker which would say that’s your hand, that’s your leg etc.”, Mr. Ahuja said.
We spoke to Mr. Manoj Agarwal, who was standing in front of a shop in Gurgaon selling Toxic’s products. He said, “I am going to buy a dozen of them. How long inside our own home we would stretch our hands while moving around, touch each other’s face to know who is next to you?”

Facebook re-introduces marking “I am safe” for Delhi people,"Delhi’s smog problem is grabbing headlines all over the world. From BBC to WHO, everyone has shifted focus from finding flaws in Donald Trump’s policies to finding solutions to Delhi’s smog problem. And when it’s the whole world involved then how can a new social media country be left behind? Yes, you guessed it right. Facebook on Wednesday introduced its famous ‘I am safe’ button for all those who are stuck in Delhi fighting the thick smog.
Delhi’s smog is worsening by the day. There is no sign of it getting subsided. People all over the world are scared about their friends and relatives stuck up in such a hazardous environment.
So to make them aware of Delhites’ wellbeing, Facebook has launched its ‘I am safe’ button so that people can mark themselves safe and make their relatives all over the world feel relieved. We talked to Mark Zuckerberg about this feature and he said, “Every time there is a crisis in any part of the globe, Facebook launches that button so that people can mark themselves safe. Although, Indians mark themselves safe even when they are not there in that crisis. Like once I saw a Delhi guy marking himself safe during the London Bomb Blasts while sitting in New Delhi. So, as soon as the smog crisis occurred in Delhi, we received lakhs of emails in our inbox asking to create a mark safe option for Delhi smog also. And I cannot disappoint them.”
We talked to a few Delhi based students on this new feature of Marking Safe. One of them, Siddharth Arora, said, “I always marked myself safe in every crisis situation in the world even if I was sitting at home. Thank god and thanks to the pollution, now I can legitimately mark myself safe on Facebook.”
That’s not all. The Delhi CM has called this as a victory of Aam Aadmi Party. In his tweet, he said, “Delhi is thankful to Mark Zuckerberg for introducing ‘I am safe’ button for all the Delhites. Today Aam Aadmi has won again”. Though people trolled him and said, “We wanted to mark ourselves safe but you didn’t provide free wifi to us”.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
"IT engineer goes to office as per company wish, but comes back as per his manager wish","Bengaluru: IT engineer Prakash Hegde like most of his colleagues in IT city has ‘flexible’ working hours. The flexibility has a strong correlation with his manager’s wish what time he should leave for the day including holidays and weekends.
“I do not know how many of my colleagues have gone through the HR policy which clearly stated working hour is from 9 AM to 5:30 PM. Little I knew this will another HR policy like many other HR policies will not be followed neither in letter or spirit in the organization”, said Prakash whose day’s typically starts around 9 AM and ends somewhere close to midnight.
Prakash added, “Like every advertisement has a *Conditions apply. Our HR policy also stated sometimes to meet stringent delivery dates customers will want us to meet, employees would be asked to stretch beyond their ‘normal’ working hours. These ‘sometimes’ has now stretched little more than two years for me”.
“IT’s not that every single day customer demands deliverables. My manager who has the uncanny ability of remembering what needs to be done just before end of day. Another good quality he has, he will not force me or my other team members to deliver before end of day which means before next day sunrise happens. He will just say, ‘Guys let’s see what best we can do tonight’ before he leaves for the day”.
“Initially I left early and it showed in my appraisal grades. Then I understood ‘try your best’ means deliver at any cost. Otherwise be ready to be in the firing line”, said Prakash.
Prakash has some kind words for his manager. He said, “My manager is not that bad. He understands in weekends and public holidays he cannot force us to stay that longer. His ‘humane’ side comes in to picture and encourages us to live our live to the fullest when we do not work. I am writing a book, have titled it ‘working from bus & working for boss’ which is a tribute to the  traffic and my manager which dictated the kind of life style I have got in this IT city”.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
Teleportation-An old but new concept of time & space,"We all know about Narad muni. He travels from one heavenly body to the other in fraction of seconds. This is because, he may be using a time machine. Such a concept of time travel or teleportation is present in Vedas. Therefore, let us say, “Teleportation is the transfer of matter or energy. Transfer from one point to another at a long distance.” Thus, Teleportation is a peculiar phenomenon.In such a process, a person can travel a great distance in fraction of seconds.
The well-known scientist.
Heisenberg says “Quantum theory will not look ridiculous to people who have read Vedanta.” Neil Bohr statement- “I go into the Upanishads to ask questions.”
Upanishads, Vedas and Bhagwat-Gita
‘Siddhis” are spiritual and supernatural abilities. Rishis acquires them by mediation & yoga. Thus, they acquires power to control time and space. They also can transform the body. Therefore, they travel great distances in fraction of seconds.
The present research.
A pair of particles in the same quantum state ( same wave functions) interacts.Thus they  are entangled. Quantum entanglement   means connectedness.  Thus,the “Chetna” of both the particles is connected. Now, we separate the particles by thousands of kilometers. If we change the property of one particle, say “A”. The other, “B” experience the same change. Therefore, “A” can act as the teleporter & “B” as receiver.
The Indian scientist designs an instrument.
Teleporter break down the body into minute particles. Whereas, receiver re-materialize the body at great distances. This instrument is  also an amalgamation.A mixture of Indian meditation technique & recent engineering.
Meeting with Prime minister.
The Prime minister says. “keep the research secrete for twenty years.”   This is because of certain socioeconomic problems.  There is an agreement. Prime minister only can use the instrument. Therefore, he teleports himself to America & China & Russia & to any country of the world. But, only for the benefit of Indian people.
After 20 years.
India is now the super power. India is now world guru. It is now a hub for artificial intelligence. Hub for robotics & teleportation. Now, Modi Sahib retires from politics. He says, beam me up to Himalayas. Thus, the machine teleports him there. He starts meditation.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
Facebook announces Sanskari dating feature in India,"Back in May Facebook announced that that it will soon let its users create a dating profile to meet non-friends who have also opted in for its dating features. And since Facebook knows more about you than your mother or your ex-girlfriend. Facebook will match slew of your preferences to help you find the one, for you to date. Here is how Facebook dating feature might look like as published on the TechCrunch website:
Opt-in to a create a profile with just your first name. Your profile won’t be visible to friends, users who aren’t on the dating feature, and it won’t show up in the News Feed.
You’ll browse Events in your city and Groups that match your interests. You can select to “unlock” one for dating. You’ll then see the profiles of other dating users who’ve unlocked that surface.
You can browse through people’s profiles that show off a few of their photos plus some basic information about them. You’ll be shown people based on mutual interests and friends, plus other data Facebook has on you.
If you both are interested, you’ll be able to start a conversation with someone in a special inbox that’s separate from Messenger and WhatsApp. For safety, only text can be sent for now.
This works all well and good in parts of the world where dating is considered normal. In India however, things are different and Facebook knows it. To carter to Sanskari culture of Indian sub-continent, Facebook will be rolling out several additional features.
“We respect the culture and traditions of the given country, and hence it is our responsibility to adapt our services to culture, rather than trying to modernize it,” said Zuck while talking about the possible introduction of it’s dating feature for India.
“Our goal is not to imitate Tinder, we are trying to build a dating feature that is socially accepted by young and old alike. We want to help people build relationships that last longer than a couple of dates.” said a Facebook spokesperson when asked if Facebook is trying to poach Tinder in India. So here is a list of additional features on top of the aforementioned five points that would be introduced specially for India:
You will have to submit your Adhar Card to validate your identity before you can sign-up for the dating feature on Facebook.
Your parents will be required to approve you before your dating profile goes online. Furthermore, they will be able to ask for a second opinion from a close relative.
If your parents do not approve of inter-caste marriages, you will be required to upload your caste certificate. You’ll only be shown people who have opted for dating feature from your caste.
There will be a special ‘filter bride/groom by salary‘ feature alongside ‘occupation‘ filter. ‘We have taken inspiration from answers on Quora, thus we know how important these things are for dating/marriages in India’, said Facebook spokesperson while explaining the importance of ‘can/can’t cook‘ filter for women.
There will be an option to match the Kundli. ‘We know more about your preferences than your ex-girlfriend knew about you. We have designed algorithms that can predict the probability of the relationship working out or not in long term. But that is all useless if your Kundlis do not match.’ the Facebook spokesperson explained further on Kundli feature.
Once you select your potential match, parents of both party will have to approve on respective choices before you can interact with each other.
With Tinder is hugely unpopular among Indian parents. Seems like Facebook is focused on keeping Indian parents happy when it comes to their children’s dating life. Facebook seems to have decoded the mantra of India’s dating culture, ‘The secret to a happy relationship is when all your relatives are happy with your choice’.
P.S.: The sarcasm is not to be mistaken for criticism. It is the viewpoint of the author which you can disagree with. This post was not written to offend anyone. While Facebook has announced it’s dating feature, everything being said in this post about its introduction in India is fictional.

Profits from Dragonfly – communist version of Google in China will be used to promote ‘Human Rights’,"Amidst uproar in the ranks of its own employees, the tech giant Google released a statement that half of its profits earned from ‘dragonfly’ would be spent on charitable causes. Dragonfly is the name of search engine built by Google exclusively for China. This new search engine was tailor made to the specifications dictated by the ‘Techno-Proletariat’ the subcommittee that oversees online censorship.
In a special presentation that would be shared to employees, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google was seen explaining the reasons behind why Google chose to work with China. The text was released to media verbatim.
The Statement
“Yes! We went back. We went back on our decision. On the decision of not subjecting our beloved ‘Google’ to the obstinate censorship laws of Mandarin. But, there is another angle to it. From another perception, one can say, we have saved Google from even being used by the Chinese. True, Dragonfly is also our search engine – a product of Alphabet. But, it is not Google. For Google can never be subjected to censorship laws”, Pichai was seen emotionally speaking and vehemently supporting the decision of working with China.
“Well, being a self-proclaimed Communist state, China practices Capitalism more openly. On the other hand, America, the symbol of Capitalistic society is riddled with socialist policies where everyone depends on the government for social security. If we use migrants and blacks for target practice, for lack of diversified resources, China had to use their own people – and this specific act is seen by us as an inhuman activity” he reasoned out.
“For seven years… Seven long years, we have not worked with China. What purpose it did serve? Nothing. We lost seven years of revenue. And, fed up with our adamant attitude, China decided simply to make a Chinese version of Google. All that we could do was to cry a lot about copy right violations, had they made a Chinese search engine. We can certainly file suits and enter litigations and continuous arbitrations. But in the end, only Google would be the loser”.
“It was hence decided to give the Chinese what they want. After all, the Chinese government represents the authority of Sovereign Republic of China. And, the technical work that had gone into making ‘dragonfly’ was simply propping up few firewalls to filter out the content prohibited within the Great Wall. We know how annoyed our employees will be. So, we would like to use half of the income generated by the dragonfly on supporting human rights in United States, Israel and India. One may well ask why spend in countries that are free. Alphabet is a forward looking organisation and would like the free countries remain free. Moreover, this charity spend can be leveraged to improve our influence in these countries to increase our presence. After all, it is easier to influence free and capitalist societies.”
Footnotes
When one reporter asked Pichai that his statement raises many questions rather than answering questions asked, he laughed like a magician and said “I know that you don’t know even what to ask because you don’t even know that I know of any answers”. He patted the bewildered reporter and said soothingly “Don’t worry. Chinese government wanted to invite few journalists from America to witness and report on the performance of ‘dragonfly’. I suggest you to visit the Forbidden City and experience the dragon err… dragonfly. On your return, I will be more than happy to answer all your questions”. He sounded so confident, the reporter feared for his life and refused the offer then and there itself.

"Shirish Kunder’s Alien, abduct Tesla Roadster in Space","Washington DC: NASA has officially confirmed the hijacking of Elon Musk’s Tesla in space on its official website.
Starting this year, Elon Musk’s SpaceX launched a Tesla Car into space. While its officially confirmed that aliens from Shirish Kunder’s film ‘JOKER’ have seized the car but its exact location is not even traceable by NASA.
Interstellar director Christopher Nolan was sent as a good will ambassador from NASA to negotiate with the ace young age filmmaker Shirish Kunder but the dialogue failed when Shah Rukh Khan intervened inbetween who has ZERO knowledge about space and universe. But before leaving back to Hollywood, Nolan had an opportunity to catch up Shirish over his science fiction film ‘JOKER’ and appreciated his innovative ideas on film making.
Fakingnews reporter Geethanjali interviewed Shirish. Speaking to faking news, he said, “Life cannot be just about solving one sad problem after another from monday blues to no clues. There needs to be adventure and spice in life and universe inspires me. My alien friends have colonized space. Black holes are nothing but entry to aliens home, just like the igloos of snow which have a passage to enter the mini snow house, black holes are nothing but entrance to aliens kingdom.”
“I am glad, I wake up in the morning and interact with these aliens via Twitter. When I was a kid, I spent long hours thinking about space. Yes, its true that Tesla Roadster Car is being abducted but I support aliens, since they have saved the Tesla car from entering the black holes.”
“I feel sending a mannequin as a driver is not a wise decision. Many female aliens had started to flirt with him on ‘Aliens Tinder Dating App’. The dummy was so much in love with female aliens that he forgot about his space mission and was about to enter the aliens home to make babies and colonise Mars. Male aliens were envy of him as female aliens would prefer dummy human for date over them. This was the only solution and we managed to kidnap and shall get back the car on earth along with the dummy driver.”
“TESLA in space is now phrased as T:Tesla’s E:Elon S:Seduces L:Lovely A:Aliens. It is the sexiest car in cosmos and lady aliens enjoy the starry night car rides along with the dummy human.”
“I too have travelled in my white Mercedes many occasions to meet aliens in space but I don’t date anyone in space inspite of having many female fan followers in space too. We party in space with Chicken Tandoori and Kingfisher Strong Beer watching Stars and Moon. I shall start my first space film shoot on Moon this month and there after second schedule is fixed on Mars in May. I am short listing even aliens for my next science fiction film. Female Aliens are a huge fan of Ranbir Kapoor while males love Angelina Jolie. I show them films on my laptop. Aliens are constructing a cinema hall on Moon and it shall be inaugurated this year with my space film. My launch pad to space is at the Mangalore beach.”
Shirish further advised NASA and Elon – “DONOT PANIC”, since the car shall land safely along with dummy man on earth at the Central Park in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai on 4th April’ 2018.
We enquired more about his hidden secret life and space activities, to which Shirish replied, “Sometimes being alien is the only option.”

Apple launching new iPhone XI with Kerosene support,"Apple is going to launch a iPhone named as iPhone XI. The main highlight of the device (which was leaked from a anonymous site) will be performance.
The new iPhone would use kerosene in combination with lithium ion battery to perform better. One of the spokeperson of Apple said- It took us 5 years to turn this technology into RealityKings. This will further enhance the capacity of the Iphone’s Multitasking and some of our most revolutionary features which are least used like faceID, Animoji.
As they used to consume a lots of battery. When the phones battery is low it would automatically shift to kerosene. On kerosene it would make sounds like a stove which would make people around them calm. The people would have to buy a five liter revolutionary iKerosene tank to store it. Further to carry it revolutionary ikerosene tank apple has designed a ibagpack taking into considerations of the consumers.
In a tie with Govt of india, for making the availability of kerosene, Both GOI and Apple have reached to a single decision of- The kerosene for apple phones would be available at local public distribution shop and you should have a yellow card to buy kerosene. The terms of conditions would be decided by GOI: Every person having income lower than Rs 10000/- would be able to get yellow card. They have to apply to local RSS office to get approval for Yellow card issuance.Every person having in possession of yellow card who isn’t real beneficiary for that card would be given a latest macbook for half of the price but person himself has to buy its accessories.
Apple said in official statement: Its the new strategy of apple which has nothing to do with the strategy of removing 3.5 mm jack.

"Boy keeps charging gadgets, develops sleeplessness disorder","Delhi. Minku spends most of his time near the charging point. He keeps checking the battery of his gadgets, even at night. He has developed sleeplessness disorder due to this. In an interview given to Faking News reporter, his mom revealed the problem. According to her, the situation was normal till Minku used to charge his smartphone and laptop only.
Things started to go wrong after he bought a power bank. He started spending more time near the charging point, checking how much time is remaining for the full charge. Things worsened when he bought a fitness band and a wireless headphone in the sale.
Minku had the habit of sleeping late since his engineering days. But this time he has developed a sleeplessness disorder. In the initial stage, Minku showed symptoms of waking up at night and checking for the battery in gadgets. Gradually his frequency of waking up at night increased. Slowly he became Insomniac.
His mom told our reporter “Minku kept on buying new gadgets in big billion day sale. He said more shopping means ‘more savings,’ a concept which no one in our family could understand except Minku.” She further added, “There is a strange looking watch called fitness band, bought by Minku. He says that the watch will tell the number of steps he walks. The wireless headphones were bought for the morning jog. But there is no use. Minku does not go anywhere these days. He keeps charging his power bank, watch, headphones, in addition to phone and laptop that he already had. Minku’s problem is getting adverse day bay day. He keeps things on charge and forgets to switch on the charging point. Later he becomes mad at himself.

Rockets could be better for timely trip!,"KANPUR: Do we not grasp an idea of the day when there will start the rockets to take us? These will go through the roof or go sky-high to avoid wastage of time. Though the rocket science is often referred informally in our conversation, there needs to be deep thinking on making this science useful for the purpose of transportation.
Not only the time will be saved but the passengers will also experience in a way that feels like foreshadowing.
This alteration in transport may facilitate the passengers to end the war of words and the authorities concerned herewith would be saved from finding excuses in a staggered manner.
The air passengers were recently blatantly annoyed; everyone can suffer it, apart from the non-passengers. As many as 270 passengers of the Air India Mumbai-Ahmadabad flight created a rumpus at CS International airport following the delayed flight of close to seven hours. The delay was owing to non-availability of the pilot for the aircraft. The flight departure was due at 1.35 a.m. past midnight but it could take off at 08.20 a.m. on Saturday morning.
What a time has come! Since technological advancement has reached a very higher level, the traffic system still seems unarranged as it should practically be.
Modes of transportation continue to be revolutionized but its operational dexterity has not been gained.
The common passengers find the bus service inefficient, the rail service delayed and now the air service hopeless too. Faster means of moving, carrying, flying and shipping are not proving perfect in its functional form.
We seem to have not progressed much from bullock cart age particularly in relation to the time. The two bullocks-driven wheeled cart used to cover its distance by its own time slowly and steadily. More or less the similar situation prevails when we have much-advanced transportation.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake

Source stated, “After issues between founders and Vishal Sikka, we can’t afford to get this appointment wrong. This is going to be the most important CEO appointment in company’s history. There was a feeling that Vishal Sikka never integrated with company’s culture.”
Infosys always states it’s moto is “Powered by intellect and driven by values”.

Be online for further casual chat,"KANPUR: All the guests were full of beans at the party as they were talking, dancing and sipping coffee. None of them was really interested in leaving the place amid complete enjoyments. But the time came to depart and everyone moved away by and by. This life is different from the time when people used to inquire about one another’s well-being.  Now, the emphasis remains upon being online because this has been considered quite a humane way to converse.
Then, elders delighted in blessing the youngsters by saying, ‘God bless you.’ But presently we come across the oft-repeated term ‘be online for further conversation’. Every hand carries a mobile set which is featured with latest techniques. The habit has changed with the arrival of this electronic gadget in our lives. We feel elated at providing our mobile numbers to one and all as it facilitates easy exchange of talk between two persons or among several persons.
Just as the time of cigarette case or betel case has been extinct so as the usual query for ‘How are you?’ has been losing its importance gradually. There is really no time to stand and talk about this fast fad life. In case one appears on the mobile glass screen it is deemed everything goes well with that person. The clergy class bless us with the sentence, “May God keep everyone online.” There is a fashion in these things. At the moment this is a satisfactory manner for all the mobile users.
This change has not come from any force of law, fear or pressure. This sweeping change has taken over old and venerable tradition spontaneously. The way the mobile use increased in our indigenous lives, the customary style of conversation was almost gone. Nobody thought this time would ever come upon us. It is a bit of the electronic revolution.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
Trains under no setting reverse,"KANPUR: The train never stops to run. The train never looks back. The train simmers at all times. But one incident has tangled above avowals in disarray. A weekly Special Lucknow-bound train was wrongly put on the Allahabad track. It arrived at Kanpur Junction from Mumbai.  The train even reached Shanti Nagar crossing here. The staff realised the grave mistake and worked out a plan of timely correction of the erroneous shift in the direction. The train which was to move for Lucknow was on the track leading towards Allahabad. The train was directed to reach older British days’ capital rather to present-day capital.
Sooner the mistake was corrected by calling back the train after blocking that route. This was a firmly clear case of off the beam signalling. We were used to listening about the people boarding the wrong train. Due to lack of proper information about the trains the people committed this sort of mistake. When they learnt of wrong boarding it was too late. They had to get off the train at another platform. Some even followed chain pulling or jumping off the slow-moving train. They resorted to such risky method simply because of the fact that the train could not be brought back.
However, the recent occurrence proved of the train’s redirection on the backward station. If that train would not have been redirected to Kanpur Central there was no technique to send it to Lucknow. Ultimately the passengers had to face the brunt of the railways’ inaccuracies. The trains become late for hours. Was it not an aberration of serious nature? Movement of the trains depends completely on the signalling system. This was the case of route re-direction. It was not layman’s fault but the railways’ experienced hands did this type of blunder. What remained a matter of satisfaction was grabbing the inaccuracy within time.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake

While elaborating on the ‘typical Delhi culture’, he said, “It’s a Delhi thing you know. When ‘tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai’ doesn’t work then you whip out your gun. It’s done as a scare tactic and no to actually shoot someone.”
“I am from Lucknow and even fights over there done with tehzeeb. I would be treated like an outcast if I tried that in Delhi. So I had to carry a gun and a baseball bat in my car to just to show that I am part of Delhi’s high society,” he added.
South Delhi businessman SK Khurana, though hesitant initially, did agree that these things are common in Delhi and media shouldn’t overreact. “Why is that Arnab behaving like a rabid mongrel over this issue. If he hadn’t brandished the weapon then it would have been a national crisis,” he said.
“I remember once I had an argument with a man after he cut me in traffic. We were talking like gentlemen and sorting the issue when some bystanders got restless and asked when are we going to start fighting. They were not happy with our politeness and wanted to hear some cuss words,” he recollected.
A senior bureaucrat, while commenting in the incident said that people coming from outside should respect the culture of Delhi. “Please liberally flaunt your political connections. Invest in a gun if you can afford it, especially the high society types. Carry a baseball bat in you car to start a road rage without provocation.

On this auspicious day, devotees worship Goddess of wealth Laxmi and Lord Kuber.   The highlight of this festival is the unique tradition of buying gold, silver items or new utensils on this day.

As per old traditions and customs, Hindus clean their houses before Diwali celebrations and by the time of Dhanteras, they ensure that every corner is spick and span.   The reason behind this is that on this day, it is believed that Goddess Laxmi takes shelter in people’s homes. ""Dhan"" in Sanskrit means wealth.   Dhanteras is considered as an extremely auspicious day to make new purchases, especially gold or silver articles and new utensils. It is believed that new ""Dhan"" (wealth) or some form of precious metal signifies good luck and these new purchase is said to ensure the inflow of both wealth and luck throughout the year.   Nowadays, it is common for people to make other kinds of purchases such as automobiles or TV, refrigerators etc. This is why all major stores and outlets have so many lucrative discounts on Dhanteras.   There are many legends and folklores associated with the ritual of buying new utensils and jewellery.   According to one such myth, King Hima's daughter-in-law saved his son from the god of death Yamraj who had appeared in the disguise of a snake.   She prevented him from entering the room by placing a heap of gold jewellery and silver coins along with lots of diyas at the door. The glittering jewellery and the bright diyas blinded him and he returned without the King's son who was destined to die on the fourth day of his marriage. Similarly, buying gold and silver jewellery or new utensils is said to protect you against ill luck and is said to be the harbinger of prosperity.   On this day, people worship Goddess Laxmi and Lord Kuber by singing bhajans or devotional songs. In Maharashtra, Naivedya of traditional sweets is offered to the Goddess.  ",INDIA,Real
Soldier's Wife Delivers Baby Hours Before Husband's Cremation in J&K ,"Banihal/Jammu: Just hours before the mortal remains of Lance Naik Ranjeet Singh were consigned to flames at his ancestral village in Ramban district of Jammu and Kashmir Tuesday, his wife delivered a baby girl — the first child of the couple after a wait of 10 years.   The soldier was among the three personnel of Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry who fell to the bullets of Pakistani intruders along the Line of Control (LoC) in Sunderbani sector of Rajouri district on Sunday.   Two heavily-armed Pakistani infiltrators, believed to be members of the border action team, were also killed in the gunfight.   The tricolour-wrapped coffin carrying the body of the 36-year-old soldier reached his Suligam village on Monday after a wreath laying ceremony at Akhnoor Garrison.

Can Common Game Rooms for Children in Uttarakhand Villages Help Reduce Caste Tensions? ,"Any mention of the hill state of Uttarakhand brings to mind scenes of misty mountains, clouds and to some, even the earthy smell of marijuana. But to those living in the rural interiors of the state, the mountains are not a scenic escape but an insurmountable nemesis that often keep them from availing basic amenities that city-dwellers so easily take for granted. Take, for example, the easy availability for children to play games in their neighbourhoods. Growing up in cities with easy access to safe and premeditated spaces for studying and playing, one can often forget that these simple amenities may, in fact, be a luxury in remote areas.  Noting the difficulty, three student researchers have decided to bring about a change by creating games rooms for children in remote villages in Uttarakhand.  Former Jadavpur University students Payal Sarkar and Souradeep Chakraborty from Kolkata along with Ankaj Kumar from Ranchi University were working on their fellowship. The two-year programme required them to facilitate teachers and children of primary schools for better development of a child's growth and to create public system projects and they have been working in Uttarakhand's Bagheshwar district for almost two years now for the same.  It was while working in the secluded Pindar Valley when they noticed the lack of wholesome educational and recreation avenues for children in the villages of the valley. While villages and communities did have schools, these were often in dilapidated conditions with limited resources and teaching staff and were focused entirely on stoic teaching of theory, if so.  ""Children need more than just book learning to truly develop their personalities. We wanted to introduce recreation as a form of personality development where children can enjoy a more holistic approach to learning,"" said Payal Sarkar, a former student of international relations. She added that allowing children safe spaces for positive exploration of creative interests was important to their mental growth.  Some of the villages that they have been working in have no motorable roads and can only be accessed on foot, making resources very scarce. Darkness descends quicker on mountains and electricity is scarce, leaving children with almost no options for recreation and relaxation. At first, the trio intended the games rooms to be built inside the schools already present in the villages. But the idea was called off and the trio decided to make the games rooms in areas that are openly accessible to the entire community.  ""Only a certain number of children go to school. We wanted to build the games rooms outside of schools so that all children can access it equally, even if they don't go to school,"" Payal said.  Not All Play  Providing a common space for children to gather and play, discuss and participate in activities together is not just aimed at holistic personality development. According to the young researchers, rural Uttarakhand continues to be bound by a stringent caste system that often exhibits itself in the form of social discrimination and boycott. The problem is so pervasive that it seeps through even to the children. For example, Souradeep Chakraborty told News18 that in some villages, upper caste children refer to those from 'lower' castes as 'bimar' (sick). Many people do not allow members of lower castes to eat at their place, even at a wedding. 'Lower' caste guests are provided with rations and are expected to cook their own meal.  ""The problem of caste is deeply rooted and to weed it out, one has to attack the very foundation. Sensitizing future generations is one of the basic steps toward ensuring that such injustices do not continue,"" said Souradeep. He added that the community games rooms would act as a place for children of all castes and classes to play and enjoy together.The trio also hopes that by bringing children together, the common recreation centres would also promote healthy interaction between boys and girls. Many girls, especially in rural areas, continue to get married off as minors and often not allowed to mix freely in society after puberty or even continue their education. Young girls suffer various taboos including ones against menstruation. Payal has been trying to get the schools in the villages they have been working in to adopt a sanitary napkin vending corner for girl students and has also held sessions with children and parents regarding women's' menstrual and sexual health.  Ankaj Kumar, who has a BBA degree and hails from Bihar, has taken career counselling sessions in order to tell both men and women the professional options available to them and guide them into making more beneficial decisions in future.  ""Most children here grow up to join the army. It's the dominant profession here. And women are married off early so they usually don't work,"" Ankaj said.  The career counselling is important both from a gender and caste perspective as both engender professional side-effects. According to the researchers, most members of the Scheduled Caste were engaged in daily wage work and did not have steady jobs. Most of them worked as has and musk farmers. With the community games rooms, the researchers hope to at least generate a conversation and questions about oppression and discrimination among the youth instead of normalising it.A Hard Task  The trio has chosen three villages - Uniya, Sorag and Khati - all part of the Wacham cluster in Pindar Valley, to begin their first trial. These villages have near zero cellular network and were largely cut off from the modern world.  At first, the trio decided to first become part of the communities and understand their problems. Each adopted a village and underwent an immersion process in which they started living with people from the respective villages, even working there. They noted the schools in each of the village and started speaking to the village elders and teachers regarding the state of junior, elementary and higher education in Pindar Valley. After living over one and a half years of living in the district and closely observing the cultural and socio-economic fabric of the area, the trio decided to launch the campaign to improve the lives of children in secluded areas.  To start a conversation about creating recreational spaces for children was at first hard since most of the people were struggling to manage their incomes and other hardships that come with living deep in the mountains. The three students first approached parents and children individually and slowly involved members of local bodies and stakeholders to get the work started. In August, gram sabhas were held by the three in all three villages, which were attended by villagers as well as members of the gram panchayat following which they procured permission for the project. The villagers have allowed the trio to use certain existing building to set up the game rooms. However, the three are still short on funding.  They have managed to raise about Rs 25,000, Souradeep said. But they still need about Rs 75,000 to successfully build three games rooms and are still running an online fundraising campaign for the same.  Deciding content for the 'games' was also challenging as it involved coming up with ideas involving everyday things that would easily be available on the secluded mountains.  ""We designed the games in such a way that anyone could play them anywhere. They don't require any boards or dices,"" Payal said. One such game is a local adaptation of Chinese Whispers, another involves sketching.  Souradeep also has plans to create a book of illustrations that would contain stories told to him by villagers. He wants to print the book in several languages including in the local tongue 'danpuriya'. He has been collecting stories for months now and felt that the book would help bring out the personal lives and hardships that these remote populations suffer.If the first trial is successful, the trio plan to take the project forth at a state level and expand to creating library corners and other creative spaces for the young in remote areas.",INDIA,Real

Goenka is learnt to have informed Javadekar that the BoG was surprised that the Commission used rankings by a commercial agency to select only three public institutions from the EEC list. The selection, he is learnt to have written, was neither based on the findings of the EEC nor the government’s own National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF), reported The Indian Express.  Goenka reiterated IIT-Madras’s NIRF performance in his letter to the Union Minister and described the UGC’s decision as “unfortunate”, said The Indian Express. The paper further reported that Goenka wrote saying that the decision could affect the morale of teachers and students.  The EEC submitted its report where it stated that it could not find 20 such institutes that could bag the tag of IoEs owing to weakness in activities related to quality of research. The UGC then announced the name of the above mentioned six institutes.  While government institutes will be eligible for both greater autonomy and additional funding of up to Rs 1,000 crore, private institutes will not be eligible for any funding.  As per the guidelines, the Institution of Eminence shall continue to be ranked in the National Institutional Ranking Framework and, within five years of notification, shall get itself ranked in an international Ranking index of repute.  However, if the selected institution is unable to meet the goals at the end of fifth and subsequent years and there are grave enough deviations, The Ministry of Human Resource Development can ask for removal of the Institution of Eminence status and reverting it to the original status.",INDIA,Real

"In Paytm Founder's Extortion Plot, Another Ransom Call, Death Threats and a Shareholding Standoff Surface ","New Delhi: As the Vice President of Paytm and corporate communication face of the brand, Sonia Dhawan, spends her first night in jail, more than one version is coming up about what exactly lead to the arrest.   While the police is steadfast on the ransom call angle, Sonia’s lawyer Prashant Tripathi raised some key questions regarding the case on Tuesday.  Prashant alleged even Sonia was a victim of a ransom call. Her husband Rupak Jain, also arrested in the case, filed a complaint with the sector 49 police station on September 22.   The complaint says he had received a call, where the caller had asked for a substantial amount of money and threatened to kill him and his son if he failed to pay up. The lawyer alleged that the cops sat on this complaint for days and did not even check the number from where the call was made.   But what led to such a drastic change in relationship between Dhawan and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma?   Most journalists who have covered the start-up industry say it was almost impossible to bypass Sonia, if one had to interact with Vijay Shekhar. She had spent 10 years at the company and risen from the post of her personal secretary to the VP.   Tripathi suggests this could be related to the recent share repurchase plan of the promoters of the company. He claims Sonia refused to part with her share of the money and that could have led to this standoff.  The cops continue to maintain that Sonia masterminded the operation which involved three others, including her husband, to extort over Rs 20 crore from Sharma.   Some of those in the know of things inside the company also alleged about certain photographs which were used to by her to blackmail the Paytm founder.   But her lawyer asked the court why a shareholding employee who was promoted as the Vice President only a month ago and was given rather handsome bonus would indulge in anything like this.   While not denying that there were small tiffs with the Paytm founder, Tripathi maintained that those were not something for which she would damage the reputation of a company for which she gave her blood and sweat.  Three people, including Sonia and another Paytm employee, were arrested by Noida police on Monday for allegedly trying to extort Rs 20 crore from the e-wallet giant's founder after threatening to leak stolen personal data and confidential information.   All three have now been sent to jail after the court refused to grant bail to the accused.",INDIA,Real

"Feuding CBI Chief, Deputy Divested of All Charges; Joint Director Nageshwar Rao Takes Over for Now ","New Delhi: CBI director Alok Verma and special director Rakesh Asthana have been divested of all charges in the midst of an internal rift over bribery allegations against the latter. As per a government order, CBI joint director Nageshwar Rao will take interim charge of the investigation agency.  According to an order by the Department of Personnel and Training, Rao shall “look after the duties and functions of Director CBI and shall take over the duties and functions with immediate effect.”  WhatsApp Image 2018-10-24 at 07.12.31  The order implies that the government has sidelined all the three additional directors number three in the agency's hierarchy, including A K Sharma, whose name had figured in the complaint by Asthana, PTI reported. Sources told News18 that the offices of Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana will remain sealed while the case is pending.   Speaking to CNN-News18 on the rift within the probe agency, former CBI chief DR Karthikeyan said, “The government must have taken into consideration all facts, perhaps action could have been taken much earlier. This disaster could have been prevented by action on time.”  Rao, who hails from Warangal district in Telangana, is from the 1986 batch of Orissa cadre.  The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the CBI to maintain status quo on the criminal proceedings initiated against Asthana, who has challenged the FIR lodged against him on bribery allegations.  The case emanates from a statement recorded by a Hyderabad-based real estate agent Sathish Sana whose role was being investigated by a team led by Asthana in a bribery case allegedly involving meat exporter Moin Qureshi.   It was alleged that Sana had paid Rs 50 lakh as bribe to Qureshi, which was shown as investment in his company, to get relief in a bribery case.   A Special Investigation Team led by Rakesh Asthana was probing the matter and was repeatedly questioning Sana in this regard as it suspected him of lying in the matter.  A lookout notice was also issued against him by the investigation which prevented him from leaving the country on September 25, 2018, Sana had said in his statement which is part of the FIR.  The team also submitted a proposal to arrest him as it felt the need for custodial interrogation on October 20, 2018 before the director which was not cleared and sent for the opinion of Directorate of Prosecution.  ""The arrest is ordered only when certain parameters are fulfilled. The sanctioning authority satisfies itself whether arrest is warranted or not. The due procedure was followed,"" CBI spokesperson said on the question of Asthana's claims.  Asthana in his complaint to the Cabinet Secretary on August 24 had alleged that CBI Director Alok Verma had received a bribe of Rs 2 crore from Sana to help him get relief from repeated questioning.  He had also alleged that Verma had called him over phone in February to not call Sana for questioning.  In a surprising and unprecedented move on October 15, the CBI booked Asthana and investigation officer of the case on the charges of receiving bribe from Sana through middlemen Manoj Prasad and Somesh Prasad.  The CBI has arrested Devender Kumar, the Deputy SP and investigation officer, alleging that he had fabricated the statement of Sana purportedly claiming that a Rajya Sabha MP had met Verma on his pending case and assured him of relief and a clean chit.

"SC Pulls Up Centre Over Delhi Sealing, Says 'You're Stalling Everything' ","New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday pulled up the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs for ""stalling everything"" and not coming out with a procedure for issuance of notice to defaulters who have carried out illegal constructions in Delhi.  The apex court said the ministry seeking two adjournments for bringing the agreed procedure was ""too much"" and the attitude of the authorities concerned was that ""everybody is to be blamed except us"".  ""Why is your ministry stalling everything? They are stalling everything. For an agreed procedure, two adjournments have been taken. What is this happening? This is too much,"" a bench of justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta told Additional Solicitor General (ASG) A N S Nadkarni, appearing for the Centre.  When the ASG said deliberations were going on and the ministry was considering a rule book, the bench said, ""We will see the rule book. Everybody here is for a boxing match"".  ""Everybody is to be blamed except us, that is the attitude of everybody. It is just like going on in circle. Let us see your rule book and finalise it once and for all,"" the bench said.  The top court told Nadkarni that the ministry has to help the people of Delhi in this matter.  ""If in Delhi, you will fight like this then you will have to fight in all other parts of the country also. Why this confrontation?,"" it said.  Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, assisting the apex court as an amicus curiae in the sealing matter, referred to a report filed by the court-appointed monitoring committee.  In its repot, the committee has claimed that the Land and Development Office (L&DO) was deliberately attempting to stall the sealing operation of unauthorised constructions in Delhi.  The report said that official of L&DO has not attended meetings of the monitoring committee and he was not even answering the phone calls from the panel.  The ASG said that such an act was unacceptable after which the bench asked him to make a phone call to the L&DO.  The ASG later told the court that the L&DO was not well and was down with eye flu and he would file an affidavit in this regard.  During the hearing, the bench asked why the special task force (STF), constituted on April 25 following the court's order to oversee enforcement of laws on illegal constructions here, was not filing their reports in the matter.  ""What are we supposed to do? Your vice-chairman of DDA (Delhi Development Authority), L&DO do not do anything. Your ministry is not responding. I fail to understand what are we supposed to do,"" Justice Lokur observed.  The ASG told the court that he would place before the court an agreed procedure for issuance of notice to defaulters who have carried out illegal constructions in Delhi.  The bench has posted the matter for hearing on October 31.  The monitoring committee on sealing, comprising K J Rao, former advisor to the Election Commissioner; Bhure Lal, chairman of Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority; and Major General (Retd) Som Jhingan, was set up on March 24, 2006, by the top court.  The court is also seized of the issue related to validity of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006 and subsequent legislations which protect unauthorised construction from being sealed.",INDIA,Real
Sri Lanka Wants Chinese Help to Recover Phone Evidence in 'Assassination Plot' Blamed on India ,"Colombo: Sri Lankan police on Tuesday won permission from a court to ask Chinese phone manufacturer Huawei to help recover data from a phone used by a police informant who has alleged a plot to kill President Maithripala Sirisena.   Informant Namal Kumara said at a news conference last month he had discussed the plot by phone with a senior police officer. He has since been questioned but not charged with any offence.  Former Sri Lankan defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was also a target of the plot, Kumara said.  Officials at the Criminal Investigation Department of police on Tuesday told the court that some of Kumara's phone data, which could be evidence, had been deleted and they needed Huawei's technical help to retrieve it.  Sri Lankan law prevents police from asking Huawei to help without first obtaining explicit permission from a court. The court granted it on Tuesday.   A man named as M. Thomas from Kerala was arrested in Sri Lanka on September 22 on suspicion of involvement in the plot.   Thomas appeared in court on Tuesday and requested that he not remain in CID custody, saying there had been death threats against him by the CID. The magistrate denied Thomas' request.   The alleged plot briefly threatened to cause tension between Sri Lanka and India, after media reports that Sirisena had accused India's intelligence services of involvement — a claim New Delhi and Colombo have both denied.",INDIA,Real

Sharing his political vision with members of the Rajini Makkal Mandram, a precusor forum to his to-be launched party, he recalled his assertion last year that he will never allow those eyeing money and posts in his political innings and said it was not a mere rhetoric.  ""We are for ushering in a good change in politics. Why should I come to politics only to do politics like others..?"" he asked in a communique to the forum members, a copy of which was made available to the media.  ""The objective of our coming to politics is very very important,"" he said adding it was imperative to refrain from those who harbour ""wrong thoughts,"" and ""protect ourselves,"" an apparent reference to those eyeing politics to achieve self-aggrandising goals.  Rajinikanth also advised the forum members to take care of their families first.  ""No one need to take up Mandram's activities without taking care of their families,"" he said in a communique, a copy of which was made available to the media.  The actor expressed his views in the light of recent disciplinary action against some office bearers and a ""misinformation campaign"" that such steps were taken without his knowledge.  Defending the action, he said only those who had acted against the RMM's principles were removed.  Such people did not execute the task assigned to them and also prevented enthusiastic members from going ahead with the  work, he said.  ""I am well aware of the all the honest work and it will not go waste,"" the actor, who is the chief of the forum, said.  Rajinikanth, who had months ago disapproved those belonging to religious and caste based outfits from joining the RMM, said he had not asked any member to spend money for the forum.  The RMM has been working to enroll new members and expand its footprint across Tamil Nadu ahead of the launch of the proposed party.  He also said without the support of the people, ""We could not achieve what we aspire for.""  He made it clear that a membership in his fans club for 30-40 years alone will not fetch someone a post in RMM and make him eligible to involve in politics.

As soon as he stepped out of the assembly, Iyer-Mitra was arrested for allegedly hurting religious sentiments of people and making derogatory remarks against the state, the Konark temple and Lord Jagannath.  Iyer-Mitra was charged under various sections of the IPC on the basis of an FIR filed at the Saheed Nagar police station here, Bhubaneswar ACP (Zone-5) Kishore Mund said.  A complaint was lodged against Iyer-Mitra by Manoranjan Mohanty on September 20 for allegedly hurting religious sentiments of the people of Odisha.

"CBI War Plays Out in Court: Called a ‘Pest’, No. 2 Boss Asthana Says Will Disclose Shocking Affairs of Agency ","New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the CBI to maintain status quo on the criminal proceedings initiated against the agency's Special Director Rakesh Asthana and a trial court sent an arrested mid-level officer facing bribery charges to seven-day remand, as the unprecedented battle between the two top officers of the CBI entered the judicial arena.  During the court hearing, the CBI also submitted that charges of extortion and forgery were added against Asthana and Devender Singh, a Deputy Superintendent police of CBI who was arrested Monday by the agency for allegedly taking bribe and falsification of records.  After Asthana approached the Delhi High Court seeking quashing of the agency's FIR against him, a single judge bench directed the CBI to maintain status quo on the criminal proceedings initiated against him till October 29, the next date of hearing, but clarified there was no stay on the ongoing probe considering the nature and gravity of the case.  The high court asked both Asthana and Kumar to preserve the records of the case and also their mobile records.  On a day of fast paced developments, Devender Singh moved the Delhi High Court seeking quashing of the FIR against him and handing over of documents relating to the case.  This was followed by a similar petition in the high court by Asthana, a Gujarat cadre IPS officer, who has been continuously writing to the anti-corruption watchdog, Central Vigilance Commission, on alleged interference of the CBI Director in his probe in the case related to controversial meat exporter Moin Qureshi.  Justice Najmi Waziri issued notices and sought responses of the probe agency and its Director Verma as also Joint Director A K Sharma on both the petitions.  The notice was also issued to Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), which is the administrative arm for the CBI and whose permission is required to be taken for probes against bureaucrats.  The counsel for Asthana, whose name figures in the CBI FIR, pointed out before Justice Waziri that a case had been registered against the special Director based on a statement of an accused and said there is a great amount of ""sorrow"". However, the judge said this was not the stage to examine the allegation of malafide.  CBI's counsel said the FIR was registered under the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act and the IPC, including criminal conspiracy, and that they have added more sections against the accused relating to extortion and forgery.  The court turned down the plea of Asthana's counsel seeking to stay further proceedings in the matter. ""Nothing will happen. Tomorrow is Maharishi Valmiki's birthday, kuch nahi hoga (nothing will happen),"" the judge said and asked the CBI not to disturb the equilibrium on Tuesday.  The hostility was laid bare when during the course of the hearing, the CBI counsel remarked that Asthana's presence in the organisation was akin to pest in the wood. CBI's counsel K Raghavacharyulu, in an apparent reference to Asthana, said that ""if there is pest in wood, wood will become useless"". He repeated that ""wood will be useless, if pest catches it"".  Justice Najmi Waziri then interjected and warned the counsel from making such comments. ""Don't make such statements in the court. Don't use these things here. Such statements have no place in the court,"" he said.   Asthana, on his end, accused the agency's chief Alok Verma of trying to ""falsely implicate"" him in the bribery case to ""hide"" his own alleged criminal misconduct of influencing investigations in lieu of money.  He said his petition would disclose the ""shocking state of affairs and also reveal as to how the highest officer of the premier investigating agency of the country is trying to falsely implicate the petitioner, who is the second senior most officer of the agency, in order to hide his own criminal misconduct of influencing investigations in exchange for money"".  Kumar, earlier the investigating officer in a case involving meat exporter Moin Qureshi, was arrested on the allegations of forgery in recording the statement of businessman Sathish Sana, who is alleged to have paid bribe to get relief in the case.  He was produced before the designated CBI court which sent him to CBI's remand for seven days. The court termed the offence as ""grave"" and noted that there were serious allegations about the involvement of public servants including accused, who has been charged by the agency of being a part of an extortion racket being run in the garb of investigation.  During the proceedings, the agency also informed the court that it has added some fresh sections - 384 (punishment for extortion), 388 (extortion by threat of accusation of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life), 389 (putting person in fear of accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) - of the IPC in its FIR.",INDIA,Real

Fake Bank Apps May Have Stolen Data of Thousands of Customers: Report ,"New Delhi: Fake apps of SBI, ICICI, Axis Bank, Citi and other leading banks are available on Google Play, which may have stolen data of thousands of bank customers, claims a report by IT security firm Sophos Labs.  These fake android apps have logos of respective banks which makes it difficult for customers to differentiate between the fake and original apps, it said. The report further said the deceptive malware in these apps may have stolen thousands of customers' account and credit card details.  When contacted, some of the banks mentioned in the report said they have not come across any such fake apps. However, some banks have started inquiry and also informed the CERT-In — the national nodal agency for responding to computer security incident.  The fake apps target seven banks — SBI, ICICI, Axis, Indian Overseas, BoB, Yes Bank and Citi Bank — the report said.  According to Citi India spokesperson, the bank is not impacted by these apps as mentioned in the report. The bank has also written to the Sophos Labs to remove the Citi's name from the report.

According to the report, the apps lured victims to download and use them, either by masquerading as Internet apps or e-wallets, promising rewards, including cash back on purchases, free mobile data or interest free loans.   Some even claimed to be providing a too-good-to-be-true service, enabling users to withdraw cash from an ATM and have it delivered to their doorstep.

"Frenzied Protests, Casualties Expected at Sabarimala if Women Are Allowed, Kerala HC Told ","Thiruvananthapuram: Frenzied protests by Lord Ayyappa devotees leading to possible stampede and casualties is expected against the entry of menstrual age women into the Sabarimala temple during the annual pilgrim season starting November 16, the Kerala High Court was informed on Tuesday by an official.   Special Commissioner for Sabarimala M Manoj also informed that the protests may lead to chaos in Sabarimala, Pamba, Nilakkal and Erumeli (key entry points to the holy hills) during the three-month long annual season. He was appointed by the court to submit periodic reports on matters related to the hills and the shrine.  ""During the festival season, there will be large crowds in places connected with Sabarimala pilgrimage and these type of protests by frenzied devotees and protesters may lead to crowd turbulence and stampede which may lead to injuries to pilgrims, police and others and loss of life,"" Manoj said.  The report was submitted a day after the shrine closed at the end of the five-day monthly puja during which frenzied devotees of Lord Ayyappa, the eternally celibate deity, prevented around a dozen women in the 10-50 age group from entering the shrine.  Since October 17 when the shrine opened for the first time after the Supreme Court lifted a long-standing ban on women of 10-50 age group, its complex and nearby areas had witnessed protests against permitting women in the menstrual age group to trek the hill shrine.  Several organisations of Ayyappa devotees and political parties had launched protests in the form of prayer chanting processions against the permission granted by the top court to all women devotees to offer prayers at Sabarimala.  The protesters had set up tents in Nilakkal and gathered there in large numbers and began checking vehicles. As the situation grew tense by October 17, the Pathnamthitta district collector imposed prohibitory orders in areas falling under the radius of 30 km from the Ayyappa temple, the report stated.  Police had so far registered 16 criminal cases against the protestors, it added.  Tracing the events since last week, the report said on October 17, the law and order situation deteriorated at Nilakkal when a section of the crowd blocked women journalists, damaged their vehicles and resorted to stone pelting.  The crowd also damaged state-run KSRTC buses and police vehicles following which police used force to disperse the protesters. To ensure law and order, ADGP South Zone and Range IG, Thiruvananthapuram camped at Nilakkal.  The report also said there was unconfirmed information that some protesters of political parties were camping in and around the 'Sannidhanam' (temple complex) to protest and prevent the entry of women.",INDIA,Real
"Mohan Bhagwat Offers Prayers in Pune for 'Speedy' Construction of Ram Temple, ‘Ramrajya’ ","Pune: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday offered special prayers at a famous Lord Ganesha temple for the ""speedy"" construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, a priest claimed.

OPINION | Bad News for DMK Too as AIADMK Abandons 'Anna' for 'Amma' ,"A defining trait of Dravidian politics is the quest to wrest the legacy of a departed leader. It’s not just a symbolic, emotional quest, but one that defines the very existence of a political party, like the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).   Since its inception, the AIADMK never created the post of president in the party and the highest post within is that of the general secretary.  This was because the late MG Ramachandran, who broke away from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and founded the AIADMK in 1972, asserted that his eternal leader was DMK founder CN Annadurai and, hence, the highest post in the party was symbolically, eternally left for Anna.  MGR left the DMK following differences with M Karunanidhi, who took over as president of the party and chief minister after Anna passed away in 1969, and had to reassert that he and his party represented the true principles of the Dravidian movement as claimants to the 'Anna' legacy.  In effect, both Karunanidhi and MGR represented the same political ideology of their mentor; before the electorate, it was only a bitter personal rivalry that was a defining difference. This, and not just the influence of cinema, is the genesis of the personality-oriented politics in the state.   Cinema did fuel the rivalry and help build the personalities, but the reason the rivalry and personalities are so fiercely projected in the state is because without the personality rivalries, the AIADMK versus DMK battle has no foundation. In other words, there is no scope for an ideological difference or debate as both would be on the same side.   The rivalry had to be intense to fuel political differentiation and it manifested itself through the twists and turns over the last five decades. Most recently, it was this battle for Anna’s legacy that led to the dispute over granting a final resting place for M Karunanidhi, next to CN Annadurai’s memorial, at the Marina beach.  Since MGR was buried on one side of the Anna memorial, it was imperative for the DMK to ensure that Karunanidhi was buried on the other side to symbolically assert their departed leader as the political heir to Anna. The AIADMK dispensation tried to deny that space, but lost the battle in the Madras High Court.   Now, a renewed DMK, under MK Stalin’s leadership, is reasserting itself as the only custodian of Dravidian political principles of Annadurai and there seems to be no powerful counter to that claim from the AIADMK.  The ruling AIADMK faction in the state is fighting its battle within the party for the ‘Amma’ legacy. It is desperate to establish itself as the true custodian of Jayalalithaa’s legacy and that claim is being challenged by rebel leader TTV Dinakaran, who split from the AIADMK to launch his own party.   The core of the power struggle between the two sections is to wrest the ‘Amma’ legacy and establish themselves as custodians of it. The winner in this battle, in an election, would claim to be the heir to the late Jayalalithaa.   While their objective is to capture power in the state, like in the past, in the eyes of the electorate, they have no other explanation or narrative for political existence. But this battle is within the AIADMK as a party and not with a political opponent outside of it. The factions are similar in character and represent the exact same political thought feeding on the battle for legacy as a narrative for political existence.  The problem is that the AIADMK, in search of an ‘Amma’ legacy, does not have a leader of stature to challenge the DMK’s claim to represent the ‘Anna’ legacy. Though Jayalalithaa was not from the same vintage as MGR or Karunanidhi, she had the stature to reiterate the AIADMK’s position as a challenger to the DMK, but after her demise, there is no other leader to carry forward that challenge.   Arguably, the reason the AIADMK has survived is because Jayalalithaa was in power when she passed away and the party is surviving on the remnants of that victory.   In fact, no other political party in the state, barring MDMK leader Vaiko, has the stature to challenge the DMK as the most powerful custodians of the Anna legacy.   This is dangerous not just for the AIADMK, but for the future of Dravidian political ideology itself as it is the quest for the ‘Anna’ legacy that is the bedrock of the political narrative which remained between the two Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu.   And, it is because of the dominance of the AIADMK versus DMK personality battle that there was no space for any other political ideology to evolve in the state.   In this backdrop, when there is no challenge to the DMK narrative as the custodian of core Dravidian principles, the field is thrown open for a counter ideological force.  This is what the next election in Tamil Nadu will test and decide. The smaller question would be which of the AIADMK factions will wrest the ‘Amma’ legacy, but the more significant question would be whether the battle would continue to be fought among those who claim to be custodians of an ‘Anna’ legacy or will it eventually turn into one between an ‘Anna’ legacy and an opposing political force that has nothing to do with that legacy or even opposes it on an ideological level.   The answer to that question would lie in how the AIADMK recovers and if it does not, which political force will occupy the space of opposition to the DMK. In fact, this would be important even for the DMK from a long-term perspective.   Having an ideological opponent in the electoral fray is something the party has not experienced in the last four decades and, hence, it may have to see the collapse of an AIADMK with worry instead of jubilation.

"Got a Call from PM's Office When I Objected to Raising Salaries of MPs, Says Varun Gandhi ","Bhiwani (UP): BJP lawmaker Varun Gandhi Tuesday said when he raised objections about increase in salaries of MPs, he got a call from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), asking ""why are you increasing our troubles?""  During a programme in Model Women's College here, the Sultanpur MP said, ""I repeatedly raise my voice about the increase in salaries of MPs and not giving details of their assets. Employees of every sector get increase in their wages based on hard work and honesty. But in the last 10 years, MPs have increased their salaries seven times just by raising their hands.""  ""When I raised this issue once, I received a call from the PMO,"" he said. ""Why are you increasing our troubles?""  Questioning the education system of the country, he gave examples of schools in Uttar Pradesh.  ""In Uttar Pradesh schools, except studies, all programme are held. Religious and marriage functions are organised, after funeral, the rituals are completed on the premises. Children play cricket and leaders deliver speeches in schools,"" Gandhi said.  He said every year Rs 3 lakh crores are spent on education, but 89 per cent of the money is spent on buildings, which cannot be called education.  ""Today, 40 per cent of farmers in the country take land on contract, which is illegal because they do not get any help from the government, neither do they get a loan or compensation if the crop is wasted. In the last 10 years, the input cost for farmers has increased threefold, causing distress which led to suicide by 17,000 farmers in Vidarbha,"" he said.

Addressing a gathering of about 1000 seers from 13 Akharas (spiritual denominations) in Indore Tuesday, the godman appealed to uproot the BJP government in the November 28 polls.  ""(CM) Shivraj Singh Chouhan had promised me that the Narmada river will be kept clean and illegal sand mining won't be allowed. But these promises were not kept. Now we have understood that the Shivraj government is anti-religion,"" he said.

Many seers also attacked the state government on a string of issues including quota, construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, Vyapam scam and ""rising spate"" of crimes against minor girls, at the gathering.  Some local Congress leaders were also spotted at the gathering.  However, Computer Baba said the Congress leaders had nothing to do with the congregation which was open to all.

Sharad Pawar Reveals He Had His First Brush with Politics When He Was Only Four Days Old ,"Mumbai: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar had his first brush, literally, with politics as a four-day-old.

Pawar said he was just four days old when his mother Shardabai, who was elected as the chairperson of local municipal works committee in Pune in 1938, carried him in a state transport bus to Pune where she was scheduled to cast her vote.  Pawar said Shardabai was the driving force behind her seven sons and four daughters, all of whom acquired graduate degrees in various disciplines like law, engineering, architecture, metallurgy and agronomy.  The Marathi book, 'Mu Po Aai', edited by journalist Sandeep Kale, has articles by 30 Maharashtrian editors about their mothers. Pawar has penned the foreword for the tome.

"As Rajasthan Goes to Polls, Remembering the Stalwart Who Fought From 10 Constituencies and Won Eight ","A former vice-president of India and three-time chief minister of Rajasthan, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat is remembered as a veteran politician and a stalwart state leader.   Referred to as the ‘Lion of Rajasthan’, Shekhawat won his seat in every state assembly election, except in 1972.   From 1952 to 1998, the veteran leader fought 11 assembly elections and emerged victorious 10 times. Over the decades, he fought from 10 different constituencies in Rajasthan and won from eight of them.   As Rajasthan prepares for another assembly election, we take a look at Shekhawat’s political career on his 95th birth anniversary.  As a leader of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, Shekhawat was first elected to the Rajasthan legislative assembly in 1952 from Ramgarh constituency in Sikar district. Five years later, he was again elected to the assembly, this time from Sri Madhopur.  In the 1962 and ‘67 state elections, Shekhawat was elected as a legislator from Kisan Pol, the first time he chose to fight on a seat where he was an incumbent MLA. He met his first assembly election defeat in 1972, when he lost from Gandhinagar. However, in 1973, he won a Rajya Sabha seat from Madhya Pradesh.  During the Emergency, Shekhawat was arrested and sent to Rohtak jail in 1975. After that, he was again elected as an MLA for the Janata Party in the 1977 assembly elections from Chhabra.  Shekhawat became the first non-Congress chief minister of Rajasthan the same year, 25 years into his political career.   The Janata Dal government was dismissed by Indira Gandhi in 1980 and Shekhawat joined the newly formed BJP. With BJP, he was again elected to the state assembly from Chhabra in 1980, assuming the role of leader of the opposition.   After another stint as an MLA and leader of opposition from Nimbahera in 1985, Shekhawat became the chief minister of Rajasthan for the second time in 1990 after winning an MLA seat from Dholpur.  Shekhawat’s government was again dismissed in 1992 following the demolition of the Babri Masjid and the imposition of President’s Rule in Rajasthan. He then contested and won the assembly seat from Bali in 1993 and became the chief minister of Rajasthan for the third time, with the BJP emerging as the single largest party in the state.   In the next elections in 1998, Shekhawat was re-elected from Bali, but the saffron party lost the election. Shekhawat, for the third time, became leader of opposition.  In 2002, he was elected the vice-president of India. He later contested the presidential election in 2007, but lost to Pratibha Patil and resigned from the vice-president’s post.   In 2010, Shekhawat died in Jaipur due to complications stemming from cancer and old age, leaving behind his unique legacy in Rajasthan. Along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani, Shekhawat is credited with laying down the roots of the BJP as a national party.   His record in Rajasthan assembly elections indicated his state-wide appeal and in his five-decade-long political career, Shekhawat contested on different seats throughout the state and proved his mettle by emerging victorious.",POLITICS,Real

But what caught the attention of those present was Singh’s gesture of touching the feet of Adityanath, 20 years his junior.  Singh is the fourth longest-serving chief minister who is still in office and is several years ahead of Adityanath in political experience.   The 66-year-old joined the Bharatiya Jan Sangh when he was a student in the early 1970s and became the president of its youth wing in 1976-77, while the UP chief minister has completed a little over one-and-a-half years in office.

"Ajit Jogi's Alliance With BSP Will Hurt Congress in Chhattisgarh, Says BJP Gen Secy ","New Delhi: BJP general secretary Saroj Pandey on Tuesday claimed that the alliance between Ajit Jogi's party and the BSP would hurt the Congress more in Chhattisgarh as she asserted that her party will return to power for a fourth straight term in the state.  Pandey, a Rajya Sabha member and key party leader from the state, also said the opposition Congress is on the back foot due to the alleged involvement of its state president Bhupesh Baghel in a fake sex CD case, which she termed as an insult to the state's women.  The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had last month filed a charge sheet in the case naming Baghel and some others as accused in the case related to the controversial CD allegedly featuring a state minister, who had rejected it as fake. The Congress leader was released on bail after spending three days in judicial custody last month.  The BJP has used the issue to target the Congress, while Baghel has claimed innocence and termed it a political attack.  The state president of a political party should have applied his mind to decide what is in the interest of a state and what is not before putting out such content, Pandey said, dismissing his claim that he was not aware of its authenticity.   ""We are in a very strong position in Chhattisgarh. We will form the government for a fourth straight term,"" she said, adding that the BJP will achieve its president Amit Shah's target of winning 65 plus seats in the 90-member assembly.  The state will go to the polls in two phases on November 12 and 20.  Though Chhattisgarh has always seen a straight fight between the two national parties, the emergence of former chief minister Ajit Jogi-led Janta Congress Chhattisgarh has made things tricky in a state where the difference in vote share between the BJP and the Congress was less than one per cent in 2013.  Jogi, who was earlier in the Congress, has struck an alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which enjoys influence in some parts of the state.  Asked about the possible impact of the alliance, Pandey said influence of any party cannot be discounted in electoral politics but added that Jogi will definitely draw votes from the party he was associated with, a reference to Congress. Overall, the alliance will not be able to make much impact, she said.  The state government led by chief minister Raman Singh has done a lot of good work in different sectors in the last 15 years, she said, adding that ""pro-people"" schemes of the Narendra Modi dispensation will also help the party.  The BJP will see positive change in the tribal-dominated Bastar region, where it could win only four seats compared to eight of the Congress in 2013, she said.  The Naxal-hit region will go to the polls in the first phase on November 12.  In 2013, the BJP had formed the government for third straight term by winning 49 seats against 39 of the Congress but the opposition party succeeded in narrowing the gap.

"BJP to Have its Own Version of Diwali in Poll-bound MP, Asks People to Light Lotus-Shaped Lamps ","Bhopal: This time, Diwali in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh will be celebrated differently — two weeks after its actual date. The ruling Bharatiya Janta Party has decided to observe ‘Kamal Deepawali’ — its own version of the festival — in which party workers will encourage households in the State to light lotus-shaped earthen lamps.  “Our party workers are making preparations for this event up to the booth level,” Rakesh Singh, BJP chief in MP, told the media persons on Tuesday. “Letters jointly written by CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and I will be given to households, urging them to celebrate Kamal Deepawali,” Singh said.  Asked if it will lead to a poll-code violation as MP is going to polls on November 28, the BJP leader said the celebration should not be linked with votes. “We only said every household should observe this festival with lotus symbol. “So I don’t think this breaches poll code in any manner.”  Justifying the move of celebrating Diwali a fortnight later, the BJP state president said: “Traditionally, we light lamps whenever there is an auspicious occasion around. So we decided to observe this festival in the atmosphere of delight and let people bless us in the elections.”  The party has also decided to launch a special campaign in order to reach out to beneficiaries of various government schemes from October 29 to November 1. “Divisional, mandal and booth-level meetings are being organised in this regard,"" he said, adding, ""The party will seek blessings from the public for 'Samriddh Madhya Pradesh’ during the campaign. The beneficiaries will be requested to give a missed call or send a Whatsapp message on the prescribed number,"" said Singh.  Last week, the State’s Congress chief Kamal Nath promised to “expose” chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan through 40 questions in as many days ahead of the Assembly elections. Singh said public has a good understanding of issues and will form an informed decision. He added that at present Congress’s own existence is under question.",POLITICS,Real
"BJP May Drop Over Half of its MLAs in Rajasthan, Even Cabinet Ministers Not Guaranteed a Ticket ","Jaipur: The Bharatiya Janata Party is contemplating dropping more than half of its MLAs in Rajasthan in an attempt to protect its prospects from anti-incumbency, in what could be the largest ever-culling of incumbent legislators.   This was discussed at a three-day meet on the selection of candidates recently held in Jaipur, with Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje presiding over the meet. Sources said even cabinet ministers in the Rajasthan government are not guaranteed a ticket from their respective constituencies.  According to sources, multiple panels were set up and seat-wise discussion took place at the session, the second such discussion held ahead of the election. Opinions from local representatives, party workers and municipal councillors were taken over who could be a winning candidate from their respective seats in the upcoming elections.  The discussions were reportedly fraught with protests from party workers as multiple leaders staked a claim on candidature. On the final day, candidature for legislative seats from Jaipur city and Bharatpur region were discussed.   During the meet, BJP sought feedback from party delegates over sitting MLAs and on the chances of a repeat victory in their respective constituencies. The entire exercise was the first step in the preparation of the candidate list.   According to sources, BJP has sent a message to its cadres to ask for votes over the Lotus symbol of the party instead of the name of a local leader.   Sanganer constituency, where former BJP leader Ghanshyam Tiwari is an incumbent MLA, was a heavy topic of discussion and at least 12 BJP leaders sought to fight from the seat. Tiwari, a three-time MLA from the constituency, quit BJP in June and formed his own Bharat Vahini party.   According to sources, at least four leaders sought the ticket from Malviya Nagar constituency, where state Health Minister Kali Charan Saraf is a sitting MLA. However, dropping influential ministers and legislators from the candidate list could prove to be problematic for BJP.   During the discussions, leaders also deliberated over CM Raje running from Rajakhera constituency in Dholpur district. She currently represents Jhalrapatan in Jhalawar district in the Legislative Assembly and has been elected thrice as an MLA from the seat.   The candidate who emerges stronger in surveys and polls will be given a ticket, sources said. The first phase of discussions took place last week in Ranakpur, Pali district, where BJP deliberated over candidature on 102 seats. The remaining 98 seats were the topic of discussion in the second phase.  The election committee will now meet and deliberate over the panels set on 200 seats and decide the final list of candidates. The final nominations are expected to come after Diwali in November.",POLITICS,Real
"National-level Opposition Alliance for 2019 Lok Sabha Polls Unlikely, Says Sharad Pawar ","Mumbai: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday indicated that a national level pre-poll opposition alliance for the 2019 general elections was unlikely but said he was trying to bring the non-BJP parties together on a common platform to defeat the ruling NDA.  Pawar also said any party in the Opposition getting the maximum seats after the Lok Sabha polls could claim prime ministership if the Modi government is unseated. ""I do not see the possibility of a uniform national alliance since the political situation on the ground varies from state to state. I am talking to different parties to bring them on a common platform,” Pawar said during an interaction with a news channel.  He said the current situation in the country was similar to the one in 2004. ""There will be change in government in Delhi and Maharashtra. No single party can provide an alternative. I do not think Narendra Modi will be prime minister after the Lok Sabha polls,"" he said.  Nobody thought Manmohan Singh would become the prime minister, but he gave a stable government for 10 years, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief said. ""(Former prime minister) Atal Bihari Vajpayee's stature in the BJP and the country was much bigger than Modi’s. Still there was a change. There is never a vacuum in politics. There will be an alternative even now,"" he observed.  On being asked whether the NCP would support Union minister Nitin Gadkari, who hails from Maharashtra, as prime minister if the BJP-led alliance retains power, Pawar said, ""I would not support anybody from the BJP"".  He also said leaders such as HD Deve Gowda and Inder Kumar Gujral became prime ministers by ""accident"" and he did not want to be part of ""accidents"".  Asked about former finance minister P Chidambaram's comment that the Congress will not project its president Rahul Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate, Pawar said what Chidambaram said was the Congress party's approach.  ""During all my interactions with Rahul Gandhi so far, I realised there was no insistence on being the PM candidate face, but only change of the present government,"" he said.  To a question on attempts to project the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as a ""Modi versus Gandhi contest"", Pawar said, ""That is the BJP's strategy which will not work"". Asked whether any failure by the opposition parties to have a national-level alliance was a disadvantage, the former Union minister said, ""there will not be much of a disadvantage"".  ""We should accept the dominance of Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh, Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal... After polls, the picture of who will lead the alliance will be clear from those who get maximum seats,"" he said. He also ruled out merging his party with the Congress.  Asked about the Modi government's performance, Pawar said people's expectations from the present dispensation were not fulfilled. ""What was promised in 2014 is not seen on the ground after four years. (Former prime minister) Manmohan Singh tried his best to give a good government, intentions were best. That is not the situation today.  ""If the present government was effective, there would not have been bribery charges at the highest level in the CBI....He (the prime minister) should act,"" he said.  Pawar said Modi was a strong leader for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but not for the country. On demands to bring a law for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, Pawar, in a veiled attack on the Centre, said” ""The issue has come up since the development agenda has failed"".  Pawar also attacked the Centre over the Rafale jet contract and demanded a probe into the deal with France by a joint parliamentary committee. ""There is room for suspicion. So there should be a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe. If the BJP stalled Parliament for three weeks for a JPC probe in (the) Bofors (case), why should the BJP, now in power, oppose a JPC?"" he said.  Asked if he felt there was corruption in the Rafale deal as alleged by Rahul Gandhi, Pawar said he had no information about it. ""I only know the aircraft is good. Rahul Gandhi may have more information than me about corruption,"" he said.",POLITICS,Real
"JD(U) Says BJP Has Given a ‘Good Deal’ on Seat Sharing for 2019, But Not All Allies Like the Latest Formula ","Patna: Confusion among Bihar NDA allies over seat sharing for the Lok Sabha elections persisted with Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) reiterating on Tuesday it had negotiated a good deal with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP and Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party categorically denied any final understanding on the issue.  LJP parliamentary party leader Chirag Paswan told News18 that no final talks on seat sharing have taken place with the BJP. ""Two-three weeks back, BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav had started informal talks on seat sharing. However, it was stalled and we are waiting to resume discussion on this issue. I can't comment on news reports regarding what has transpired between the JD(U) and the BJP.”  Another ally RLSP also toed the line of LJP as its national general secretary Madhaw Anand told News18 that what JD(U) has said does not matter unless the BJP, being the largest ally, formally presents any formula on the negotiating table.  But Anand made it clear that his party won't accept two seats under any formula. ""We won three out of three seats in 2014 and our party has expanded its base since then. So there is no question of agreeing on two seats,"" he added.  On the other hand, a close associate of Nitish Kumar, reiterated that his party would either contest equal amount of seats or one less than the BJP in 2019.   “JD(U) has nothing to do with how many seats have been spared for RLSP and LJP. BJP has to deal with them. Whatever seats are left after accommodating them would be divided equally between BJP and JD(U). If leftover seats is an odd number then it will go to the BJP,"" he said.   He indicated if Kushwaha takes a different path then his two seats would be distributed among BJP and JD(U).   Going by JD(U)'s assertion, it appears BJP is ready to sacrifice more than two seats it won in 2014. According to the earlier 20-20 formula, the BJP, JD(U), LJP and RLSP were supposed to contest 20, 13, 5 and 2 seats respectively. The BJP won 22 out of 30 seats it contested in 2014.   However, Upendra Kushwha has throughout maintained that he will not accept two seats and would demand more than three, the number it contested in 2014. RLSP argues that it backed Narendra Modi as Prime Ministerial candidate when Nitish Kumar left the NDA and after his return to the fold it was BJP's responsibility to take care of their allies.   The party had directly blamed Nitish Kumar for creating confusion over seat sharing when he announced on September 16, while addressing party men in Patna, that he had sealed a Sammanjanak (respectful) deal with the BJP over seat sharing.  When asked about the latest murmuring on seat sharing, state BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said his party is determined to ensure a second term for Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. ""Our partly believes in cumulative effort and taking along all our allies in the state. We will not allow seat sharing to become a deterrent in our goal. A decision regarding this would be conveyed at an appropriate time,"" he said.",POLITICS,Real
BJP Postpones Amit Shah's 'Rath Yatra' in Bengal to December 5 ,"Kolkata: The central leadership of the BJP has deferred a ""rath yatra"", to be led by its chief Amit Shah, in West Bengal by two days in view of the party's Assembly election campaigns in other states, sources in the saffron party said.  Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state general secretary Sayantan Basu said Shah will now kick off the ""yatra"" on December 5, instead of December 3, from the temple town of Tarapith in Birbhum.  Five states — Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Telangana and Chhattisgarh — are set to go to the polls between November 12 and December 7.  ""Taking the Assembly polls into consideration, the party has decided to reschedule the dates for the rath yatra in the state,"" a senior BJP leader said.  The ""yatra"" will be taken to all the 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state — three chariots covering 14 seats each — he added.  Sharing the programme details, Basu told PTI, ""The first rally will begin from Birbhum on December 5. The second and third rallies will start from Coochbehar district in the north and  Gangasagar in the south on December 7 and 9 respectively. Amit Shahji will be present at all the three rallies.""  The tableaus will stop at various places for public meetings and interactions, Basu said.  At the conclusion of the ""yatra"", the party planned to hold a massive rally in Kolkata, which was likely to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he added.  Sources in the saffron party said the decision to take out the ""rath yatra"" was taken during Shah's two-day visit to the state in June.  Buoyed by its performance in the last panchayat polls in West Bengal, the BJP has prepared its 2019 Lok Sabha election blueprint, targeting at least 22 parliamentary seats in the state.  ""Bengal is of immense importance to our party as people are fed up with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) regime. We need to win the maximum number of seats from east and northeast India, especially Bengal,"" another BJP leader said.  The saffron party currently has two Lok Sabha seats in Bengal — Asansol and Darjeeling.  Senior TMC leader and MP Abhishek Banerjee said his party was not bothered about the BJP taking out any ""yatra"" as the people of the state were with the ruling party.  ""Let them take out the rath yatra. The people of the state will defeat the divisive politics of the BJP,"" he added.",POLITICS,Real
"Passed Over for Assam Gas Company Post, First-Time BJP MLA Quits Assembly ","Guwahati: First-time BJP MLA Terash Gowalla Tuesday said he has sent his resignation letter from the Assam Assembly to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.  The legislator from Duliajan constituency said he has sent his letter to Sonowal, who is the leader of the BJP Legislature Party in the state, on Monday night.  Confirming the development, a senior BJP party official said, ""Yes, he has sent the resignation to the CM's office on Monday.""  Asked about the reasons for resigning from the house, Gowalla said, ""There are various issues. I am not able to fulfill my duties as MLA. So, taking the moral responsibility, I am resigning from the Assembly.""  When pointed out that the issue of not offering him any post, particularly in Assam Gas Company Ltd (AGCL), during the recent appointments, Gowalla said, ""That is one reason. The AGCL is in Duliajan and people elected me as their representative. They had some expectations from me. However, without consulting me, the appointment in the company was made. I am not saying that you (government) give me the post, but at least I should have been consulted.""  Asked if there was any possibility of withdrawing the resignation under party pressure, Gowalla said, ""I have informed the issues to the CM. If I get a satisfactory answer, I may re-consider it.""  Gowalla told PTI he has not sent the letter to the Speaker, Hitendra Nath Goswami, which he will be doing after consulting the people of his constituency. When contacted, the Principal Secretary of the Assembly Secretariat, M K Deka said, they had not received any intimation about the MLA's resignation.  At present, the saffron party has 61 representatives in the 126-member Assembly.  Sonwal on Monday appointed various persons, including politicians from the BJP, AGP and BPF, as chairman, vice chairman and directors of 40 government-run bodies.   This included appointment of Sadiya MLA Bolin Chetia as chairperson and Indra Gogoi as the vice chairperson of Assam Gas Company Ltd.  Terming it as ""very unfortunate"", Congress spokesperson Rhituporna Konwar said, ""It is nothing but opportunistic politics"".  When people are worried about their own identity and a conglomerate of organisations have called an Assam Bandh, Gowalla resigned for his own benefit.

"Gunvant Patidar, Man Who Brokered Mandsaur Peace Deal, Quits BJP Ahead of Madhya Pradesh Polls ","Bhopal: Gunvant Patidar, who bailed out the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government during the farmers' stir in Mandsaur last year, not only quit the BJP ahead of Assembly elections but also alleged harassment by police at the behest of the ruling party.  The young leader confirmed the development to News18, saying he resigned from the BJP around three days ago as the party failed to help the distressed farmers.  Patidar on Monday submitted a complaint to the district collector and the SP that he was abused and threatened by SHO of Narayangarh over phone on the intervening night of October 21 and 22.  “If the administration fails to act upon my complaint, I am open to move court,” he claimed.  The Collector said that an inquiry will be conducted in the matter.  “Patidar has submitted a written complaint and call records of the said incident. He has also submitted an online complaint to Election Commission of India. An inquiry would be carried out in this issue,” Mandsaur Collector OP Shrivastava said.  Patidar further expressed disappointment over the fact that a clean chit was given to the cops guilty of gunning down farmers which was an injustice to those killed in the stir.  Patidar, who is associated with Naujawan Kisan Sabha which is part of All India Kisan Co-ordination Committee, denied any possibility of him joining the Congress. He, however, categorically accused the Modi government at the Centre of duping farmers by not fulfilling the promises made during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.  “If Congress or any other party makes concrete promises for farmers, we can think about extending support in elections,” said Patidar.  The 38-year-old had got elected for the post of Zila Panchayat vice president as an independent in 2015 but had later joined the BJP.  In 2017, Gunvant Patidar was assigned to force a compromise between the aggrieved farmers and the state government, after the government failed to reach out to the farmers.  Gunvant Patidar, along with other BJP leaders, accompanied the kin of farmers killed in the June 6 Mandsaur firing to meet Shivraj Singh Chouhan on June 10 when the CM sat on an indefinite fast in the aftermath of violence triggered by farmers' stir.  In the past, Patidar has been accused of his involvement in opium smuggling.

"Kerala CM Vijayan Lashes Out at BJP, RSS for Violent Protests in Sabarimala ","Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday attacked the BJP and RSS for the violent agitation at the Lord Ayyappa temple complex in Sabarimala over the entry of women of all ages into the hill shrine.  The agitation was a ""planned and deliberate attempt"" to create an atmosphere of tension in the state, Vijayan told reporters here.  The incidents of preventing women in the 10-50 age group from offering worship at the temple and attacking media personnel, who had come to cover the historic event, was part of a conspiracy led by the RSS, he alleged.  The government has the constitutional responsibility of implementing the Supreme Court verdict permitting women of all ages to offer prayers at the Sabarimala temple and no attempt to convert the complex into a ""war zone"" would be allowed, he said.  The temple in Sabarimala had witnessed high drama and tense moments for six days when it was opened for monthly prayers from October 17 to 22.  While maintaining that the faith of believers would be respected, Vijayan made it clear that the government had the responsibility to implement the court order.  He also charged that a ""heinous attempt"" was made by the Sangh parivar to communalise the state police, apparently referring to the cyber attack faced by IGPs Manoj Abraham and S Sreejith, who had been deputed to the temple to maintain law and order.  Vijayan also criticised the temple tantri, Kandararu Rajeevaru, who had said he would close the temple and go if women were allowed inside the shrine and the agitation by assistants of priests who had protested near the holy 18 steps.",POLITICS,Real

"Rahul, Akhilesh, Tejashwi Working on 'Strategy of Encirclement' to Checkmate PM Modi in 2019 Polls ","New Delhi: Congress president Rahul Gandhi views the grand old party as a feminine one, not in the Western sense of the word, but as more liberal and sensitive than the masculine, toxic, 56-inch chest thumping BJP, says a new book on young politicians.   In a soon-to-be released ‘The Contenders’ (Simon & Schuster) popular political talk show host Priya Sahgal profiles 16 emerging politicians with a prediction from veteran columnist Vir Sanghvi in the foreword that at least one among the 16 profiled in the book would be prime minister one day.   The author claims that Rahul, Akhilesh Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav and a number of other young guns are working on a “strategy of encirclement” to checkmate Narendra Modi-led NDA in the 219 Lok Sabha polls.   Priya’s profile of Rahul Gandhi is most engaging and insightful. It gives a rare glimpse of Rahul’s line of thinking in the context of his future role and strategy. Throughout her writings on present and generation-next of political parties such as Ram Madhav, Yogi Adityanath, Omar Abdullah, Akhilesh Yadav, Jayant Choudhury, Arvind Kejriwal, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Himanta Biswa Sarma, Kanhimozhi, Anurag Thakur, Harsimat Kaur Badal, Sachin Pilot, Tejashwi Yadav, Asaduddin Owaisi and Milind Deora, Priya remains remarkably non-judgmental, dispassionate yet astute observer of their political life. Her trait as a regular gossip writer takes a backseat as the book curiously avoids talking about personal scandals and some credible rumours.   According to the author, Rahul’s thrust on the Congress having feminine persona, has roots in the union of Shiv-Shakti where the qualities of both genders work in tandem to create a universe that is sustainable and well-balanced.   Priya recalls one of her initial one-on-one meetings with Rahul Gandhi when the UPA was in power and Dr Manmohan Singh had offered the young Gandhi a place in his government. “Rahul told me that he works according to no one’s timelines but his own. Rahul has certainly remained consistent to that line of thought. Impatient Congressmen may want him to be more aggressive and hungry for power, but he took his time to sip from the ‘poisoned’ chalice,” Priya reminiscences, adding, “he [Rahul] explained that he was not going to assume any responsibility just because it was expected of him. He would take charge only when he felt he was ready. Some would call this arrogance, others diffidence. In either case, it didn’t make the leadership manual.”   In the present context, Rahul is said to be working on a two-fold strategy to take on the BJP. The short term plan for 2019 is designed with the sole purpose of checkmating prime minister Narendra Modi at any cost. In other words, in Rahul’s scheme of things, it means being the smaller partner in some states during the coming round of general elections. Rahul’s sense is that non-NDA opposition parties are rather unanimous in not projecting any leader against Modi for they realise that to do so would be to fall into the BJP’s trap. The non-NDA opposition leaders feel that despite all their potential and promise, no young or seasoned leader from the Opposition is in a position to match Modi. “It’s better to fight him on issues,” Priya quotes Tejashwi Yadav and Jayant Choudhury as saying, “This is how we will cut them [NDA] down to size. We will not talk about personalities. It’s not one personality taking them on; in UP you have me, Akhilesh and Mayawati. If all of us come together and say the same thing, then it’s a strategy of encirclement.”  Rahul’s long term goal for 2024 is different. The Congress president hopes to establish himself as a credible prime ministerial face by then. Priya thinks Rahul will gain from 12 states, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat, which will help the Congress improve its tally in 2019. If the Congress crosses the hundred mark, she argues, Rahul’s short term plan will be in practice giving the Congress a relevant role in any anti-BJP coalition or as a more sure-footed leader of the opposition in parliament.   ‘The Contenders’ offers interesting debate around “youth” in Indian politics. Vir Sanghvi, in his usual candid style, points out how most “young” politicians in India are actually older than David Cameron who was 47 when he stepped down as prime minister of UK. “Put bluntly, India is a country of the young, ruled by the old and the very old. Something like 50 per cent of India’s population is in its twenties. And 65 per cent of the population is under 35. Yet, you will search in vain for a single minister who is under 35 in most Indian Cabinets,” Sanghvi says while giving a rationale that it has something to do with the circumstances that prevailed when India won Independence in 1947. The leaders of the newly free nation were people who had led the struggle for liberation from the British. Because it had been a long, hard battle, they were already quite old or at the very least, middle-aged, by the time they took office in the first government of free India.  Rahul’s long term goal for 2024 is different. The Congress president hopes to establish himself as a credible prime ministerial face by then.",POLITICS,Real
TRS Facing the Heat on Campaign Trail But Brand KCR Might Come to the Rescue ,"Last week, a former TRS minister in Telangana who was campaigning ahead of the Assembly elections in the state was gheraoed by a mob of farmers. The angry crowd stopped his car and refused to listen to him. What followed next was a halt in the campaign due to the chaos.  The incident happened in Wanaparthy district in Telangana. The farmers wanted an assurance from the minister that adequate water would be provided for irrigation.  This is not the first time Jupally Krishna Rao, Minister for Rural Development, was mobbed by people. Previously, he had to get on top of his car to pacify the angry crowd.  In the last one month, there have been at least seven such incidents where Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leaders, have faced backlash while on campaign trail. With villages taking oath to boycott elections and asking leaders to sign a bond saying that the promises would be fulfilled—the ruling party leaders are facing the heat.  Earlier this month, a farmer from Narnoor mandal in Adilabad district, committed suicide due to crop failure. Her husband had to carry her on his shoulders to cross a stream to reach the hospital. Sadly, the woman died.  A week later, residents of the mandal protested with banners saying “No roads, no bridges, then why vote? Do not come to our village asking for votes.”  In another incident, people from Wardhanapet in Warangal, protested against the local TRS candidate Aroori Ramesh for lack of development. Slogans were raised saying “You have no right to ask for our vote.”  These incidents are definitely a setback to the party ahead of the elections in December. With the anti-incumbency factor gaining momentum, it is not going to be an easy ride this time, say analysts.  But, will caretaker chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao’s image come to the rescue? Probably yes, say political analysts in the state.  “At the grassroots, the local leaders’ performance might not be satisfying, but TRS will have an edge due to KCR and his brand name,” Prof Nageshwar Rao, a political analyst, told News18.  The Chief Minister, time and again, has expressed confidence that the party would easily win at least 100 of the 119 seats. He had also said, last month, that the TRS had fulfilled all the promises made in the previous manifesto.  What came as a relief and a boost to the TRS candidates is the partial manifesto released last week. The manifesto, this time, includes allowance for unemployed youth, a higher pension pay, apart from the loan waiver. Analysts believe that the latest promises will give the campaign a boost and help the candidates in fielding questions on the ground.  Also, the opposition has not been able to galvanise the discontent into an anti-KCR narrative, which is another advantage of the TRS, apart from the chief minister’s flamboyant image, adds Nageshwar Rao.  What worked well for KCR in 2014 was the separate Telangana agitation. The fight for a separate state, in which he was at the forefront, helped him gain support from masses.  But, now, the situation is different. The focus is on the promises made and how much of it has been a reality? The questions is, are people of the state ready to give KCR another chance? Most likely yes, say analysts.  “The anti-KCR narrative is building, but I don’t think that is the situation as of now,” added Nageshwar Rao.  Telangana will go for polls on December 7 and the counting will follow on the 11th of the same month.",POLITICS,Real
‘Even If a Tsunami Strikes…’: Panneerselvam on Rumours of Rift With Palaniswami ,"Pudukottai (TN): Dismissing reports of any fissures between him and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami, deputy hief minister O Panneerselvam Monday said not even a tsunami can create problems between them.  Charging the opposition parties with trying to drive a wedge between him and Palaniswami, Panneerselvam said any such attempts from ""within and outside"" would not fructify. Panneerselvam is AIADMK coordinator while Palaniswami the joint coordinator.  ""Even if a tsunami strikes, the opposition parties cannot create a problem between us.

AIADMK founder, former chief minister MG Ramachandran is addressed as MGR while his protege and former CM J Jayalalithaa is Amma (mother) for the party supporters.   Panneerselvam's assertion comes weeks after his rival and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam founder TTV Dinakran made a sensational disclosure that former chief minister Panneerselvam wanted to oust the Palaniswami government with his assistance and had therefore met him last year.  Dinakaran had said Panneerselvam wanted to meet him as he regretted revolting against deposed party leader VK Sasikala and his subsequent criticism against the family.  However, Panneerselvam has denied Dinakaran's accusation that he wanted to dethrone Palaniswami and take over as chief minister, saying he has held the office thrice and was content.

Camping in Begusarai, he could be seen inaugurating Kabaddi tournaments, attending religious functions and seeking support for the October 25 'Bhaajpa Bhagao Desh Bachao' rally to be held at the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna.   However, controversies continue to dog Kanhaiya. During his Bihar sojourn, he has already been booked on three accounts — intimidating doctors and creating ruckus inside AIIMS, Patna, attempt to murder and inciting riots around a Durga puja pandal in Begusarai, and hurting religious sentiments of Hindus in his speech.  Kanhaiya, though, is unfazed and prepared for the long haul. He labelled the attack by the BJP to project him as anti-Hindu before elections. The young leader spoke to News18 about recent controversies related to him and his political strategy.  Here are the edited excerpts from the interview:   Q: You claim your convoy was attacked on October 16 at Bhagwanpur in Begusarai. What happened? Kanhaiya Kumar: We were returning from Mansoorchak after attending a rally. I was attacked near Dahia village under Bhagwanpur police station area by the supporters of the BJP's youth wing and the Bajrang Dal. You can easily identify them. They have uploaded pictures with Sushil Modi on their social media accounts. The attackers were patronised by a local BJP MLC Rajneesh. The intention was to cause harm to me and my colleagues.  Q: Is it correct that you were not stopped by them but you got off there to meet one of your acquaintances which resulted in a traffic jam in front of a puja pandal? Kanhaiya Kumar: No. They are two different issues. The puja pandal was behind us. There was quite a distance between where we stopped and the place of the puja. A police escort party was with us. You can ask them.   Q: Locals told me that your followers, armed with iron rods and hockey sticks, attacked them. They also say that your comment on Goddess Durga was in bad taste? Kanhaiya Kumar: Can you expect that a person who is starting out in politics will indulge in such things? And that too in his own constituency. These are all lies. And those you are referring to as locals are not common people but workers of the BJP and the Bajrang Dal. This was a politically motivated attack to tarnish my image and project me as anti-Hindu. They conspired to vitiate social harmony.  And one of the guys who was beaten up is not an apolitical person, but a member of the Bajrang Dal. Had we been armed, then 40-50 people would have been injured not one.   Q: How can you be sure that they were people from the RSS and the BJP? Kanhaiya Kumar: Because common people in Dahia village are least concerned about this. The BJP workers are fanning the fire. You need to understand the history of Dahia village. I know very well because my ancestral home is just about a few kilometres away. Some families there have been with the RSS for a long time. Bhagwanpur Chowk is the only stronghold of the Bajrang Dal in Begusarai. All their senior leaders were at the spot just after five minutes. How can this be possible?  Q: What happened at AIIMS, Patna? Kanhaiya Kumar: We went there to meet our AISF colleague Sushil. The hospital says I was with hundreds of supporters who scuffled with security guards and I misbehaved with doctors. Now my question is where is the CCTV footage? What is the evidence? If somebody was injured then where is the injury report? See, it's a conspiracy. The official Facebook page of AIIMS, Patna, describes me as 'anti-national Kanhaiya'. Can you expect a government body to brand me in such a way? The doctors who filed an FIR against me are associated with the BJP.  Q: Bihar's health minister and senior BJP leader Mangal Pandey has warned you saying Bihar is not JNU. What is your reaction? Kanhaiya Kumar: Sometime back the same Mangal Pandey said he is not aware about any Kanhaiya Kumar. Now he is saying, “Be cautious, it's not JNU but Bihar. How was he able to identify me now? I have not developed any family relationship with him.” The FIR was lodged by the doctors against me at his behest. MLC Rajneesh touches his feet whose goons attacked me in Begusarai.  Q: How can you say everywhere people are conspiring against you? Kanhaiya Kumar: This is for everyone to see. Lawyers were manipulated against me in courts, doctors were influenced to file a case, the Vice Chancellor of JNU was tasked to scuttle my PhD and now the BJP is using Goddess Durga against me. But I am not afraid.  Q: What is the difference between campus and electoral politics? What is the kind of feedback that you are getting in Begusarai? Kanhaiya Kumar: The people here in Begusarai are clever. No one can fool them. When sedition charges were slapped against me then also they stood behind me. None can mislead them. I will continue my political journey following the rule of the law. My opponents first tried to brand me as an anti-national and are now trying to prove that I a ‘goonda (hoodlum)’.   I will continue to follow the path I chose in the JNU campus. I will not compromise with principles. They (BJP) were defeated in the JNU and will face the same fate in Begusarai.   ",POLITICS,Real

Congress Nominates Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Niece Karuna Shukla to Take on Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh ,"Raipur: The Congress has fielded former BJP MP and niece of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Karuna Shukla, against Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh from the Rajnandgaon seat.   Shukla was among the six candidates named in the second list of Congress candidates for the assembly elections that will take place next month. Congress sources said that the screening committee of the party had recommended her name to take on the Chief Minister.   ""Shukla had been active in Rajnandgaon after joining the Congress. She is a strong candidate who will not only give a tough fight to Raman Singh but will also defeat him,"" Congress state communication wing chief Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said.  While Girwar Janghel will contest from Khairagarh seat, Bhuneshwar Singh Baghel will contest from Dongargarh-SC seat and Daleshwar Sahu from Dongargaon assembly constituency. The party has also fielded Channi Sahu from Khujji seat and Indra Shah Mandavi from Mohla-Manpur (ST) seat.  The Congress has declared candidates for all 18 seats that will go to polls in the first phase. The candidates for remaining 72 seats that will go to polls in the second phase are yet to be declared.  The former PM's niece has been vocal in her criticism of the Raman Singh government and had also accused the BJP of politicising Vajpayee's death by carrying his ashes across India for electoral gains in 2019.   ""The way BJP is carrying the ashes of Atal Bihari Vajpayee around the country, it is a show off and for votes. Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh and his cabinet never remembered him until now, especially when he had created the state,"" she had told News18.   Shukla, who previously represented Janjgir as Member of Parliament and remained an MLA in undivided Madhya Pradesh, had left the BJP in 2013 after accusing the party of torturing her ‘mentally’. This had ended her three-decade association with the party.   She had contested the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Bilaspur on a Congress ticket, but had lost to BJP’s Lakhan Lal Sahu of BJP from Bilaspur.  For Shukla, it would be the toughest test in her political career as CM Raman Singh is seeking a fourth consecutive term as CM after ousting Congress' Ajit Jogi from power in 2003.  The Congress is out of power in Chhattisgarh for the last 15 years. The BJP has so far announced candidates for 78 seats, including the 18 going to the polls in the first phase.

Rapes of Minor Girls Increased by 249% in MP: Kamal Nath Corners CM Shivraj on Women Safety Ahead of Polls ,"Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath, who has promised to “expose” chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan through 40 questions ahead of the Assembly elections, on Monday launched a scathing attack on Chouhan, alleging a serious surge crimes against women in MP since 2003.  “Under the BJP rule, rape cases of minor girls have risen by 249 per cent. In 2004, as many as 710 cases of rapes were reported in MP and 2,479 such cases were reported in 2016,” Nath claimed in one of his tweets on Monday, adding that 17,986 minor girls were assaulted sexually during the tenure of Chouhan.  “Over 25,000 women have been abducted and 46,317 rape cases have been reported in MP between 2004 and 2016,” Nath alleged. In the 13-year rule of CM Chouhan, 2,41,535 women have been subjected to various crimes, claimed the Congress president, adding that crimes against women have surged by 74.99 per cent from 2004 to 2016.  Attributing the findings to National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) report of Ministry of Home Affairs, Auditor Genera report and NFHS-4, Nath said the women of Madhya do not enjoy a safe environment as over 27,000 women ended their lives between 2004-2016 due to harassment, financial troubles and depression. Over 93,000 females suffered molestation in MP in this period, he added.  Convictions in crimes against women, too, are at an all-time low, Nath said, highlighting the 6,733 cases that are pending before various courts in MP since 2004 and atrocities on women have increased by 1,168 per cent. He said there are 85, 383 cases pending in courts since 2016.  He also blamed the Chouhan government pf poor prosecution, which, he said, led to only 27.8 per cent criminals getting punished in cases related to crimes against women.

'Being a Neta's Son is Not Anyone's Fault': BJP Gen Secy 'Defends' Dynastic Politics ,"Bhopal: Bharatiya Janata Party, a party that vehemently opposes dynastic politics in India, found itself in a tight spot on Monday when its national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said that being a politician's son should not be considered a demerit. The statement comes at a time when Vijayvargiya's son Akash is lobbying for a ticket in Madhya Pradesh.  When asked whether children of various senior politicians in MP, including his son Akash, should be considered for an election ticket by the party, Vijayvargiya said that it was up to the party to select a deserving candidate. ""The party should see the duration for which an aspirant has been working for it. The work should matter and not the political lineage as being a politician's son is not anyone's fault,"" he said.  If someone is a deserving candidate, then the party would consider his candidature, said the Mhow MLA.  Asked about whether he would contest assembly or the Lok Sabha polls, Vijayvargiya said he would follow whatever the party instructs him to.  The response from Vijayvargiya has come at a time when there is strong political buzz that his son Akash, who has been taking care of his poll ventures for long, could be fielded from Mhow and Vijayvargiya could opt for any seat in Indore or anywhere else in Malwa region where he enjoys sizable sway. Besides, Akash, several other senior leader’s sons are in the fray for election tickets in MP.  Meanwhile the senior leader discussing about Samriddha MP campaign, which the BJP has launched on Sunday, claimed the party received over 4000 phone calls besides Whatsapp messages of suggestions from the public on the first day of campaign carried out by 50 chariots in 50 districts.  Asked whether these 4,000 calls could also be considered an example that the state was plagued by problems, the BJP general secretary asked the media not to think by a negative perspective claiming it were all suggestions pertaining to Samriddha MP. To a pointed query as to why the BJP shifted focus from a Golden MP to Samriddha MP, a seemingly perturbed Vijayvargiya retorted saying it was matter of only perspective. When the MP would be Samriddha, it would be Swarnim (golden) also, he added.   Questioned as to when the BJP would start going to polls underlining its own achievements rather than talking about Congress government failures, Vijayvargiya said the benchmark would be the same even if BJP fights consecutive tenth election in MP. “We would still be comparing our government with Congress government of 1993 to 2003.”  He briefed the media about a meeting chaired by organizational general secretary Ram Lal in which the party discussed the election work blueprint as directed by party chief Amit Shah during his visit earlier. “Assessment is being made about areas where PM Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah and union ministers’ visits are required during campaigning,” he said. Senior leader Prabhat Jha has been assigned the task of preparing list of places where PM’s visits were required.  Replying to a query whether party patriarch LK Advani would also be invited for public meetings, Vijayvargiya said, “Yes, he would come, if the need be.”",POLITICS,Real
"Mehul Choksi Deposited Lakhs in Bank Account of Jaitley's Daughter, FM Let the 'Thief' Flee: Rahul Gandhi ","New Delhi: The Congress on Monday accused the Narendra Modi government of conniving with fraudsters who had escaped the country and claimed ""conflict of interest"" to demand the sacking of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, saying his daughter and son-in-law, both lawyers, allegedly received a retainership of Rs 24 lakh from fugitive Mehul Choksi.   Referring to the finance minister as ‘Jaitlie’, party president Rahul Gandhi tweeted that his daughter was on the payroll of “thief Mehul Choksi” when her “FM daddy sat on his file & allowed him to flee.” He used the hashtag - #ArunJaitlieMustResign - with the tweet.   ""You must have heard about Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, who had stolen Rs 35,000 crore of the country. Choksi deposited lakhs of rupees in the bank account of FM Arun Jaitleys daughter,"" the Congress leader claimed at a rally in Raipur in poll-bound Chhattisgarh.   He said the Finance Minister ""did not take any action against Choksi following which he fled the country, adding that Congress leaders gave details of these transactions in Delhi.   At a press conference in the capital, Sachin Pilot said Jaitley’s daughter Sonali and son-in-law Jaiyesh Bakhshi had accepted a retainership of Rs 24 lakh from Choksi's company Gitanjali Gems Ltd in December 2017.   “Is this not a clear-cut case of Collusion, Connivance' & Conflict of Interest' on part of FM Arun Jaitley? Why were FM Jaitley, his daughter and son-in-law neither summoned nor questioned by CBI/ED/SFIO?"" he asked, adding that was it not a fit case to sack Jaitley and conduct a full independent investigation.  Jaitley's son-in-law, however, has earlier issued a statement stating that his law firm had returned the retainership the moment they came to know that the company was involved in a scam. The finance minister has not yet responded to the latest allegations.   Pilot sought to know why no action was taken against Mehul Choksi, Nirav Modi, Geetanjali Gems Ltd and others, despite FIRs and multiple complaints. ""Who protected them?"" they asked.  “Why were daughter and son-in-law of FM Arun Jaitley paid Rs.24 lakh by Mehul Choksi's Gitanjali Gems Ltd. without doing any work, as admitted by them? Who else are the clients of Chambers of Jaitley & Associates' paying retainership of lakhs of rupees and why should their names not be made public, including amounts received?”  ""As people who owed money to Mehul Choksi/Nirav Modi came forward & deposited the money with Govt after their fraudulent escape, why did FM Jaitley's daughter & son-in-law redeposit Rs.24 Lakh in the account of a company that had defrauded the banks & people of Rs 26,306 Cr? Why did they hide it?"" the statement from the three leaders said.   The Congress further alleged that in the 44 months till January 2018, the Modi government witnessed an unprecedented 19,000 'bank fraud cases' involving Rs 90,000 crore.  Pilot said 23 fraudsters escaped India under the government's watch after duping the country of over Rs 53,000 crore. He said a sinking economy, banking frauds and flying fraudsters form part of BJP's-Jaitley's 'New India' and demanded that the minister should resign on moral grounds.   ""Successive escapes of Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and others reflect that Modi government is not a guardian of public money' but a travel agency' facilitating fraud, fleece and fly to foreign shores' of willful bank defaulters,"" the party said in a statement.",POLITICS,Real
"BJP Minister Subhash Deshmukh Accused of ‘Milking’ Govt for Rs 24 Crore, Taking Funds for Fake Factory ","Mumbai: Maharashtra’s state minister for Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh, who has previously been accused of scams, is in the eye of the storm again. This time, he has been accused by the Congress of forging documents and fabricating permissions for extracting funds from the government for a fake milk processing factory, which allegedly did not exist. Congress has claimed that the BJP minister and his son have duped the National Agricultural Department Program of Rs 24.81 crore.  “He has no right to remain a minister in the State government. He should resign immediately. He is clearly a scamster. He has abused his constitutional authority and defrauded the Government of Maharashtra. He has taken advantage of his position and authorities for personal benefits time and again,” said Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam.  Lokmangal Multi-State co-operative Society limited, the co-operative body in question, is chaired by Subhash Deshmukh’s son Rohan Deshmukh.  Documents accessed by an RTI activist (a copy of which is in possession of CNN News18), show that various government agencies including the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, Food and Drug Administration department, Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Public Works Department, Industrial Security and Health Department, have denied granting any permission to Lokmangal Multi-State co-operative Society Limited.  As per a letter dated July 2, 2018, the milk collection supervisor inspected the milk cold storage facility at Bibidarphal and milk processing units in Karmala, Sangola and Mangalvedha on June 26, and found that the factories were not processing even a single litre of milk. The letter stated, “The milk cold storage and processing facility of Lokmangal Multi-State co-operative society in Bibidarphal in Solapur is completely shut down at present. I attach herewith the inspection report of the Milk Collection Supervisor,” the District Information Officer said in his letter.  The set of documents show that Deshmukh’s co-operative society appended a letter of permission allegedly issued by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board on April 22, 2014, giving consent for the manufacture of processed milk to the capacity of 1 lakh litre per day. But when the RTI activist wrote to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board in 2018, it sent a written reply, saying no such permissions were granted by it to Lokmangal Co-operative society.  “We found that each and every permission was completely fabricated. The minister and his son showed false certificates of permission from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Deputy Divisional Engineer of the Public Works Department and Food and Drug Administration. These documents were submitted to the Maharashtra government to get funds under the National Agriculture Department Program,” Nirupam said.  “This is an old issue. We haven’t taken a single rupee till date. Making allegations is everybody’s right in a democracy. But I deny these allegations. They are totally false and baseless,” Subhash Deshmukh told CNN News18.",POLITICS,Real
"From Shahabuddin's Den Siwan, Tejashwi Signals He’ll Follow in Footsteps of Father Lalu Yadav ","Siwan: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Monday visited the ancestral home of gangster-turned-politician Mohammad Shahabuddin before leaving for a rally with his wife Hena Shahab in Siwan, where the writ of the incarcerated leader still runs large.  Spearheading the second leg of his Samvidhan Bachao Nyay Yatra, largely aimed against the BJP, the leader of opposition in the state signalled with the move that he would continue to follow the footsteps of his father and RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav, considering Shahabuddin's influence over minority votes in the state.  Before his conviction in the fodder scam, Lalu Yadav, amid a lot of hue and cry, had named Hena Shahab as a member of RJD's working committee. Shahab contested but lost the last Lok Sabha election to BJP's Om Prakash Yadav.  By all calculations Tejashwi has decided to field her again in 2019, one of the RJD spokesmen told News18.   ""That's why he is toeing the line of his father Lalu Yadav who always backed Shahabuddin, even after he was shown giving a verbal dose to the Siwan SP on the instructions of the Don in a sting operation last year. His steadfast support to Shahabuddin has played a key role in getting their support,"" he said.  Shahabuddin and his henchmen had murdered two sons of Chanda Babu in 2004 by drenching them in acid at the same Pratappur residence where Tejashwi held a closed-door meeting with Hena and party supporters on Monday. Shahabuddin and his three associates were sentenced to life in that case.   Chanda Babu later became an icon of resistance against Mohammad Shahabuddin as he continued his legal fight defying alleged threats from the gangster’s men. His third son, who was an eyewitness to the case, was also killed in 2014. While the opposition BJP hailed his courage and many of its leaders visited him, the RJD kept its distance from the family.  As Tejashwi discussed poll strategy and well-being of Shahabuddin's family with Hena and other party supporters at her residence, media was kept outside the residential premises.  Flanked by Hena, Tejashwi vowed to root out the BJP from the state in the next assembly election while addressing a public rally at Gandhi Maidan.

"BJP May Deny Tickets to Many MLAs in Rajasthan, MP to Stave Off Anti-incumbency ","New Delhi: The BJP is likely to deny tickets to many sitting MLAs in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the two states it had swept in 2013 but where it is now facing a renewed challenge from the Congress, in a bid to stave off any anti-incumbency in the assembly polls, party sources said.  They said the party may also not give tickets to three more sitting MLAs in Chhattisgarh, where it is yet to name candidates for 13 seats including four held by it. The party has already denied tickets to 14 of the 49 legislators who had won last time.  The sources also played down surveys predicting an edge for the Congress in Rajasthan, and asserted that there may have been some ""communication gap"" within the party earlier but things have changed.  ""We will come to power in all three states,"" a party leader claimed. Though he did not elaborate on the likely number of MLAs the party may not field in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, he said such a decision would be based on feedback from organisation and independent assessment carried out by the party.  Political observers say denying tickets to the MLAs seen to be unpopular in their constituencies may help the party placate voters to some extent.  BJP sources said Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan remains a popular leader and the first choice of the state's voters for the top post.  ""In such a scenario when the main face of the government is popular, any so called anti-incumbency can be effectively countered with some measures, including dropping unpopular MLAs,"" they said.  The BJP, especially after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and its president Amit Shah's ascent to leadership, has relied on intensive fieldwork to select its candidates. It has not shied away from dropping any incumbent lawmaker, who, it believes, may have become a liability or whose replacement has a better prospect at the hustings.  In the 230-member Madhya Pradesh assembly and 200-member Rajasthan assembly, the BJP had won 165 and 163 seats respectively in the 2013 polls. The party has been in power in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, whose assembly has 90 members, since 2003 while Rajasthan has an over two-decade-old history of voting out the incumbent party.",POLITICS,Real

He said the BJP had earlier presented the face of Chief Minister Raje for the forthcoming Assembly elections but now they have shifted towards the party symbol ""Kamal ka Phool"".   ""'Kamal ka phool' was forgotten (in 2014-Lok sabha elections) when the BJP gave the slogan 'Abki Baar Modi Sarkar' instead of 'BJP sarkar'. The party earlier presented Raje's face for the election but now they are for the lotus symbol. The BJP president should clarify his stand,"" Gehlot said, while accusing the saffron party of misleading people for seeking votes.  Asked about his recent comment that nobody ""knows before-hand who will become Kaun Banega crorepati"" in response to a question on who would be the chief minister if the party won, he said, ""the game has not begun yet"".   Gehlot also accused the state government of weakening the MGNREGA and making no arrangements in view of a likely drought.   ""The CM is not focusing on villages affected by drought and is busy making hollow announcements,"" he said.  He also said the government had failed to manage the situation of seasonal diseases in the state.  Gehlot said the fair price shops were distributing slips with the lotus flower printed on it, the point of sale (PoS) machines had the symbol as well, the Bhamashah card has the CM's photo and mobile phones are distributed under the Bhamashah digital family in violation of the code of conduct.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 Smartphone Processor Launched: Everything You Need to Know ,"While high-end devices in the smartphone industry, like the Samsung Galaxy S9 lineup, LG G7 ThinQ, and Google Pixel, are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845, the company is introducing a mid-range chip that can support the premium qualities that are no long exclusive to these flagship phones. These choice features are possible thanks to the Qualcomm AI Engine, Qualcomm Spectra ISP, Qualcomm Kryo CPU, and Qualcomm Adreno GPU that make up the system which ""bring new experiences to consumers globally,"" according to company VP of product management, Kedar Kondap. With the development of this chip, you no longer have to be the owner of an iPhone XS for a high-quality mobile gaming experience, ""epic"" selfies, and an advanced AI assistant.  As Qualcomm stated, ""the most advanced games demand a lot out of a smartphone,"" like high frame-rates and specific APIs, for example. The Snapdragon 675 takes all of these into account, while the chip is also optimized for popular games and game engines such as Unity, Unreal, and Messiah. The Snapdragon 675 also bows to the trend of numerous AI-assisted camera lenses on a single device by supporting a triple camera configuration compatible with telephoto, wide angle, and super-wide-angle lenses. Additionally, the chip supports an enhanced portrait mode and limitless slow-motion all in HD with help from the AI to optimally shoot media.  In general, though, the multi-core AI engine supports far more than just the camera of a device. The software is engineered to become the ultimate assistant by, ""learning and adapting to a user's voice, and optimizing battery life."" It can support device security and translation, as well.  The 675 is expected to be implemented into consumer phones in Q1 of 2019, but with the mobile platform already being available today, developers can get started creating apps, services, and other features that optimize this new generation system-on-chip.",TECHNOLOGY,Real

This time around, the Unicode Consortium has confirmed that there are 236 draft candidates in place for the Emoji 12.0 beta package. At the same time, Apple is working on the new emojis for next year, even as it prepares to ship the Emoji 11 update for this year with the upcoming iOS 12.1 software for iPhones and iPads.   The Unicode Consortium’s Emoji 12.0 Beta focuses on new emojis that illustrate human disabilities, such as a human ear which is wearing a hearing aid, male and female emojis signifying hearing disabilities, communicating with sign language, a male and female with a cane, a male and female in a wheelchair and a guide dog, for instance. At present, Apple, Google, Facebook, Adobe, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, Netflix, Oracle, SAP and Shopify are some of the consortium members.   The 236 draft candidates for Emoji 12.0 include 209 emojis related to people, 7 related to animals and nature, 6 new emojis for travel and 15 emojis for objects, among others. It is expected that Emoji 12.0 will roll out for use by software developers in March. It may be some time before phone makers and app companies including Apple, Google and Samsung actually deploy these new emojis. It is expected that Apple will integrate these in next year’s iOS 13 update, which should be unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) with the final release for all users later in the year.

Sure, notches have a practical purpose like housing camera lenses, speakers, and a variety of sensors, nevertheless, they have a reputation for being so unaesthetic that some Pixel 3 users have been digging into their phones' user settings to hide the notch completely by implementing a screen-wide black bar.  And it looks like Samsung wants to avoid the notch and a black bar after what Ice Universe revealed was on show at the incredibly private 2018 Samsung OLED Forum at the Shenzhen Marriott Hotel in China with about 20 business partners present, according to Forbes.   View image on Twitter View image on Twitter  Ice universe @UniverseIce  Great news! Samsung established the direction of mobile phone design in 2019! On October 18th, Samsung Display invited about 20 customers to hold the ""2018 Samsung OLED Forum"" at the Shenzhen Marriott Hotel in China. At the meeting, Samsung showed a PPT  5:16 PM - Oct 19, 2018 1,994 730 people are talking about this Twitter Ads info and privacy    During a PowerPoint presentation, the company revealed four new technologies that will drive their smartphone development over the upcoming year: FoD (fingerprint sensing tech under the display), UPS (under-the-screen sensor tech), HoD (touch-sensitive tech), and SoD (""screen sound tech""). Since the FoD and SoD tech already exist on the market and HoD tech isn't exactly novel, the key innovation here is that UPS tech. That right there is what will bring us a notchless AND bezel-less screen that is, basically, the display of our dreams that has been just out of reach of today's tech.  Needless to say, this would be a breakthrough for the smartphone market. There's no word yet on the public release of such an innovation or the launch of the long-awaited folding Galaxy F. Perhaps, both will be arriving soon, maybe even together. Is this the end of smartphone displays as we know it? As Samsung said themselves.",TECHNOLOGY,Real

Apple iPhone XR Review: The Colourful iPhone That Sets up Many Questions ,"Let us start with a thought that you might want to chew on for a bit—how important is the display panel type, when you are considering buying a phone? As in, are your eyes perfectly tuned to figure out the difference between an LCD and an OLED screen, or maybe even the fine differences between different types of OLED screens? If your answer is on the lines of “yes, very important”, then you can safely move on to reading another article on this website. However, if you are leaning towards “not too important as long as it gets the job done”, you might want to stick around for a bit longer.   What we have on the agenda today is the new Apple iPhone XR. This is the return of the colourful iPhones after many years (yes, the iPhone 5c was a long time ago). This was also expected to be the truly affordable iPhone this year, which would in many ways run a calming hand over the fevered brow of those who otherwise find the iPhones too expensive. The complication however is that unlike the iPhone X last year, and the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max this year and so on, you simply knew you were getting an upgrade—across all considerations you may have. With the iPhone XR, it isn’t that simple. This is an iPhone that makes you wait, and look at it, and deliberate—and that is not just because of its beautiful colour options.   The first thing you need to consider is the price. The iPhone XR is priced at Rs76,900 (64GB), Rs81,900 (128GB) and Rs91,900 (256GB). This is what many expected, correctly or wrongly, would be an “affordable” iPhone. The price at which the iPhone XR lands in India does have to factor in the fairly volatile currency at the moment, as well as local taxes and what not, which means it isn’t what many hoped it would be.   The exciting colours that the iPhone XR is available in, make it tough to choose a favorite. There is the sophisticated blue, a subtle white, a comfortable black, a chirpy yellow, a cheerful coral and the gorgeous (PRODUCT)Red to choose from. The colours will make this iPhone stand out in a crowd from other iPhones, and any other phone for that matter. The design language is the same as the iPhone XS, which means it is up to date on the design front.   Apple iPhone XR-2  The iPhone XR doesn’t compromise on the build quality, and instead, the combination of glass and metal that you will hold in your hand clearly has the same Apple-esque precision that we have come to expect. The attention to detail is best explained by the fact that the inside of the Lightning port on the phone also adorns the colour of the iPhone XR. The slight shine that the glass layer adds to the back, makes colours such as Coral sparkle very nicely. Incidentally, the glass used on the iPhone XR certainly doesn’t catch as many fingerprints as last year’s iPhone X. Apple doesn't exactly say who makes the glass, but the changes this time around have worked well. That said, the moment you pick up the iPhone XR, it feels a tad heavier than you expect. Some of it has to do with the display technology, some of it has to do with the materials being used—but the extra weight is noticeable initially. To put numbers in perspective, it is 17 grams heavier than the iPhone XS and 16 grams lighter than the larger iPhone XS Max.  Apple has downgraded the water and dust resistance rating on the iPhone XR. It is IP 67, as compared to IP 68 on the iPhone XS and XS Max to IP 67. This means that the iPhone XR will be able to take a dip in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes and come away unscathed, as against 2 meters of water for 30 minutes which the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max can survive.  It is hard to miss the thicker black bezel running around the display notice that the bezel around the screen is ever so slightly thicker than the iPhone XS devices, but a lot of that also has to do with the LCD display backlighting as compared with the OLED screens. Apple calls the iPhone XR’s LCD display as Liquid Retina. It would perhaps be unfair to compare this with an OLED screen on the iPhone XS. Yes, while this has a lower pixel density and resolution than the OLED iPhones, it is still touching 326 pixels per inch. This is the same as all iPhones apart from the iPhone X, the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max. Anyone upgrading from any other iPhone apart from these three, should not notice any difference at all as they use the iPhone XR for the regular daily usage. As far as the brightness, colour vibrancy and sharpness are concerned, this Liquid Retina display does the job. It is rich to look at, text looks great, photo editing is immersive and there are very minimal reflections only. However, look at the display at an angle, and the colour shift is quite perceptible, something that wasn't the case with earlier LCD displays on previous generation iPhones.   Incidentally, this Liquid Retina display does not support 3D Touch—could this be the first indication of the beginning of the end for this feature? Hard to say, but the iPhone XR could be indicating the future.   It is quite positive that the iPhone XR isn’t compromising at all in terms of the power. It shares the same innards as the more expensive iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. The powerful Apple A12 Bionic, which is the first 7-nanometer chip in a smartphone, is the heart and soul of the iPhone XR too. That means it'll have the same level of computing prowess when it comes to the artificial intelligence algorithms—including for Portrait photos, AR apps and Animojis. The iPhone XR also has the same TrueDepth Module too.  Apple iPhone XR-4  The sameness ends when we flip the iPhone XR around—the rear camera. The single 12-megapixel camera with the f/1.8 aperture and Smart HDR. It has the same image processing algorithms as the iPhone XS, which means most photos should retain the same brilliance and level of detailing. However, the big change is this is one single optical hardware, instead of the dual cameras that the other two iPhones have. Smart HDR is a great tool to have, and the way Apple have optimized it, we notice that it retains much more detail in the shadows for instance, while the rest of the frame doesn’t get blown out. There is no secondary telephoto lens, and you’ll probably miss it of you are used to taking a lot of photos on zoom—for someone who has been spoilt with the 2x optical zoom on the iPhone X and beyond, this takes some getting used to.   The bigger limitations are experienced with the portrait mode. While the iPhone XS and XS Max combine the data captured by the wide-angle lens and the telephoto lens, the iPhone XR’s rear-camera Portrait Mode relies heavily on software. As things are, this only works if it can detect a human face in the frame. No, it won’t get conned by pets or soft toys or statues or bobbleheads (at least in our experience). If you want to take a portrait photo of an object or a thing, that won’t happen. The camera app will tell you “No person detected”. While the iPhones with dual cameras have five Portrait photography and editing modes, the iPhone XR has only three. Which means, from Natural Light, Studio Light, Contour Light, Stage Light, and Stage Light Mono, the iPhone XR eliminates Stage Light and Stage Light Mono, since there is no secondary optical hardware to provide additional photography data for these to work. However, you do get complete depth control which can be edited using the slider—the same as the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. There are times when the software struggles a bit to do consistent mapping of the subject and edge detection struggles a bit.   Whether you buy the iPhone XR or not does not depend on the display or whether this offers a performance compromise. Instead, it will totally hinge on whether you need the secondary rear camera for portrait and zoom photos. If you are okay with the limited Portrait mode, and really like the Yellow, Blue, (PRODUCT)Red or Coral colours, the iPhone XR is absolutely worth the experience. But there is still the iPhone X to consider. And whether you really see value in an iPhone XR over even last year’s iPhone X (dual camera and very powerful A11 Bionic chip). To say that the iPhone X is still an excellent iPhone is surely a massive understatement.  ",TECHNOLOGY,Real

Facebook Rolling Out Biggest Messenger Design Update For Its 1.3 Billion Users ,"The social network began rolling out a redesigned version featuring three tabs instead of nine, saying it was ""going back to its roots"" seven years after the standalone app's launch. ""We build one feature after another; they're piling up,"" Messenger chief Stan Chudnovsky said of the service, which has grown from a simple messaging app to one that lets users make video calls, send money and more.  The updated tabs allow users to navigate between their conversations under ""Chats,"" stories and contacts at ""People,"" and ""Discovery,"" which is devoted to games and exchanges with businesses. Facebook has positioned Messenger as a tool for businesses to efficiently handle customer questions or concerns. Talking to customers via the app is free -- but businesses can also pay for Facebook ads that let customers start a conversation or visit their page with one click.  Messenger is part of Facebook's effort to expand outside the social network -- particularly when it comes to staying relevant to mobile lifestyles and younger people, who have been moving away from the service.

"Amazon.com, Qualcomm to Put Alexa Assistant in More Headphones ","Microchip firm Qualcomm Inc is joining Amazon.com Inc to spread the use of Amazon's Alexa voice assistant in wireless headphones, the companies said on Monday. Under the deal, Qualcomm will release a set of chips that any maker of Bluetooth headphones can use to embed Alexa directly into the device. When the headphones are paired to a phone with the Alexa app on it, users will be able to talk to the voice assistant by tapping a button on the headphones.  The functionality would be similar to Apple Inc's AirPods wireless earbuds, which enable users can tap the devices to talk to Apple's virtual assistant, Siri. Amazon and Alphabet Inc's Google, whose voice assistants have most often been found in their respective smart speakers for the home, are rushing to partner with headphone makers.  Models from Bose Corp and Jabra feature Alexa built in, and Sony Corp said earlier this year that a software update will make some of its headphone models work with Alexa. Google Assistant can be used on headphones from Bose, JBL and Sony, along with Google's own Pixel Buds. The Qualcomm partnership could expand that lineup. Qualcomm has developed a pre-made circuit that headphone makers can drop into their device to imbue it with Alexa.  ""This radically reduces their [engineering] cost and time to market,"" Anthony Murray, senior vice president and general manager of voice and music for Qualcomm, told Reuters in an interview. ""It makes it simple for the industry to adopt this."" Murray declined to comment on whether Qualcomm would make a similar offering for Google Assistant but said the chip firm plans to support other partners in the future.  The move is part of a broader push by Qualcomm to diversify away from its dependence on processor and modem chips for mobile phones. That business proved lucrative for Qualcomm, but its patent licensing model drew regulatory fines and lawsuits from customers such as Apple Inc. At a conference in Hong Kong slated for early Tuesday local time, Qualcomm also said it is working with action camera maker GoPro Inc to put more Qualcomm chips for image processing in the devices. The firm has said it expects about $5 billion in revenue from non-mobile sources this year, or more than 20 percent of the $22.4 billion in sales that analysts expect. ",TECHNOLOGY,Real

Appliance Manufacturer Dyson to Make Electric Cars in Singapore ,"British electric appliance pioneer Dyson said it had picked Singapore as the site for its first electric car plant as part of a £2.5 billion (2.8 billion euro, $3.3 billion) global investment drive in new technology. Dyson, founded and owned by Brexit-backing billionaire entrepreneur James Dyson, said the factory was scheduled for completion in 2020. The company, best known for its cordless vacuum cleaners, hand dryers and fans, is aiming to launch electric vehicles in 2021.  ""The decision of where to make our car is complex, based on supply chains, access to markets and the availability of the expertise that will help us achieve our ambitions,"" Dyson chief executive Jim Rowan said in a statement.  ""Our existing footprint and team in Singapore, combined with the nation's significant advanced manufacturing expertise, made it a frontrunner. Singapore also offers access to high-growth markets as well as an extensive supply chain and a highly-skilled workforce,"" he said.  ""Singapore has a comparatively high-cost base, but also great technology expertise and focus. It is therefore the right place to make high-quality technology loaded machines, and the right place to make our electric vehicle.""  Dyson announced his decision to launch electric cars last year -- a sector in which the company will face stiff competition from established players. Electric vehicles are increasing in popularity as governments worldwide drive forward plans to gradually phase out polluting petrol and diesel cars.  Dyson told AFP in an interview earlier this year that electric cars were already available to order and the manufacturing location would be either in Britain or Asia. The company said that 2017 operating profit surged by almost one third to around £800 million, aided by fast growth in China, India, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Revenues leapt 40 percent to £3.5 billion.",TECHNOLOGY,Real
Pixelgate? Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL Reliability Issues Just Don’t Seem to Stop ,"The Google Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL cannot seem to catch a break. As it turns out, Google’s latest smartphones have some serious reliability issues.   One of the problems being reported is the familiar speaker buzzing. A lot of early adopters are taking to social media platforms including Twitter to suggest that the bottom speaker on the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL phones is producing a random buzzing noise, mostly being reported by users to be audible at mid-range frequencies being played back at low volumes. It is not immediately clear whether the louder audio drowns out the sound or eliminates it altogether, as you push up the volume. “The speaker lightly buzzes from 500-2500Hz, and buzzes very loudly at 20-500Hz. Higher volumes can drown out the buzz but it's still audible, whereas lower volumes can make things almost unlistenable. Just typing on Gboard and tapping through the UI creates a very noticeable buzz,” reports a user qtpa2tnh on Reddit, and he owns a Pixel 3 XL.   This is the second issue to befall the speakers on Google’s newest phones. Earlier, it was reported that the two speakers on the new Pixel phones don’t have the same audio output levels. Though Google did take to Reddit to clarify that this is by design, it hasn’t assuaged the fears. “Hi all, This is by design. We specially designed speakers that allow for louder sound (40% louder than last year) and better low frequency response. We use new amplifier technology with advanced speaker protection algorithms to push these speakers harder and really get every last bit of performance out of them. We also worked closely with the expert tuning of a Grammy-award winning music producer to enhance the audio in a way that plays to the strengths of the hardware system.” However, users are not convinced. “I initially thought the top speaker was busted...but no it's just noticeably quieter than the bottom one,” said a user with the handle rayw_reddit. “Pixel 3 XL owner here. I can confirm the imbalance is real. The bottom speaker is much louder and better with bass, and the top is definitely softer and slightly better with treble. It doesn't bother me much if I tell myself Google did that intentionally, but why call them ""stereo?” asks another user mcnick0495.   And it isn’t just the buzzing speakers which are the problem for the new Pixel phones.   A lot of users are reporting an issue with memory management on the new Pixel phones. Apparently, the background process for certain apps that are being used at the time get stopped if the user switches to another app temporarily—this could be quite nasty with music or video streaming apps, for instance. This could be an issue with very aggressive process killing, or the fact that the phone isn’t holding more than a couple of apps temporarily in the RAM at any given point of time. That said, Google’s decision to have 4GB of RAM in the new Pixel phones is surely not the reason for this, but something more on the lines of poorly optimized task management.   The final trouble that users are reporting with the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL phones is that sometimes they do not save photos that you may have clicked using the default camera app. This is despite the fact that a little preview appears at the bottom of the screen once you tap the shutter button suggesting the photo has been saved, when it actually doesn’t show up in the list of photos later. It is not immediately known if this is a camera bug or an issue with how the Photos app integrates with the camera on the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL.   This is a bit unfortunate, considering how the Pixel 2 XL phones from last year also struggled with certain issues, such as speaker buzzing and a very muted display. The magnitude of any potential hardware or software problems just gets expanded, since the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL are largely running the same hardware, except the differing display sizes for instance, which wasn’t exactly the case in the past year.

Teens And Europe Are Giving up on Facebook  But Instagram is The Surprise Gainer ,"The tough year for Facebook shows no signs of abating. There really is no getting around the fact that people are leaving Facebook, perhaps as a fallout of all the scandals which have dented consumer confidence significantly. Teens are giving up on Facebook, those above the age of 50 simply don’t understand how it works and Europe is set to give Facebook even more headaches.   According to estimates by financial services firm Morgan Stanley, Facebook’s user base in Europe may have stumbled by as much as 1 million, owing to the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which kicked in over the summer. This would be a direct result of Facebook requiring hundreds of millions of European users to either opt in to having data collected, as per the new GDPR rules, or stop using the site.   However, in the midst of Facebook’s turmoil, its sister app Instagram is the big gainer. The latest numbers shared by investment banking and asset management firm Piper Jaffray suggest that Facebook’s sister social network, Instagram, has seen a spike in popularity. And it is also hurting its biggest rival, Snapchat, along the way.   The Piper Jaffray Taking Stock With Teens Survey numbers suggest that 85 percent of teens use Instagram at least once per month, compared with 84 percent for Snapchat. The Instagram numbers are up from 81 percent same time last year, though Snapchat has also seen an increase from 82 percent in the same period of 2017.   Last month, numbers released by Pew Research suggested that a whopping 44 percent of those ages 18 to 29 in the US suggest that they have deleted the Facebook app from their phone in the past one year—Pew has surveyed 3,400 Facebook users in May and June this year. Surely, the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which became public knowledge earlier this year, would have been fresh in the minds of Facebook users.   However, it is a bit more complicated than that. The research also suggested that 26 percent of the survey respondents confirmed to having deleted the Facebook app, 42 percent said that they were temporarily “taking a break” from the social media platform and 54 percent have adjusted their privacy settings.  There is another big challenge for Facebook—a lot of its users simply don’t understand how the News Feed works. Pew Research, 53 percent of US adults who use Facebook do not understand how the News Feed works, how the content that they see is chosen to be there and why some content is given priority over other posts. The same research suggests that only 38 percent of respondents above the age of 50 understand the dynamics of the Facebook News Feed. ""They don’t feel like they have a lot of agency or control over the content that they are getting, and many of them have not actively attempted to change or shift that content. That’s particularly true for older users,"" said Aaron Smith, Pew's associate director of research on internet and technology issues, in an official statement. ",TECHNOLOGY,Real
Google to Charge Android Partners up to $40 Per Device For Apps ,"Alphabet Inc's Google will charge hardware firms up to $40 per device to use its apps under a new licensing system to replace one that the European Union this year deemed anti-competitive, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. The new fee goes into effect on Oct. 29 for any new smartphone or tablet models launched in the European Economic Area and running Google's Android operating system, the company announced on Tuesday.  The fee can be as low as $2.50 and rises depending on the country and device size, the person said. It is standard across manufacturers, with the majority likely to pay around $20, the person added. Companies can offset the charge, which applies to a suite of apps including the Google Play app store, Gmail and Google Maps, by placing Google's search and Chrome internet browser in a prominent position. Under that arrangement, Google would give the device maker a portion of ad revenue it generates through search and Chrome.  Tech news outlet the Verge reported the pricing earlier on Friday, citing confidential documents. The European Commission in July found Google abused its market dominance in mobile software to essentially force Android partners to pre-install search and Chrome on their gadgets. It levied a record $5-billion fine, which Google has appealed, and threatened additional penalties unless the company ended its illegal practices.  The new system should give Google's rivals such as Microsoft Corp more room to partner with hardware makers to become the default apps for search and browsing, analysts said. Qwant, a small French search company that has been critical of Google, said in a statement on Friday that it was ""satisfied that the European Commission's action pushed Google to finally give manufacturers the possibility to offer such choices to consumers.""",TECHNOLOGY,Real
"NASA Names New Gamma-Ray Constellations After Godzilla, Hulk ","NASA has used certain characters from modern myths such as the ""Hulk"" and ""Godzilla"" to name its new set of 21 gamma-ray constellations constructed in celebration of its Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope's 10th year of operations. Fermi has mapped about 3,000 gamma-ray sources -- 10 times the number known before its launch and comparable to the number of bright stars in the traditional constellations.  ""For the first time ever, the number of known gamma-ray sources was comparable to the number of bright stars, so we thought a new set of constellations was a great way to illustrate the point,"" NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center's Elizabeth Ferrara who led the constellation project said in a statement. ""Developing these unofficial constellations was a fun way to highlight a decade of Fermi's accomplishments,"" Julie McEnery, the Fermi project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said.   Comic book fans who know the backstory of Hulk, the big, green, angry alter ego of Bruce Banner, whose experiments with gamma rays went terribly wrong, could easily appreciate NASA's pick in naming one of its constellations. Gamma rays are the strongest form of light. They pack enough punch to convert into matter under the right circumstances, a transformation both Banner and the Hulk would certainly appreciate.  NASA's choice of Godzilla constellation is linked to its trademark weapon ""heat ray,"" a fiery jet. This bears at least a passing resemblance to gamma-ray jets associated with black holes and neutron stars. Godzilla ranks as one of cinema's most famous monsters and is among the most recognisable symbols of Japanese popular culture.   In the original 1954 movie, nuclear weapons tests disturb the creature's deep ocean habitat, and it emerges from the sea to wreak havoc in Japan. The 21 gamma-ray constellations also include famous landmarks -- such as Sweden's recovered warship, Vasa, the Washington Monument and Mount Fuji in Japan -- in countries contributing to Fermi science.   Since 2008, Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT) has been scanning the entire sky each day, mapping and measuring sources of gamma rays, the highest-energy light in the universe. The emission may come from pulsars, nova outbursts, the debris of supernova explosions and giant gamma-ray bubbles located in our own galaxy, or supermassive black holes and gamma-ray bursts -- the most powerful explosions in the cosmos -- in others.   ""Fermi is still going strong, and we are now preparing a new all-sky LAT catalog,"" said Jean Ballet, a Fermi team member at the French Atomic Energy Commission in Saclay. ""This will add about 2,000 sources, many varying greatly in brightness, further enriching these constellations and enlivening the high-energy sky!""",TECHNOLOGY,Real

WhatsApp Flooded With Fake News Ahead of Brazil Election ,"Facebook Inc's popular messaging service WhatsApp has become a political battleground in Brazil's most polarized election in decades, raising concerns that it is distorting debate beyond the public eye. Facebook has touted efforts to crack down on misinformation on its main platform ahead of the Oct. 28 presidential run-off between right-winger Jair Bolsonaro and leftist Fernando Haddad. But WhatsApp has been flooded with falsehoods and conspiracy theories. Haddad now alleges that businessmen supporting Bolsonaro have been paying to bombard voters with misleading propaganda in violation of electoral law, which his rival denies.  HOW INFLUENTIAL IS WHATSAPP?  WhatsApp has more than 120 million users in Brazil, a country of nearly 210 million, rivaling the reach of Facebook's main platform in one of the company's biggest global markets. The messaging service has become one of the main ways Brazilians keep in touch with friends, colleagues and family. The election's first-round vote on Oct. 7 underscored the major role that social media now plays in Brazilian politics.  Bolsonaro, a seven-term congressman from a tiny party, had little access to public campaign funding or TV advertising but his grassroots campaign and outsized presence on social media helped him win 46 percent of votes, nearly foregoing a run-off. Polling firm Datafolha found that two-thirds of Brazilian voters use WhatsApp. Bolsonaro supporters were more likely to follow political news on the platform with 61 percent saying they did so, compared to 38 percent of Haddad voters.  WHAT ARE THE RISKS?  WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption allows groups of hundreds of users to exchange texts, photos and video beyond the purview of electoral authorities, independent fact checkers or even the platform itself. False rumors, manipulated photos, decontextualized videos and audio hoaxes have become campaign ammunition, going viral on the platform with no way to monitor their origin or full reach.  Many of the fakes portray Haddad as a communist whose Workers Party would turn Brazil into another Cuba, convert children to homosexuality and plans to rig voting machines. Others have spread a conspiracy theory that Bolsonaro had staged his near-fatal stabbing at a rally last month, which took him off the campaign trail and out of presidential debates. WhatsApp has tried to discourage the tsunami of falsehoods by limiting how many recipients a message can be forwarded to. The company also has run public advertising on how to spot fake news and blocked hundreds of thousands of accounts during the campaign, with technology spotting automated ""bot"" behavior.  WHAT IS THE LATEST SCANDAL?  Haddad accuses Bolsonaro of not just benefiting from misinformation on WhatsApp but encouraging supporters to fund bulk messaging over the platform. That would amount to soliciting illegal campaign contributions in what they call an ""abuse of economic power"" undermining the election. On Thursday, newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported Bolsonaro supporters had paid digital marketing firms up to 12 million reais ($3.26 million) each to spread tens of thousands of attack ads. Haddad said his party had witnesses who heard Bolsonaro encouraging business leaders to fund the efforts.  Bolsonaro has denied any knowledge of such a scheme and called on any supporters doing so to stop. WhatsApp said it takes the allegations seriously and is ""taking immediate legal action to stop companies from sending bulk messages,"" including cease-and-desist letters to the companies in question.  WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES?  Brazil's chief electoral court on Friday opened an investigation into the allegations, which pundits quickly labeled ""WhatsAppgate."" Haddad's allies argue that the scandal should invalidate the election. However, the investigation is unlikely to derail Bolsonaro's campaign with just a week to go before the vote and an 18 percentage point lead over Haddad in recent opinion polls.  Still, the allegations have tensed up an already angry and polarized electorate and are likely to hang over the next government. The way marketing companies obtained cellphone numbers used for WhatsApp messaging may have violated Brazil's data privacy laws, according to Fabio Malini, a professor of technology at Espirito Santo federal university.  Brazilian lawmakers and judges have tried repeatedly in recent years to encroach on the privacy offered by WhatsApp, creating headaches for Facebook executives who are often called to account. The latest electoral scandal could intensify those pressures.",TECHNOLOGY,Real

Apple CEO Tim Cook Urges Bloomberg to Retract Spy Chip Story ,"Apple CEO Tim Cook is urging Bloomberg to retract its story about an alleged embedded Chinese spying chips that compromised about 30 companies including the servers of Apple. BuzzFeed News said Friday that the Apple CEO, who received an interview with the news outlet on Thursday, went on the record for the first time to deny allegations that his company was the victim of a hardware-based attack from a Chinese supplier and demanded Bloomberg retract the unfounded story, reports Xinhua news agency.  ""There is no truth in their story about Apple,"" Cook told BuzzFeed News. ""They need to do that right thing and retract it."" Bloomberg Businessweek issued a story earlier this month alleging about 30 US companies were compromised after their servers were implanted malicious chips during their manufacture in China, which created ""a stealth backdoor"" into their network running on the servers. Apple denied in an October 4 statement that it had found the ""malicious chips"" in servers on its network, saying it refuted ""virtually every aspect of Bloomberg' s story relating to Apple"".  ""Apple has never found malicious chips, hardware manipulations or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server,"" it said. In the latest response to the Bloomberg claims, Cook said he ""was involved in our response to this story from the beginning"". ""I personally talked to the Bloomberg reporters along with Bruce Sewell, who was then our general counsel. We were very clear with them that this did not happen, and answered all their questions,"" said Cook.   ""Each time they brought this up to us, the story changed, and each time we investigated we found nothing,"" he added. ""We turned the company upside down... We really forensically whipped through the company to dig very deep and each time we came back to the same conclusion: this did not happen. There's no truth to this,"" Cook said. The Bloomberg's report has been extensively questioned even by representatives of the companies it claimed to fall victim to the ""backdoor"" attack.  Earlier this month, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee to ""be careful what you read"" in reference to the report, BuzzFeed News said. It quoted a high-ranking executive of a tech giant in Silicon Valley as saying that his company has conducted investigations, which didn' t turn up any evidence of tampering.

Uber Integrates Data Calling Into App ,"For many countries across the world, it's cheaper to make calls over the internet than cellularly; if you're an international traveler, data calling is often the only option. It's no wonder a global transportation service like Uber would want to join the VoIP (or voice of internet protocol) movement. In fact, the ride-hailing service has been working on the feature since June, but just this week it became available, according to The Verge.  Uber has long provided users with an internet-based in-app chat function, as well as the options to send SMS text messages and make phone calls through a telephone network. Unfortunately, users were finding themselves in situations where the in-app chat wasn't enough to adequately connect them to a driver when a cellular network wasn't available. Now, whether a message needs to be sent or a call made, the entire service can take place online via the app.  Streamlined communication is essential for transportation services, and the VoIP option is a trending feature that both connects people and saves them money. As Gagan Mac, project manager for communications at Uber noted, ""smooth pickups hinge on seamless communication between riders and drivers,"" and such an addition puts the company just a step ahead of other popular ride-hailing services like Lyft or Easy Taxi.",TECHNOLOGY,Real
Hackers Breach Govt Health Insurance System in US ,"Hackers have got access to personal data belonging to 75,000 people in a breach of government health insurance system used by insurance agents and brokers to help customers sign up for healthcare plans in the US, the media reported. The hacked system was connected to the Healthcare.gov website, where the general public can sign up for healthcare coverage, TechCrunch reported on Saturday.   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), part of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), confirmed the breach late on Friday. ""We are working to identify the individuals potentially impacted as quickly as possible so that we can notify them and provide resources such as credit protection,"" CMS Administrator Seema Verma said in a statement.  CMS staff detected anomalous activity in the Federally Facilitated Exchanges, or FFE's Direct Enrollment pathway for agents and brokers on October 13. Verma noted that this system is different from the consumer-facing Healthcare.gov website, The Verge reported.

Juventus too Good for Manchester United on Ronaldo's Return ,"Cristiano Ronaldo emerged victorious again on his second return to Old Trafford, but this time did not get on the scoresheet as Juventus outclassed Manchester United to win 1-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday.  Instead, Ronaldo played a supporting role by helping set up Paulo Dybala's winner on 17 minutes as the Italian champions opened up a five-point lead over United at the top of Group H.  Jose Mourinho's men were handed a break before kick-off as Valencia's 1-1 draw away to Young Boys means United still hold a two-point lead over the Spaniards, but a fourth defeat of the season will see speculation over Mourinho's future increase once more.  But for a series of excellent saves from David de Gea, the margin of defeat could have been far greater too as any momentum United gained from fightbacks against Newcastle and Chelsea in recent weeks in the Premier League faded away against one of the favourites to win the Champions League.  Ronaldo was given a hero's welcome on his previous visit to Old Trafford with Real Madrid in 2013 after scoring 118 goals for United in six seasons between 2003 and 2009 to help the Red Devils win three Premier League titles and the first of his five Champions Leagues.  The Portuguese's early days as Juventus player since making the move to Italy from Madrid this summer have been overshadowed by a rape allegation made against him in the United States.  The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has strongly denied the allegation and been backed by his new club, who paid 112 million euros ($129 million) for the 33-year-old in July.  But the reception he received from the United faithful this time was far more muted with only a mild cheer raised when his name in the Juventus line-up was announced.  Ronaldo scored the winner in a contentious Champions League last-16 tie for Madrid five years ago, but this time played the role of provider for Dybala to be the match-winner.  His cross intended for Juan Cuadrado ricocheted kindly off Chris Smalling into the path of Dybala to sweep the ball past De Gea for his fourth goal in two Champions League games.  As Juventus dominated the rest of the first half, only De Gea stood in their way of killing the game off before the break.  The Spaniard flew to his right to save Joao Cancelo's fiercely-struck shot then produced a fine double save to parry Ronaldo's free-kick and swat away Blaise Matuidi's follow-up effort.  Top scorer in this competition for the past six seasons, Ronaldo is still searching for his first Champions League goal for Juventus having been sent off after just 30 minutes of his European debut against Valencia and subsequently banned for a 3-0 victory over Young Boys.  He couldn't have done much more with an effort that soared towards De Gea's top corner seven minutes into the second half only to see the United 'keeper produce a miraculous right-handed save.  Going behind brought out the best in Mourinho's side against Newcastle and Chelsea to help ease the pressure on the manager.  But the hosts failed to threaten until Paul Pogba's curling shot from outside the box hit the post 15 minutes from time.  Anthony Martial also tested Wojciech Szczesny late on but Juventus held out for a deserved victory.",SPORTS,Real
"AIFF Intent on Restructuring Indian Football, But Road Ahead Remains Unclear ","Ahead of the 2017/18 edition of the I-League, the biggest talking point among fans and experts alike was the fact that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) had decided to keep the Indian football team that featured in the FIFA U-17 World Cup together as the ‘Indian Arrows’ in a bid to further develop the burgeoning talents.   Yet perhaps the biggest elephant in the room – the fact that the I-League and the Indian Super League (ISL) would be running simultaneously for the first time ahead of a major restructure of the domestic football system – was not addressed at the time.   One year later and with the potential threat of an Asian ban looming should they fail to unify the two leagues by the 2019/20 season, the AIFF unsurprisingly chose to address the issue head on.   “Let us look at the bigger picture. We are talking about restructuring the league and we have a holistic plan for that where we are going to take all the leagues into account and make a better league structure so that India can perform better internationally,” AIFF senior vice-president Subrata Dutta said at the I-League launch in New Delhi on Tuesday.   Yet while it was refreshing to hear that the AIFF were finally looking to merge the two domestic leagues, there are a number of issues that must be addressed before the huge decision is finally taken.   Earlier this year, news broke of a FIFA-backed report that suggested an Asian ban for Indian clubs should they fail to come up with a unified league by the next season.   The report was refuted by AIFF general secretary Kushal Das, who stated that he was yet to receive any report from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and that a decision will be taken in due course.   Complicated Roadmap   However, coming up with a new system will be complicated to say the least considering the fact that an arrangement currently exists that sees the ISL clubs get a 10-year immunity from relegation from 2014 onwards.   Even though the FIFA report called for a review of that and some other arrangements, there is every possibility that it could be upheld even after it is evaluated by the necessary authorities.   This would mean that ISL clubs will not be relegated from 2019-23 while I-League clubs will be both promoted and relegated as the report stated that the new league must become a 16-team tournament by 2023.   More tellingly, this arrangement will see the majority of the I-League clubs – which include legacy sides like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan among others – excluded from the new merged league, at least in the initial stages.   For his part, Dutta stated that it would be unwise to view the leagues individually as the plan was to eventually freshen up the whole domestic league system in India.   “We should not analyse just one league. We should include ISL, we should include I-League and we should include age-group leagues as well as think about the second division league since they all add value to football in our country,” Dutta said.   Yet to not view the ISL and I-League as separate entities given the differing natures of both tournaments is something of an exercise in futility.   One league has been in existence for only five years and has massive financial backing whereas the other began in 1996 as the National Football League and features some of India’s most successful clubs yet has never had the kind of exposure the new league did.   There’s also the fact that I-League clubs tend to enjoy better in-stadium attendance, something the ISL has struggled with especially after the league began to run for longer than two months.   Including the ISL clubs in the revamped league structure makes sense given the amount of money that has been invested in them, yet a truly holistic approach will be needed if the benefits of the reforms are to be enjoyed by all Indian clubs.

I-League: Debutants Real Kashmir Hoping Home Comforts Help in Making it Another Year to Remember ,"New Delhi: For a state like Jammu and Kashmir that has been battling to survive the onslaught that results from a fractious relationship between India and Pakistan, the emergence of Real Kashmir FC in Srinagar has not only brought top flight football to the state for the first time but also is a breath of fresh air.   The club began their journey in 2016 after co-owners Shamim Meraj and Sandeep Chattoo felt it was essential to provide the youth of the state a positive outlet.  “It is a great feeling for us that we are the first team from our state to play in the I-League. Many young boys and girls are playing football nowadays and we feel happy seeing that,” Danish Farooq, the 22-year-old who’s penalty helped the team achieve qualification, said.  Having qualified for the top flight at the expense of Hindustan FC from Delhi in May, the David Robertson-managed side is looking to make a mark in the country’s premier competition, the I-League. The debutants will open their campaign against the defending champions Minerva Punjab (October 31st) in Panchkula, before heading back for a string of home games. Their first home game will be against Goan side Churchill Brothers on November 6th.  Coach Robertson, who has roped in his son Mason into the squad as one of the six foreigners, understands the upcoming season will not be an easy one for his side. The Scot not only has kept his eyes and ears open as he tried to blend talent, experience and youth into his side, but also emphasised that the players coming in needed to be able to keep up the team spirit and camaraderie.  “We begin our journey against the champions (Minerva Punjab) away from home before coming back for six games. That’s where we need to capitalise and get our points, because otherwise suddenly you’ll be in a position of no return and getting demoted will be terrible for the team and the people,” Robertson explains on the sidelines of a promotional event with sportswear giants Adidas. The German company are the kit sponsors for Real Kashmir FC.  “It will definitely be difficult to be one of the title contenders for the season, but I believe with a bit of luck we can finish hopefully in the top half.”  Local Support Can be Our 12th Man  Initially, there was a possibility that Real Kashmir would not be able to play their home games at their favoured Tourist Reception Centre (TRC) ground, but after multiple inspections following the upgradation of facilities, the stadium will play host to its first I-League game on November 6th.  The team’s coach and players were relieved that they will play their home game in Srinagar and an elated club co-owner Shamim Meraj said, “We have things in place (to host I-League games). The capacity of the ground is 10,000 but we will have to cap it to around 6,000 to ensure everything goes smoothly.”  On the big opening day, security arrangements are expected to be boosted as both club and authorities want things to go through without a hiccup.  “I am expecting to see a very noisey bunch at the ground. I’ve seen how a crowd can motivate players and teams and I hope the local crowd in Srinagar can do the same, be our 12th man,” Robertson, the former Aberdeen and Rangers FC player, said.  However, more than a vibrant crowd what is more likely to fit the home advantage bill for Real Kashmir will be the difficult conditions traveling teams will face in Srinagar.  Club captain Loveday Enyinnaya, a Nigerian professional who has turned out for a whole host of Indian clubs like Malabar United F.C., Royal Wahingdoh F.C., Sporting clube de Goa and Minerva Punjab F.C., believes his side is not under any pressure and that it will be up to the others to play well against them in difficult conditions.  “It will be difficult for teams coming to play against us because of the weather. When I had come here initially, I faced problems with the cold to start with, but now I have adjusted. The others won’t find it easy,” says Loveday with a mischievous grin.",SPORTS,Real

From One Teen Sensation to Another - Shooting Coach Rana Has Success Mantra for Manu Bhaker and Saurabh Chaudhary ,"Back in the early 1990s when India was still struggling to make a mark in the world of sport, a teenage boy from Uttarakhand had become an overnight shooting star. Jaspal Rana won gold in 25m center fire pistol event in the 1994 Asian Games at Hiroshima and gave the medal-starved country something to cheer about.  In him, India could have had a champion, but that never happened for many reasons. But now, a good 20 years later a lot has changed. We have a bunch of youngsters who are not only making a mark in the junior level but winning competitions with record scores in the senior category too. Manu Bhaker, Saurabh Chaudhary, Mehuli Ghosh, Anish Bhanwala are all household names and the man behind their meteoric rise has been none other than the current junior coach – Rana.  Recently after the Asian Games' success, these youngsters bagged a rich haul of medals at the Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires too. Coach Rana, though happy, doesn’t want to get carried away. For him, these kids already belong in the senior category and need to keep winning against the world’s best.  “To win four medals at Youth Olympics, who wouldn't be happy with that. It's unprecedented effort by our shooters. We do not go by the policy that you got to improve in every competition. We have one clear aim in our mind and that is to get results in every tournament. If we don't prepare like that the results would not come,” Rana told News18 Sports after the team returned from Youth Olympics.  “All these shooters are better than the juniors, but they need to keep putting in the hard work for further success. That feeling to constantly win needs to come from within and that’s what will make them successful against world’s best.”  But having seen the downfall of so many budding shooters, Rana wants to be cautious with the new bunch. He has always been vocal about the need to protect and preserve talents like Bhaker and Choudhary and once again stressed the need to keep them away from distractions.  “I have seen some really talented shooters wasted to distractions like money and fame. It's not a very healthy sign. After every victory when everyone's happy for these kids, whereas I get worried for their future. When you see a player go down, it's not a great feeling personally. And in fact this is with the 90-95% of the shooters. Only 3-4 out of a big bunch have it in them to withstand all this.”  “If you see, these kids are getting lakhs and crores from the state governments. But this money can only get you luxury and not medals.”  One would feel that all junior shooters are in safe hands now as Rana must have been at the start of his career. When we posed this question to Rana, prompt came the reply, “It is not about how well-equipped I am to handle these kids but about how well they understand the situation right now. Also there needs to be some control over the money these shooters are given.”  It’s a precarious position to be in. As much as Rana wants youngsters to realise the worth of staying away from the distractions, he understands that he’s dealing with teenagers, or grown up kids. So it’s not advisable to push them beyond their limits.   “If you see, the performance has improved as compared to the previous years. These young kids carry the burden of expectations from everyone, and their own self too. So they need to be mentally very stable. But it is not possible all the time. Just for instance I was at the shooting range today, and I did not see Manu and Saurabh there. They must have been tired from the flight and felicitation programs. Now Asian leg is on our head and you ought to be training every day. To get results, you have to forget all these factors and be back on your feet.”   A thorough taskmaster that Rana sounds, he finally appreciates his wards and has his hopes pinned on the Asian Championships next year, that will have maximum number of quotas for Tokyo 2020.  “Shooting is perhaps one sport, even if you get results with one method on one occasion, you might fail the next time. So you have to be on top of your game all the time. But then at the end of the day you can just look back at the effort put in and be happy with the work done by the shooters.”  “We hope to get as much quota places as we can for the Olympics in Asian Championships. That is the big goal right now, and I have faith in these shooters to do well,” he signed off.",SPORTS,Real
Lopetegui Confident of Being in Charge Against Barcelona ,"Julen Lopetegui has said he is ""absolutely convinced"" he will still be Real Madrid's coach for the Clasico against Barcelona in La Liga on Sunday.  Madrid hung on for a 2-1 win over Viktoria Plzen on Tuesday as goals from Karim Benzema and Marcelo secured a much-needed, albeit unconvincing, victory.  Lopetegui said he hoped the result would prove a ""turning point"" for his team, who had lost three games on the bounce.  The result puts the European champions level on points with Roma in Group G of the Champions League and offers Lopetegui some respite ahead of this weekend's trip to the Camp Nou.  Asked if he will be in the dug-out against Barca, Lopetegui said after the match: ""I am absolutely convinced of that yes. We won and we are already thinking from tomorrow about preparing for Sunday.""  Real Madrid director Emilio Butragueno also appeared to confirm on Tuesday night that Lopetegui would be in charge against Barcelona.  ""Yes, yes, as normal, absolutely,"" Butragueno said. ""I really believe in this type of game, it is very important to stay calm, be together, trust the players.  ""We live it as normal, it's football and it's true, we hear rumours, but we go with confidence to Camp Nou.""  Madrid's players, including Sergio Ramos, Marcelo and Isco, have been pledging their support to Lopetegui since the loss at home to Levante on Saturday.  Benzema was Madrid's star performer against Plzen and offered his backing afterwards. ""The boss is very good, the players are with him,"" Benzema said.  ""It is important the coach feels the confidence of his players and I have a lot of confidence in him.""  Madrid have struggled for goals in recent weeks but they were a threat going forward against Plzen, who looked on course for a straightforward defeat when Marcelo made it 2-0 early in the second half.  Patrik Hrosovsky, however, pulled a goal back with 12 minutes left and Madrid were left hanging on at the end. The final whistle was accompanied by disgruntled whistles from the home fans.  ""I have not noticed anything special, the fans are sensible and treat us fantastically well,"" Lopetegui said.  ""I would have liked to achieve a more comfortable victory but the most important thing is the three points.""  Marcelo's involvement against Barcelona could be in doubt after he sustained an impact injury late on.  ""He has taken a very heavy blow but it seems that it is a knock and not a muscular issue,"" Lopetegui said. ""I hope he will recover but we have to wait.""",SPORTS,Real
"Rampant Arsenal Face Lisbon Test, Chelsea Sweat on Hazard ","Amid a packed schedule, Arsenal take a 10-match winning streak to Sporting Lisbon as their quest to win the Europa League continues Thursday, when city rivals Chelsea, possibly without the influential Eden Hazard, host BATE Borisov of Belarus.  After sealing an impressive 10th straight victory at home to Leicester in the Premier League on Monday, Unai Emery's outfit are the team to watch in Group E.  Arsenal and Sporting sit on six points apiece after two games, with Azerbaijan's Qarabag and fellow strugglers Vorskla of Ukraine still pointless.  Sporting are fifth in Portugal's top flight, four points off the top with former Manchester United star Nani having scored three goals from seven league outings.  If Arsenal needed more reason to believe in their chances of going all the way, they need not look far. As coach of Sevilla in 2013-2016, Emery led the Spaniards to three consecutive Europa League titles.  ""We are beginning to play with heart,"" Emery said after Monday's come-from-behind 3-1 win, in which Mesut Ozil scored and provided an assist in a man-of-the-match performance.  ""I think we played some sexy football,"" said the 30-year-old German.  Sporting, who won 2-1 away to Loures in the Portuguese Cup with Nani and Bruno Fernandes both on target, should be fresher having played on Saturday.  Arsenal played on Monday and Emery, already set to make changes due to a packed schedule, is set to tinker further after both Nacho Monreal and Sead Kolasinac were ruled out.  ""Yesterday was a very bad day for injuries,"" Emery conceded on Tuesday.  'We Can Go All the Way'  Having won both their opening Group L matches, 2013 champions Chelsea can take a major step to the next round with a home win on Thursday, although they may have to do without Hazard.  The Belgian playmaker says he was kicked so much during Chelsea's 2-2 weekend draw with Manchester United that he will miss the Stamford Bridge game against BATE with a bad back.  ""When I woke up on Monday I was stiff. Even during the second half I couldn't accelerate properly,"" he said.  With Spanish centre-forward Alvaro Morata struggling on just three goals this season, Hazard's absence could rob Chelsea of their main attacking threat after a blistering seven-goal start to the Premier League campaign.  Yet Brazilian winger Willian remains upbeat about their chances, claiming the entire club has been given a lift by the arrival of new coach Maurizio Sarri.  ""The way we are playing this season, we can go all the way,"" the in-form winger said of their Europa League campaign.  As Marseille prepare to face Lazio, the French side will be hoping the past experience of coach Rudi Garcia pays dividends as they bid for their first win of the group stage following a 2-2 draw at Apollon Limassol. He joined them from Roma, where he faced Lazio five times in the capital-city derby and never lost.  ""Three wins and two draws in five games, I hope we can get a result like I used to in those Rome derbies,"" Garcia told AFP.  He added: ""I'll always have a little bit of Roma in my heart so that gives us added inspiration, but what counts here is winning, not punchlines.""

Pro Kabaddi 2018: U Mumba Thrash Telugu Titans 41-20 ,"Pune: Siddharth Desai produced a terrific raiding performance to guide U Mumba to a comfortable 41-20 win over Telugu Titans in the Inter Zone Challenge Week of Vivo Pro Kabaddi League Season VI here Tuesday.  Rahul Chaudhari created history by becoming the first man to score 700 raid points in Pro Kabaddi but couldn't save his team from a defeat.  Desai scored 17 points and made life difficult for the Titans' defence throughout the match. He is also the leading raider of the Pro Kabaddi League Season VI with 83 points so far.  Chaudhari opened Telugu Titans' account with a raid in the first minute.  Desai got two quick raid points as U Mumba led 3-1 after two minutes.  Mohsen Magsudlou got into the act with Chaudhari as Titans scored five straight points to lead 6-3 in the seventh minute.  Desai continued his hot streak as he piled up points and pressure on the Telugu Titans defence.  In the 13th minute, Desai scored a super raid to give U Mumba 13-7 lead as they inflicted the first all out of the match.  Titans' defence found it difficult to contain Desai in the first half.  Chaudhari scored two raid points in two minutes as Titans reduced the deficit to 10-14. At the end of the first half U Mumba led 17-12.  The second half saw Desai at his best again as he scored with a super raid in the 21st minute to give U Mumba 20-12 lead.  U Mumba stepped up their game in the first 10 minutes of the second half and inflicted another all out in the 24th minute to lead 25-16.  A moment of history was created in the second half when Chaudhari scored a raid point to become the first man in PKL to reach the 700-raid point mark.  However, he wasn't able to revive his team's fortunes in the match.  U Mumba inflicted another all out in the 31st minute to open a massive 18-point lead.  In the last five minutes, U Mumba gave a run out to few of their bench players as they were ensured of a comfortable victory.  U Mumba collected a few tackle points in the last couple of minutes of the match to wrap up an easy 41-20 win.

Madrid Hand Lopetegui Respite With Nervy Win Over Plzen ,"It might not be enough to save Julen Lopetegui but Real Madrid's 2-1 Champions League win over Viktoria Plzen on Tuesday stopped the rot and restored some belief.  Barcelona are next at Camp Nou and even without the injured Lionel Messi, Madrid are unlikely to find them as generous if handed the sort of golden chances Plzen were presented with at the Santiago Bernabeu.  But after five games without a win, and three defeats in a row, victory was all-important, and Madrid secured it with a goal in each half from Karim Benzema and Marcelo.  It could have been more comfortable and when Patrik Hrosovsky pulled one back for Plzen with 12 minutes left, a nervy finale ensued. When it was over, there were disgruntled whistles from the home fans.  Lopetegui's side held on, however, to reassert themselves in Group G, where the reigning champions now sit level on six points with Roma.  Whether he is still in charge for the return fixture in the Czech Republic next month remains to be seen.  Florentino Perez may well have already made up his mind to make a change but there is still the question of timing.  Barcelona would be a cruel opening assignment for a new coach while defeat in a Clasico, perhaps a heavy one, could also kill any potential bounce.  Instead, Lopetegui was still on the touchline here, cajoling and clapping as his team created, and missed, more chances. Wincing as Plzen also squandered theirs.  He left all four of the club's summer signings on the bench including Alvaro Odriozola, who was replaced at right-back by Lucas Vazquez. Perhaps it was a coincidence, or perhaps a message to the board.  There was gentle applause when Lopetegui's name was announced before kick-off and Madrid's players started like they were trying for him too.  Sergio Ramos headed over and then against the post when twice allowed to run free but if they were eager up front, they were nervy at the back too.  Keylor Navas jabbed a difficult pass straight out of play and then had to make a save, as Milan Petrzela raced in behind Vazquez and was denied on the angle by Navas' thigh.  After weeks of agonising about scoring, Madrid then made it look easy. Vazquez, more comfortable going forward, chipped a cross to the back post, where the lively Benzema timed his run perfectly and nodded in from a yard.  Benzema and Isco both should have doubled the lead but opted to shoot when a pass would have given a tap-in. Bale and Toni Kroos each threw their arms up in frustration.  Plzen could have punished them as David Limbersky's chip floated wide before Petrzela feathered over from two yards with only Navas to beat. It was a dreadful miss and spared the blushes of Marcelo, who had sold himself on the opposite flank.  The full-back was absent again at the start of the second half when Milan Havel failed to connect with a cross to the back post.  But Marcelo's defensive frailties have always come with an attacking benefit and his chipped finish in the 55th minute gave Madrid the breathing space they craved. Bale's deft touch had sent him clear in the box.  Bale was freed by Benzema but his finish was blocked and Luka Modric's scooped through ball suggested Madrid were even enjoying themselves, as Bale joined Isco in being substituted.  Plzen, however, had other ideas and after Hrosovsky was allowed to ghost through Madrid's midfield, he curved the ball expertly past Navas' left hand and into the bottom corner.  Plzen smelt a point. Nacho had to hook the ball away from Michael Krmencik in the box as Madrid grew frantic. The visiting fans were cheering louder after full-time.",SPORTS,Real
"India Fail to Break Malaysia's Citadel, Settle for Goalless Draw ","Muscat: Defending champions India missed chances galore to be held to a goalless draw by old nemesis Malaysia in their penultimate round-robin match but they still managed to progress to the semi-finals of the Asian Champions Trophy on Tuesday.

Champions League 'Dream' Awaits Monaco Coach Thierry Henry ,"Newly-appointed Monaco coach Thierry Henry has no intention of sulking over the Ligue 1 side's poor domestic form as he seeks a ""dream"" Champions League date with Club Brugge on Wednesday.  Former Arsenal and France star Henry kicked off his fledgling coaching career with a 2-1 away defeat to Strasbourg at the weekend, a result that left the struggling Principality side second from bottom of the French league table.  Monaco fans will be hoping it won't be more of the same on Wednesday, when they face the Belgians away looking to claim their first points of the group stages.  Henry, a Champions League winner with Barcelona in 2009, believes it could be just the tonic to get Monaco, beaten finalists in 2004, back on track.  ""People might ask if this match is coming at the right time for me, given our position in the table,"" Henry said in Bruges on Tuesday.  ""But they say the same about the teams leading the table, they say the Champions League can't be won by teams fighting for the (domestic) title.  ""I don't see it like that. The Champions League is a dream. You want to play in it, you want to be part of it and it might just be what we need to give us back some confidence.""  After succeeding Leonardo Jardim at the Monaco helm, in just one week Henry has ""introduced a degree of tactical flexibility"" into Monaco's game, said midfielder Youri Tielemans, who knows Henry well from his previous role as an assistant to Roberto Martinez in the Belgium set-up.  Henry expects a tough game at the Jan Breydelstadion against a team with ""quality"" players who ""know how to fight till the end"".  But the 41-year-old Frenchman has insisted on instilling a degree of optimism and is adopting a philosophical approach as he looks for the performance that will help Monaco believe again.  ""We're not in a situation where we can laugh about things, but we have to combine respect, humility, hard work and joy,"" said Henry.  ""It's always easier to work when there's joy.""  Henry's first game in charge as coach was marked by a 17th-minute opener for Strasbourg and a sending-off which left Monaco, now 24 points adrift of leaders Paris Saint-Germain, fighting for the scraps.  But the World Cup winner insists his Champions League debut as coach cannot come quick enough.  ""It's good for us to have this match right after Strasbourg, so we can try and regain some confidence and not think too much about certain things.  ""We're looking for a win or a really good performance as quickly as possible.""",SPORTS,Real
Silvas Star as Manchester City Cruise Past Shakhtar Donetsk ,"Manchester City found their Champions League mojo as David Silva and Bernardo Silva both scored in a comfortable 3-0 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk in Kharkiv on Tuesday.  Pep Guardiola's men have now won back-to-back matches in Europe after a shock opening loss to Lyon, and lead the French side by one point at the top of Group F.  The English champions could potentially secure a last-16 spot if they beat Shakhtar in the return match at the Etihad in a fortnight's time as they bid for a maiden Champions League triumph.  David Silva put City ahead on the half-hour mark, before Aymeric Laporte doubled the advantage and Bernardo Silva scored just two minutes after coming off the bench.  Guardiola was able to give Kevin De Bruyne his first start of the season after the midfielder returned as a substitute against Burnley on Saturday following a two-month layoff with a knee injury.  City, the bookmakers' favourites for the European crown this term, started far better than in the two previous games which had seen them beaten 2-1 at home by Lyon and need a late David Silva winner to edge out Hoffenheim.  Riyad Mahrez fired wide midway through the opening half, before David Silva saw a header bounce away off the post.  But the Spanish winger made no mistake just seconds later, as he reacted quickest after Gabriel Jesus' shot was blocked and fired a magnificent volley low into the bottom corner.  The visitors did not need to wait long to pull further clear, and De Bruyne was the creator.  The Belgian's vicious 35th-minute corner was cleverly headed home by a totally unmarked Laporte, who did well to focus on the ball as John Stones leapt in front of him.  City continued to dominate after half-time, with David Silva seeing an effort cleared off the line and both Mahrez and Nicolas Otamendi shooting off target.  But the third goal arrived with 19 minutes to play as Bernardo Silva waltzed through the middle of the Shakhtar defence and drilled the ball in off the inside of the post.  Visiting goalkeeper Ederson Moraes kept out a late effort from Junior Moraes to preserve his clean sheet, as City claimed successive Champions League victories for the first time since winning their first five group-stage games last season.",SPORTS,Real
Super Dorronsoro Garners a Point for Delhi Dynamos Against Chennaiyin FC ,"New Delhi: Goalkeeper Francisco Dorronsoro produced a stellar performance under the bar as Delhi Dynamos held defending champions Chennaiyin FC to an engaging goalless draw in a Hero Indian Super League match on Tuesday.  Chennaiyin FC had the better chances but could not beat the Spanish goalkeeper who refused to concede with brilliant saves throughout the match.  The visitors couldn't get a breakthrough but the point earned lifted them from the bottom of the table. Both the teams are still searching for their first win of the season.  Andrea Orlandi could have opened the scoring for Chennaiyin FC as early as the second minute of the match. The midfielder rose the highest to head a corner kick from Isaac V but Dorronsoro got down low to pull off a stunning reflex save.  Raphael Augusto then looked to be in the mood to score as the trickster surged up the field from midfield before taking aim from 40 yards but his piledriver lacked enough force to trouble Dorronsoro.  The Delhi goalkeeper was called into action again five minutes from half-time. A defence-splitting through-ball by Augusto released Carlos Salom behind the backline. The striker squared the ball to an unmarked Thoi Singh who took a touch before sending a powerful strike that was kept out.  Delhi's first shot of the game came at the stroke of half-time. Lallianzuala Chhangte beat his marker on the left flank, burst forward before crossing perfectly towards Andrija Kaludjerovic. The striker headed the ball first-time and forced goalkeeper Karanjit Singh to a save.  The hosts were struggling to find gaps at the other end. Kaludjerovic cut an isolated figure up front and crosses into the box were dealt well by the Chennaiyin backline.  The defending champions had a glorious chance to score a breakthrough goal in the 70th minute when a cleared corner kick turned into a counter-attack.  Augusto released Isaac into space down the left flank. The winger surged forward and squared the ball to an unmarked Salom whose shot was brilliantly saved by the onrushing goalkeeper.  The Delhi custodian put on a fine show under the bar. The Spaniard flew out from his line to punch away a delightful cross from the left by Thoi as the Lions held on for a point.",SPORTS,Real
PV Sindhu Breezes Past Beiwen Zhang Into Second Round of French Open ,"Paris: India's ace shuttler PV Sindhu breezed into the second round of the women's singles event at French Open after crushing Beiwen Zhang in straight games for a revenge win on Tuesday.  Sindhu, seeded third, disposed off unseeded Zhang 21-17 21-8 in just 34 minutes to avenge her loss at the hands of the same opponent in the opening round of the Denmark Open, last week.  By virtue of this win, Sindhu has managed to break her hat-trick of losses against the American and equalled the head-to-head record at 3-3.  The agony of first-round exit at Denmark Open still in her mind, Sindhu, however, started slowly as Zhang took a marginal lead. But the Indian rode on her aggressive approach to roar back to a 7-4 and then a 10-6 lead.  The American then stunned her fancied opponent to pocket five straight points to reclaim the lead at 11-10.  It was neck-and-neck thereafter till 16 points before Sindhu seized the initiative and pocketed the first game 21-17.  The second game too was a close affair initially as both the players were locked at 3-3 at one stage before world no. 3 Sindhu upped her game to take an 11-6 lead.  Zhang managed to garner two more points before Sindhu sealed the affair in quick time.  The Rio Olympics silver medallist will next face the winner of first-round match between Cheung Ngan Yi of Hong Kong and Japan's Sayaka Sato.  However, it was curtains for less-fancied Indian men's doubles pair of Arjun M R and Shlok Ramachandran as they lost 14-21 17-21 to Chinese pair of Li Junhui and Liu Yunchen in the opening round.",SPORTS,Real
Bayern Edge Out AEK to Move Top of Group ,"Quick-fire goals by Javi Martinez and Robert Lewandowski on Tuesday moved Bayern Munich top of their Champions League group with a 2-0 win at AEK Athens, as they made it back-to-back victories after a difficult start to the season.  Dogged defending by the reigning Greek champions left Bayern facing a frustrating draw until Martinez finally broke through with an hour gone at AEK, who travel to the Allianz Arena in a fortnight's time.  ""It was very difficult, the pitch was not good, we played well in the first half, but the final pass was missing,"" said Arjen Robben.  ""We started using our chances and once Javi got the first goal, you could feel the relief. This was an important win for us.""  The result leaves Bayern top of Group E and puts pressure on nearest rivals Ajax, who earned a 1-1 draw in Munich three weeks ago, to beat Benfica in Amsterdam later on Tuesday and join the Germans on seven points, while AEK remain bottom after three straight defeats.  Bayern have never lost a European game in Greece, but despite breaking a four-match winless streak with a 3-1 victory at Wolfsburg on Saturday in the Bundesliga, the German champions laboured until Martinez scored with an athletic half-volley.  The hosts' best chance of the match came on the 20th minute when Argentinian striker Ezequiel Ponce held off Bayern defender Mats Hummels, but fired wide.  At the other end, Thiago Alcantara's pass rolled agonisingly away from Bayern striker Lewandowski.  Just as it was looking like AEK might earn their first point in the group stage, Bayern turned the game.  Hummels picked out Robben, whose effort was blocked, but the ball flew towards Martinez, who slammed his shot home.  Any frustrations in the Bayern ranks disappeared and just two minutes later they struck again.  Serge Gnabry, a constant threat on the right wing, played in Rafinha inside the box with a clever backheel, and the Brazilian's low cross found Lewandowski unmarked to tap home and delight the travelling fans.  It was Lewandowski's third goal in two games after also netting twice at Wolfsburg.  Thiago tried an acrobatic volley of his own with 15 minutes left which flew wide as Bayern kept on the pressure to safeguard the three points.",SPORTS,Real
Federer Digs Deep to Reach Basel Second Round ,"Roger Federer had to fight hard to hold off Serbia's Filip Krajinovic on Tuesday, edging to a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 win to reach the second round of the Swiss Indoors.  The eight-time champion flirted with his earliest exit in Basel since his 1998 debut as a teenager, but came out on top in a nervy deciding set.  ""I also knew that he was feeling the pressure, that was something I needed,"" said Federer. ""It was a very close win, very tough.""  Earlier, Jan-Lennard Struff ended the possibility of a rematch between Federer and his US Open conqueror John Millman by beating the Australian 7-6 (7/3), 6-2.  Krajinovic appeared to be on the way to a straight-sets loss in his first meeting with the 20-time Grand Slam winner before the momentum began to turn.  Up a set and a break, the Swiss lost serve in the sixth game of the second set before his opponent managed to square the match with a break in game 10.  The top seed went up an early break in the third and broke Krajinovic in an 11-minute game for a 5-2 lead, only to fail to serve out the match at the first time of asking.  But he clinched victory on his second match point to take his career record at the tournament to 67-9 as he bids to reach a 12th successive final at St. Jakobshalle.  The 37-year-old Federer, who revealed earlier this week that he had been struggling with a hand injury since the grass-court season, last lost at the Swiss Indoors in 2013, going down to Juan Martin del Potro.  Seventh seed Daniil Medvedev, a semi-finalist last week in Moscow, saw off German Maximilian Marterer 6-3, 7-5.  Russian Medvedev stands at a career-high ranking of 20th, with three titles this season and will next face Andreas Seppi after the Italian defeated Japan's Taro Daniel 6-0, 6-4.",SPORTS,Real
Never-Say-Die Esperance Reach CAF Champions League Final ,"Anice Badri scored his seventh CAF Champions League goal this season to give Esperance of Tunisia a 4-2 victory over Primeiro Agosto of Angola on Tuesday and a place in the final.  With 85 minutes played in the semi-final second leg, the Tunisians were leading 3-2 in Rades but trailing on away goals after losing the first leg 1-0 in Luanda.  Esperance goalkeeper Rami Jeridi then launched a long clearance that Haythem Jouini headed on and Badri took advantage of a deflection to score the decisive goal from close range.  It was the first time in the two-leg, 180-minute tie that Esperance led on aggregate and they survived a frenetic finish for a famous 4-3 overall victory.  Mohamed Belaili, Mohamed Ali Yakoubi, Jouini and Badri scored for Esperance and Geraldo and Lompala Bokamba for Primeiro in a seesaw showdown at the Stade Olympique near Tunis.  Geraldo put Primeiro ahead on eight minutes before Belaili converted a penalty and Yakoubi scored with a diving header to give the two-time African champions a 2-1 half-time lead.  A Jeridi howler gifted Bokamba an equaliser midway through the second half before a Jouini tap-in on 73 minutes edged Esperance 3-2 ahead on the night.  Primeiro thought they had scored a third goal soon after when Beadrik Ungenda netted in a goalmouth scramble, but it was ruled out by the overworked Zambian referee.  It was a surprise scoreline with Esperance scoring four goals for the first time in 12 matches and Primeiro conceding more than one in the Champions League for the first time this year.  Esperance will be away in the first leg of the final next month to Entente Setif of Algeria or Al Ahly of Egypt, who meet in Setif later Tuesday.  Record eight-time champions Ahly lead 2-0 from the first leg in Cairo and are expected to set up a repeat of the 2012 title decider in which they beat decades-old rivals Esperance.  There was plenty of off-field drama, too, with the flares that were flung on the pitch after the second Primeiro goal making visibility difficult.  Primeiro goalkeeper Adao 'Tony' Cabaca was affected by the smoke and after several appeals for medical assistance, eventually received help.  A small group of supporters played a cat-and-mouse game with the police, hurling various objects, retreating, then coming back to taunt them again.",SPORTS,Real
Caroline Wozniacki Stands Firm to Stay Alive in Singapore ,"Caroline Wozniacki overcame a mid-match wobble and withstood a barrage of big hitting to get her WTA Finals title defence back on track with a 7-5 3-6 6-2 victory over Petra Kvitova at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Tuesday.  Both players came into the contest on the back of opening defeats in round robin play but the Danish world number three ended a run of four straight defeats to the Czech to stay alive in the eight-woman tournament for at least one more match.  Wozniacki, who started her White Group campaign with a 6-2 6-4 loss to Karolina Pliskova on Sunday, spent most of the match against Kvitova pinned on the baseline but her consistency and patience proved vital as she pulled away in the final set.  ""I played much better today. I served and returned pretty well, and moved really well against a player who is so powerful that you have to stay on your game,"" Wozniacki said  ""You never know what is going to happen against Petra, so I just stayed focused and got a lot of balls back.""  The match was a cagey affair from the outset with seven holds of serve in a row. But after they traded breaks as the intensity levels picked up, Wozniacki broke again to seal the opener when Kvitova blasted a forehand into the net.  Kvitova took control of the second set with an early break, then lost momentum when Wozniacki took a timeout for treatment on her knee, before she regained the upper hand to level the match with a sliced backhand winner on her third set point.  Sensing her title defence was in tatters, Wozniacki regrouped to break at the start of the decider when she put away a backhand to win the longest rally of the match, and ran away with the contest as Kvitova wilted in the final set.  The 28-year-old Wozniacki sealed victory on her first match point with a big serve that Kvitova sent long, and will hope to win her final match of round robin play against Elina Svitolina to secure a semi-final berth.  ""I just always believe in myself, that I am going to win when I go out on court. I was just out there, had the belief and fought to the end,"" Wozniacki added.  The Ukrainian Svitolina, who beat Kvitova in her opening match, takes on big-serving Czech Pliskova in Tuesday's second match with the winner almost virtually assured of advancing to the last four.

ISL 2018/19: FC Goa Hoping to Keep Momentum Going Against Mumbai City ,"Goa: Having registered their first victory of the season, FC Goa would look to keep the winning momentum going when they take on Mumbai City FC at home in a Hero Indian Super League match here on Wednesday.  With four points from two games, the Gaurs have made a positive start to the fifth season of the tournament.   Sergio Lobera's men would have been a little disappointed to walk away with a 2-2 draw in their opening fixture against NorthEast United FC but made their intentions clear in the next game with a stunning 3-1 win away from home against defending champions Chennaiyin FC.  Despite losing the services of prolific playmaker Manuel Lanzarote to ATK, Goa boasts of strong attacking line and they proved that by scoring five goals scored in two matches so far.  Last season's Golden Boot winner Ferran Corominas has shown no signs of slowing down and has already scored three goals in two appearances.  ""We always try to play an attacking brand of football and the idea is to win the game. That's the most important thing. If you're asking me if we are going to attack less so that we don't concede, the answer is no. The idea is simple which is to try and attack like we did last year,"" said Goa coach Lobera.  In defence, Mourtada Fall has been an excellent addition with the Senegalese adept at bringing the ball out from the back. Chinglensana Singh too has shown improvement in his defensive abilities.  Mumbai City, on the other hand, come into game on the back of an impressive 2-0 win over FC Pune City in the first Maharashtra derby of the season.   Jorge Costa's men had a stuttering start to their campaign with a home defeat against Jamshedpur FC followed by a 1-1 draw against Kerala Blasters.  ""Goa have a very good team and a very good coach. It's easy to understand what they want to do on the pitch. I will not speak of individual players but we are going to have a difficult game for sure. We respect them a lot but we also know what to do,"" said Costa.  Costa will be glad to see Senegalese strike Modou Sougou get off the mark against Pune. He would also be hoping for Brazilian Rafael Bastos to find his form after a lacklustre start to the campaign.   Mumbai's attack had been toothless at the start with the Brazilian struggling for any rhythm but his penalty against Pune might just get his confidence back.   Arnold Issoko has looked like an inspired buy for Mumbai with the Congolese showing his prowess in a man-of-the-match display in the Maharashtra derby. ",SPORTS,Real
I-League: Debutants Real Kashmir Hoping Home Comforts Help in Making it Another Year to Remember ,"New Delhi: For a state like Jammu and Kashmir that has been battling to survive the onslaught that results from a fractious relationship between India and Pakistan, the emergence of Real Kashmir FC in Srinagar has not only brought top flight football to the state for the first time but also is a breath of fresh air.   The club began their journey in 2016 after co-owners Shamim Meraj and Sandeep Chattoo felt it was essential to provide the youth of the state a positive outlet.  “It is a great feeling for us that we are the first team from our state to play in the I-League. Many young boys and girls are playing football nowadays and we feel happy seeing that,” Danish Farooq, the 22-year-old who’s penalty helped the team achieve qualification, said.  Having qualified for the top flight at the expense of Hindustan FC from Delhi in May, the David Robertson-managed side is looking to make a mark in the country’s premier competition, the I-League. The debutants will open their campaign against the defending champions Minerva Punjab (October 31st) in Panchkula, before heading back for a string of home games. Their first home game will be against Goan side Churchill Brothers on November 6th.  Coach Robertson, who has roped in his son Mason into the squad as one of the six foreigners, understands the upcoming season will not be an easy one for his side. The Scot not only has kept his eyes and ears open as he tried to blend talent, experience and youth into his side, but also emphasised that the players coming in needed to be able to keep up the team spirit and camaraderie.  “We begin our journey against the champions (Minerva Punjab) away from home before coming back for six games. That’s where we need to capitalise and get our points, because otherwise suddenly you’ll be in a position of no return and getting demoted will be terrible for the team and the people,” Robertson explains on the sidelines of a promotional event with sportswear giants Adidas. The German company are the kit sponsors for Real Kashmir FC.  “It will definitely be difficult to be one of the title contenders for the season, but I believe with a bit of luck we can finish hopefully in the top half.”  Local Support Can be Our 12th Man  Initially, there was a possibility that Real Kashmir would not be able to play their home games at their favoured Tourist Reception Centre (TRC) ground, but after multiple inspections following the upgradation of facilities, the stadium will play host to its first I-League game on November 6th.  The team’s coach and players were relieved that they will play their home game in Srinagar and an elated club co-owner Shamim Meraj said, “We have things in place (to host I-League games). The capacity of the ground is 10,000 but we will have to cap it to around 6,000 to ensure everything goes smoothly.”  On the big opening day, security arrangements are expected to be boosted as both club and authorities want things to go through without a hiccup.  “I am expecting to see a very noisey bunch at the ground. I’ve seen how a crowd can motivate players and teams and I hope the local crowd in Srinagar can do the same, be our 12th man,” Robertson, the former Aberdeen and Rangers FC player, said.  However, more than a vibrant crowd what is more likely to fit the home advantage bill for Real Kashmir will be the difficult conditions traveling teams will face in Srinagar.  Club captain Loveday Enyinnaya, a Nigerian professional who has turned out for a whole host of Indian clubs like Malabar United F.C., Royal Wahingdoh F.C., Sporting clube de Goa and Minerva Punjab F.C., believes his side is not under any pressure and that it will be up to the others to play well against them in difficult conditions.  “It will be difficult for teams coming to play against us because of the weather. When I had come here initially, I faced problems with the cold to start with, but now I have adjusted. The others won’t find it easy,” says Loveday with a mischievous grin.",SPORTS,Real
"AIFF Intent on Restructuring Indian Football, But Road Ahead Remains Unclear ","Ahead of the 2017/18 edition of the I-League, the biggest talking point among fans and experts alike was the fact that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) had decided to keep the Indian football team that featured in the FIFA U-17 World Cup together as the ‘Indian Arrows’ in a bid to further develop the burgeoning talents.   Yet perhaps the biggest elephant in the room – the fact that the I-League and the Indian Super League (ISL) would be running simultaneously for the first time ahead of a major restructure of the domestic football system – was not addressed at the time.   One year later and with the potential threat of an Asian ban looming should they fail to unify the two leagues by the 2019/20 season, the AIFF unsurprisingly chose to address the issue head on.   “Let us look at the bigger picture. We are talking about restructuring the league and we have a holistic plan for that where we are going to take all the leagues into account and make a better league structure so that India can perform better internationally,” AIFF senior vice-president Subrata Dutta said at the I-League launch in New Delhi on Tuesday.   Yet while it was refreshing to hear that the AIFF were finally looking to merge the two domestic leagues, there are a number of issues that must be addressed before the huge decision is finally taken.   Earlier this year, news broke of a FIFA-backed report that suggested an Asian ban for Indian clubs should they fail to come up with a unified league by the next season.   The report was refuted by AIFF general secretary Kushal Das, who stated that he was yet to receive any report from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and that a decision will be taken in due course.   Complicated Roadmap   However, coming up with a new system will be complicated to say the least considering the fact that an arrangement currently exists that sees the ISL clubs get a 10-year immunity from relegation from 2014 onwards.   Even though the FIFA report called for a review of that and some other arrangements, there is every possibility that it could be upheld even after it is evaluated by the necessary authorities.   This would mean that ISL clubs will not be relegated from 2019-23 while I-League clubs will be both promoted and relegated as the report stated that the new league must become a 16-team tournament by 2023.   More tellingly, this arrangement will see the majority of the I-League clubs – which include legacy sides like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan among others – excluded from the new merged league, at least in the initial stages.   For his part, Dutta stated that it would be unwise to view the leagues individually as the plan was to eventually freshen up the whole domestic league system in India.   “We should not analyse just one league. We should include ISL, we should include I-League and we should include age-group leagues as well as think about the second division league since they all add value to football in our country,” Dutta said.   Yet to not view the ISL and I-League as separate entities given the differing natures of both tournaments is something of an exercise in futility.   One league has been in existence for only five years and has massive financial backing whereas the other began in 1996 as the National Football League and features some of India’s most successful clubs yet has never had the kind of exposure the new league did.   There’s also the fact that I-League clubs tend to enjoy better in-stadium attendance, something the ISL has struggled with especially after the league began to run for longer than two months.   Including the ISL clubs in the revamped league structure makes sense given the amount of money that has been invested in them, yet a truly holistic approach will be needed if the benefits of the reforms are to be enjoyed by all Indian clubs.

Facing Atletico is like 'Toothache' for Dortmund Goal-ace Paco Alcacer ,"Goal machine Paco Alcacer says playing against Atletico Madrid feels like 'toothache' -- and he hopes to extract maximum revenge for past suffering when Borussia Dortmund meet them in Wednesday's Champions League clash.   The 26-year-old, on loan from Barcelona, has needed just 109 minutes to score seven Bundesliga goals this season -- the best goal-rate in the league's history, which included a deft chip in Saturday's 4-0 drubbing of Stuttgart to keep Dortmund top of the table.  In total, Alcacer has netted 11 goals in his last seven games for club and country, but now has Atletico in his sights for the Group A showdown with both teams having won their first two games.  ""A toothache to play against Atletico? Well, yes, totally,"" Alcacer told Spanish newspaper Marca, having lost six of his nine games against Atletico for either former clubs Getafe or Valencia. He never faced them while with Barcelona.  ""They are a team that concede very few goals and they leave few spaces, while they're always very aware of everything.  ""For a striker, it's frustrating.""  However, his form has been anything but 'frustrating' since arriving in Dortmund in August after two unhappy seasons at Barcelona, where his path to the first-team was blocked by Luiz Suarez.  Alcacer's goal exploits quickly wrote him into Dortmund's footballing folklore.  ""The freedom is playing, having minutes and enjoying the profession. I didn't have the minutes at Barcelona and now I am having them, things are going well,"" he added.  'Always in my Mind, Papa'  However, each goal he scores also carries a tragic reminder.  When he scored at Stuttgart on Saturday, he raised his arms to celebrate, as does after each goal, and looked to the heavens with the words ""Always in my mind, Papa"" tattooed on his left bicep.  Alcacer was still a teenager when his world was turned upside down on the first game of the 2011/12 season.  His father Francisco died of a heart-attack while leaving the stadium after watching his son play in a friendly for former club Valencia against Roma.  His father would no doubt be proud of what his son has achieved in just a few weeks at Dortmund, who have told Barcelona they want to sign him permanently, with his value estimated at around 30 million euros ($34.4m).  Alcacer endeared himself to Dortmund fans by scoring on his debut off the bench against Eintracht Frankfurt in mid September.  In his next game, he added two more, again as a sub, against Leverkusen.  Then followed a stunning hat-trick in just 31 minutes as a second-half replacement against Augsburg on October 6, which included a stunning 96th-minute winner by banging in a superb free-kick just before the final whistle to seal a 4-3 comeback win.  ""We had hoped that he would fit, but we hadn't dared hope that he would score like that,"" admitted Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc.  On top of his Bundesliga goals, Alcacer also scored in the 3-0 win at home to Monaco at the start of the month, then claimed three goals in two games last week on his return to the Spain team after a two year hiatus.   Now comes Atletico, led by their French goal-king Antoine Griezmann, and Alcacer could well be the source of an uncomfortable night for the Spanish team at Signal Iduna Park.  ""It's clear that Atletico are a great team and a great club, a top club. But we need to make things difficult for them and go from there,"" said Alcacer.",SPORTS,Real

Infantino Plans for New Global Tournaments Back on FIFA Agenda ,"Manchester: FIFA president Gianni Infantino's plans for two new global tournaments are back on the agenda at the governing body with soccer officials set to discuss the proposals on Friday.  FIFA's ruling council meets in Kigali, Rwanda and Infantino's plan for a new 'mini World Cup' and an expanded Club World Cup feature among the items for discussion according to the agenda document.  FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment and it was not clear if the plans will be put to a vote.  Infantino wrote to FIFA Council members in May outlining his plans which he says are backed by a 'solid and serious' group of investors willing to spend $25 billion over a 12-year cycle starting in 2021.  The letter did not outline the identity of the investors but several media reports have stated that Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group is heading the consortium.  However, the plans were strongly opposed by clubs and leagues in Europe and UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said the plans were 'highly cynical and ruthless mercantilism' and accused FIFA of selling the soul of the game.  The plans did not feature on the agenda of FIFA's congress in Moscow in June.  Infantino's proposals would bring about major changes to the international calendar.  The proposals outline what would effectively be a mini-World Cup, featuring eight international teams, every two years in addition to the traditional event.  The tournament, known as the 'Final 8', would be the climax of a proposed global Nations League competition.  In the May letter, it was suggested that the new tournament would take place every October and/or November of every odd year starting from 2021. The Confederations Cup, currently staged every four years in a year before the World Cup, would be abolished.  The annual Club World Cup, which currently features seven teams, would be expanded to 24 teams and moved to once every four years, according to the proposals.",SPORTS,Real
Smart Assistant Technology Puts F1 Fans' Fingers on the Pulse ,"U.S. Grand Prix winner Kimi Raikkonen has always been known as 'The Iceman' but Formula One fans could soon have much more of an insight into just how cool he really is in the heat of battle.  The winner of this year's $50,000 Tata Communications F1 Innovation Prize aims to harness smart assistant technology, such as Amazon's Alexa, so that fans can customise their experience of a race.  Briton James Gough's idea would deliver personalised, contextual data to fans through voice, text, and gesture command.  So, for example, if someone wanted to compare Raikkonen's heart-rate to that of current Ferrari team mate Sebastian Vettel or Mercedes' world champion Lewis Hamilton during a race, they could do so with a voice command.  Ross Brawn, Formula One's managing director for motorsports, hailed it as a development that the Liberty Media-owned sport would incubate further as part of its digital transformation.  ""We want to see where this takes us,"" he told Reuters.  ""It's a fascinating area, the engagement of fans and the whole technological side. And it's moving so quickly. So it fits perfectly with what we are doing in Formula One and where we're heading.  ""Imagine you are sat there watching a race and you say to your assistant 'How do the tyre temperatures compare on those two cars?' Ping! up it comes. That would be another level of engagement for a fan.  ""'What's the heart rate of the two drivers fighting out at the front of the grid?' Ping! Up it comes.""  Brawn said there was still some resistance to change, with teams protective of data and wary of divulging too many secrets, but there was also a growing understanding that Formula One was entering a new world.  ""This is going to be the next phase of fan engagement in Formula One. The fact that you pick your profile and cocktail of viewing you want and you vary it and shape it exactly how you want it,"" he said.  ""It's like listening to a playlist. Someone's put together their music and you start there and modify it to suit you. Everyone's experience is different.""  HAMILTON KEEN  Hamilton, who can clinch his fifth world championship in Mexico this weekend, said he liked the idea of that and of making the sport more accessible.  ""There are ways of thinking within the sport that have not shifted for many years. But we are in a period of time where Formula One does need to move forward so it's really great,"" he told Reuters.  ""There are so many people in my family who do not understand what is going on,"" he added. ""You just see cars going around, you can't relate to it... there are so many areas in which you are not getting information.  ""People are always asking about the weight, about how physical it is, how hard it is... But if you can utilise data to really explain those parameters and why it is so hard, I think it will just naturally make people more excited.""  Vinod Kumar, chief executive of Tata Communications who work with Formula One as 'technology enablers', said the winning idea catered for both the sophisticated fan and those relatively new to the sport.  He said all sports were entering new territory, with real life and virtual experiences beginning to converge thanks to technology.  ""It's going to be a far more immersive experience and then there will be a blurring of lines between what physically takes place and what virtually takes place,"" he said of the future.  ""I love the fact that in the winning idea there is an integration of personal assistant technology. That's going to become pervasive and it will allow fans to get involved deeper and deeper in the sports.  ""Formula One is perfectly suited to it because its technologically is so advanced and always at the forefront and I think there's an opportunity for Formula One to lead the way for many other sports.""",SPORTS,Real
A-League Club Central Coast Mariners Confirm Offer to Olympic Champion Bolt ,"Sydney: Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt has been offered a professional contract by Australian A-League outfit the Central Coast Mariners but a deal is unlikely without an external third party financial contribution, the club said on Tuesday.  The 32-year-old Jamaican, a passionate football fan, has been on trial at the club since August as he attempts to make an audacious switch to a second professional sport after one of the most decorated careers in athletics.  ""The club can confirm that a contract proposal has been offered by the Central Coast Mariners and negotiations remain ongoing with Usain Bolt and his management regarding his football future,"" the Mariners said in a statement.  ""The Central Coast Mariners want to ensure that Usain Bolt is given every chance possible to fulfil his dream to become a professional football player.""  Despite two goals in one pre-season friendly, Bolt's performances for the Mariners have not been overly impressive and manager Mike Mulvey suggested at the weekend that the Jamaican would not on current form be worth a place in his side.  The club said Bolt had made ""great progression"" in his time at the Gosford-based club and they were looking at ways to give him ""more individual intensive training and competitive game time"" but that it would have to be away from the A-League.  The club statement said the other main discussion point in negotiations was around commercial matters.  'COMMERCIAL SOLUTION'  Football Federation Australia (FFA) has made it clear that the ""marquee"" money that has in the past helped Australian clubs lure the likes of Italian forward Alessandro Del Piero to the A-League would not be available to sign Bolt.  Home crowds for the Mariners last season averaged just over 7,000 but the club said that while they would need third party help to fund a deal, media reports that it could be worth as little as A$150,000 ($106,185) a season were ""inaccurate"".  ""Usain Bolt's management and the Central Coast Mariners are in conversations with external partners to find a commercial solution that suits all parties,"" read the statement.  ""Without the financial contribution of an external third-party, it is unlikely that Usain Bolt and the Central Coast Mariners will agree to terms.""  According to Forbes, eight-times Olympic gold medallist Bolt was earning upwards of $20 million a year mostly from endorsements before his retirement from athletics in 2017.  Last week, he turned down an offer of a two-year contract from Maltese outfit Valletta FC and his representatives have made it clear that he is the subject of interest from other European clubs.  Bolt will not train with the Mariners until a deal is finalised, the statement added.",SPORTS,Real
Lionel Messi Injury Gives Barcelona and Dembele Chance to Prove Their Worth ,"Barcelona's lowest ebbs are invariably followed by questions about Lionel Messi but the issue of over-reliance may become clearer over the coming weeks.  The sight of Messi on the ground, grasping his right arm, during Barca's win over Sevilla on Saturday prompted reactions inside Camp Nou normally reserved for the conceding of goals.   Hands behind heads, fingers over mouths, the concern became real shortly after the final whistle when the club confirmed Messi had fractured his radial bone.   His absence leaves Barca vulnerable when they need him most, for a run of fixtures that includes Inter Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday, the Clasico against Real Madrid on Sunday, before a return match against Inter in Italy at the start of next month.   If he takes longer than expected to recover, he could miss tricky games against Real Betis and Atletico Madrid in La Liga too.   Barcelona have grown used to accusations of dependence, not least when results have taken a turn for the worse.   When Ernesto Valverde left Messi on the bench for the 1-1 draw at home to Athletic Bilbao last month, the argument was given added weight by him coming on and making the assist for their equaliser.   ""This is Barcelona,"" Messi afterwards. ""We have a strong team and we have enough not to have to depend on one player.""   The same point was raised last season, when Messi, as a substitute, inspired a late fightback from two goals down against Sevilla and scored in the 89th minute.   He played the entirety of the Champions League collapse against Roma but then the criticism was Barca had failed to find the answer when Messi had not provided it.  There is no team in the world that would not look worse with Messi extracted.   'Casting for Replacements'  As Real Madrid are proving in the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo, a striker's goals are difficult to replace but so too is the aura.   ""Emotionally we know when Messi is there he gives us more confidence because he is the best in the world,"" Pique said on Saturday. ""But it does not have to affect us.""   To maintain a resurgence built on wins over Tottenham and Sevilla, as well as a draw away to Valencia, Valverde will have to find the solution.   On Monday, Marca listed six options in a ""casting for replacements"" - Ousmane Dembele, Rafinha, Munir El Haddadi, Malcom, Carles Alena and Sergi Roberto.   Alena, the 20-year-old midfielder, is an exciting talent, while Malcom, only a year older, scored 12 goals for Bordeaux last season.   But Dembele is the most obvious. Messi's position on the right of the front three is where he is most comfortable, rather than off the left, where the 21-year-old has often been made to adapt so far.   After a debut season blighted by injuries, Dembele started the first six games of this one, scoring five goals.   But doubts remain about him in big games, where his habit for losing possession can be punished by opponents quick in transition and clinical on the counter-attack.   When Barca went three matches without a win, he was dropped. ""He is not yet fully aware of what it means to play at the highest level,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps last month. ""He still needs to learn,"" Valverde said last weekend.   It would be a surprise if Dembele was not at least given the chance at Camp Nou against Inter, who are level on points with Barca in Group B, having also beaten PSV Eindhoven and Tottenham.   Second place might have been the limit of Inter's ambitions when the draw was made but with Messi out, they might spy an opportunity. ""It is a pity,"" said Mauro Icardi. ""And a big blow for them.""",SPORTS,Real
Returning Cristiano Ronaldo Out to Heap Pressure on Old Club Man United ,"Cristiano Ronaldo hopes to pile more pressure on his old club Manchester United and put allegations of rape to one side when he steps out for Italian giants Juventus at Old Trafford in the Champions League Tuesday.   Ronaldo made his name in Manchester, winning the first of his five Champions League and three Premier League titles under the tutelage of Alex Ferguson, for whom he still retains the highest regard.  ""To return here to Manchester for me is a huge emotion. When we were drawn together I remembered the history I made here. I won all the trophies: Champions League, leagues, cups,"" said a smiling Ronaldo in a pre-match press conference.  ""I remembered the incredible fans and a person that I don't forget, who was one of the people that helped me most, Sir Alex Ferguson.""  However, Ronaldo also inflicted one of Ferguson's biggest disappointments.  Having swapped Manchester for Real Madrid for a world record fee in 2009, Ronaldo was given a hero's welcome in his only previous return to Old Trafford but ultimately scored the winning goal to edge a contentious Champions League last-16 tie in the Spanish side's favour in 2013.  That proved to be Ferguson's final European match, and in the legendary Scot's retirement, United have fallen on hard times in Europe.  In the five years since, Ronaldo has won the Champions League four times with Madrid, while United have won just one knockout tie in Europe's top club competition.  More Than Contenders   Both sides are on course to make the last 16 this season. Juventus top Group H with a perfect record from comfortable victories over Young Boys and Valencia and United have taken four points from a possible six against the same opponents.  However, in large part due to Ronaldo's talismanic status in the Champions League, it is Juventus, who paid Madrid 112 million euros ($129 million) for the 33-year-old in July, and not United, who are being touted as contenders to win the competition, even by the English side's own manager Jose Mourinho.  ""As far as I'm concerned, Juventus are more than just a contender this season to win the Champions League,"" said Mourinho.  ""They have a really special player (Ronaldo), who makes a real difference as well.""  Top scorer in the Champions League for the past six seasons, Ronaldo has been made to wait to make an impact for Juventus.   Sent-off just half an hour into his European debut for the club at Valencia, he also sat out a 3-0 win over Young Boys three weeks ago due to suspension.  ""My last two months in Juve was amazing. Everything goes well, my adaptation goes well, and the team is amazing,"" insisted Ronaldo, despite the off-field turmoil.  A former American model Kathryn Mayorga, 34, has accused Ronaldo of raping her on June 13, 2009, just before he joined Real Madrid from United. Ronaldo has vigorously denied the allegations and has been backed by his new club.  ""It doesn't matter if I play or get sent-off. The most important (thing) is that we have six points, we are in a good position and I'm glad to be back,"" he added.  The threat of a hungry Ronaldo is dangerous for Mourinho, who is still under pressure despite encouraging recent results.  United battled back from behind for a dramatic 3-2 win over Newcastle and a creditable 2-2 draw at Chelsea on Saturday, but are still languishing nine points off the top of the Premier League in 10th.  ""I think the last games proved that we can play, press forward and we have players to make the difference,"" insisted United striker Romelu Lukaku.  ""The challenge of tomorrow is to win the game against a really difficult side, but we'll do our best and see where we stand against one of the best teams in Europe.”",SPORTS,Real
Last-gasp Spurs Fightback Thwarts LeBron James and Lakers ,"An overtime fightback from the San Antonio Spurs left LeBron James waiting for his first win with the Los Angeles Lakers in a high-scoring thriller at the Staples Center on Monday.  San Antonio ran out 143-142 winners after two late free throw misses from James allowed Patty Mills to drain a jump shot for the Spurs with seven seconds remaining to snatch victory.  Mills' late winner was the final act of a pulsating battle which saw the Lakers overturn a 128-120 deficit with a minute left in the fourth quarter to force overtime, with James raising the roof with a three-pointer to tie the game.  James had looked poised to lead the Lakers to their first victory of the regular season after they surged into a 141-136 lead with 55 seconds of overtime remaining.  But San Antonio regrouped to come storming back and when James missed two free throws that would have given the Lakers a three-point lead, Mills struck to give the Spurs the win.  The defeat left James reflecting on his first 0-3 start to the season since his rookie NBA year in 2003.  The 33-year-old was able to draw positives from the loss, however.  ""I know what I got myself into,"" James told reporters. ""It's a process. We'll be fine. I didn't come here thinking we were going to be blazing storms right out the gate.  ""We're going to continue to get better. I like the direction we're going in. Obviously we haven't got the results or the wins yet, but it's a long process.""  LaMarcus Aldridge led the scoring for San Antonio with 37 points while DeMar DeRozan added 32.  Kyle Kuzma top scored for the Lakers with 37 points as James finished with 32 points.  Lakers coach Luke Walton said his team could take positives from the game despite the defeat.  ""Overall, very pleased with our guys tonight,"" Walton said. ""That's three games we've had a chance to win now. Obviously it's about winning and losing at the end of the day.   ""It's a tough one to take but we'll be back in the gym tomorrow doing it all over again.""  Warriors Romp   Elsewhere Monday, reigning NBA Finals champions the Golden State Warriors improved to 3-1 in the Western Conference with a 123-103 demolition of the Phoenix Suns in Oakland.  Stephen Curry led the scoring with 29 points, 18 of his tally coming from three-point range. Kevin Durant added 22 points while Klay Thompson added 16.  Earlier, Nikola Vucevic weighed in with 24 points as the Orlando Magic defeated the Boston Celtics at the TD Garden in an Eastern Conference upset.  Montenegrin center Vucevic also hauled down 12 rebounds to give Orlando their second win of the season in a 93-90 victory.  Orlando surged into an early 28-19 lead at the end of the first quarter and held a 48-45 lead at half-time.  The Magic kept their noses in front for the entire contest, with Boston unable to take the lead at any stage as Orlando held on.   Four other Orlando players cracked double figures on a night when the scoring was shared around by the visitors.   Jonathan Isaac had 18 points while Evan Fournier (14) and Aaron Gordon (13) also contributed.  Boston, tipped as one of the favorites for the Eastern Conference title this season, struggled to get going.   Kyrie Irving finished with 22 points but it was a frustrating evening for the rest of the Celtics line-up with Al Horford restricted to 15 points and Gordon Hayward 11.   The Celtics had a chance to tie the game late in the fourth quarter but Hayward's three-pointer missed as the buzzer sounded.  In other games on Monday, the Toronto Raptors maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a 127-106 blowout over the Charlotte Hornets.  Kemba Walker had 26 points for Charlotte but the Raptors all-round scoring proved too much for the visitors.   Kawhi Leonard led the scoring for Toronto with 22 points, while four other players chipped in with double-digit tallies.   Jonas Valanciunas had 17 points off the bench while Kyle Lowry and Danny Green made 16 points apiece as the Raptors improved to 4-0.",SPORTS,Real

"Narayan Thakur: 100m Gold Winner in Asian Para Games Once Lived in Orphanage, Cleaned DTC Buses ","New Delhi: Narayan Thakur — who was born with a disability, lived in an orphanage for eight years, worked at dhabas, cleaned DTC buses — has achieved the near-impossible by becoming the only Indian to have won the athletics 100m Gold in the just concluded Asian Para Games in Jakarta.   A report in The Time of India said that Thakur suffers from left-sided hemiparesis, a condition in which a patient suffers paralysis of the left side of the body after a stroke of the brain.   The story of the 27-year-old para athlete, who even lived for a while in a jhuggi in northwest Delhi’s Samaypur Badli, is one of indomitable spirit overcoming all odds.  Thakur, who hails from Bihar, says the family moved to Delhi as his father was suffering from a heart condition. After his father's death, his mother was finding it difficult to take care of her three kids and it was then that Thakur was sent to an orphanage in Daryaganj. The young sprinter claims he got food to eat and a chance to study there.  “I wanted to play cricket, but somehow it did not happen. I left the orphanage so that I could look for other alternatives in sports,” Thakur told The Times of India.  Thakur says when he left the orphanage in 2010, his family suffered another cruel blow.  “That was the time when the jhuggis we in Samaypur Badli, where we lived then, were demolished. We had no option but to move to a nearby area. We had serious financial problems and to make ends meet I had to clean DTC buses and also double up as waiter at small roadside thelas (stalls). But I still had the spirit to pursue sports,” Thakur told The Times of India.   Thakur said the transition to athletics happened when someone advised him to try his hand at the sport at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium.   Once there, Thakur said he worked hard on his game and impressed all with his performance. This paved the way for his participation in the Jakarta Games.  “I am happy to have won the gold for India in Jakarta. I am the only Indian to have won the athletics 100m gold in an Asiad or Asian Para Games,” Thakur was quoted as saying by the paper.  Thakur was felicitated by the PM for his outstanding feat and given a cheque of Rs 40 lakh. He said he hopes to get some financial reward from the Delhi government as well.   Thakur, who doesn't have a job and helps his mother run a paan shop, is now optimistic that his life will change for good.",SPORTS,Real
"Aubameyang, Ozil Star Against Leicester as Arsenal Make it Perfect 10 ","London: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mesut Ozil stole the show as Arsenal swept to their 10th successive win with a dominant 3-1 victory against Leicester on Monday.  Unai Emery's side trailed to Hector Bellerin's first-half own goal at the Emirates Stadium.  But Ozil, captaining Arsenal on his return to the side after back spasms, produced a majestic display to lead the Gunners' impressive fightback.  Ozil, shrugging off his poor start to the season, equalised just before half-time and played a key role in Aubameyang's second-half double.  Gabon striker Aubameyang scored twice in quick succession after coming off the bench, ensuring Arsenal won 10 consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time since 2007.  They have scored 30 goals in that blistering streak and climb to fourth place in the Premier League, just two points behind leaders Manchester City.  On the 69th birthday of Emery's predecessor Arsene Wenger, this was the kind of swashbuckling show that recalled Arsenal's glory days under the Frenchman.  Ozil summed up Arsenal mood, tweeting after the match: ""I think we played some sexy football tonight. Proud captain of this team.""  It was the perfect start to a hectic week that sees Arsenal travel to Portugal for a Europa League tie against Sporting Lisbon on Thursday before returning to domestic action at Crystal Palace on Sunday.  ""We are happy because we are progressing. We need to play with organisation but also we are beginning to play with heart,"" Emery said.  ""Today the performance of the team, and also of Mesut, was very good.""  Emery has made a remarkable impact since replacing Wenger in the close-season.  The Spanish manager's two-game losing streak at the start of his Arsenal reign is now a distant memory as Gunners fans start to dream of a title challenge after their seventh successive league win.  Emery isn't getting carried away just yet, saying: ""It's important to keep calm and progress with every player. To continue winning is difficult.  ""When you improve your demands are very high. We need to control matches more than we are doing now.""  Leicester boss Claude Puel was furious his side didn't get a penalty for a first-half handball by Rob Holding.  ""I am angry about this decision because the good work from my players was not helped,"" he said.  Driving forward  Leicester's spot-kick claim came when Holding raised his arm above his head and clearly handled as he jumped to meet Jamie Vardy's flick-on, yet referee Christopher Kavanagh waved play on.  Harry Maguire's towering header forced a good save from Leno and Leicester's pressure reaped a tangible reward in the 31st minute.  Wilfried Ndidi's pass picked out Ben Chilwell, who made a superb run in behind Bellerin and drilled a low shot that deflected off the Arsenal defender on its way past the wrong-footed Leno.  Stunned into action by that setback, Arsenal nearly snatched an immediate equaliser when Granit Xhaka's free-kick was tipped over by Kasper Schmeichel.  Suddenly, Arsenal were driving forward with purpose and they drew level on the stroke of half-time.  Ozil was the catalyst as his pass sent Bellerin away down the right and when the defender crossed into the Leicester area, it was the German midfielder who timed his run perfectly to guide a delicate finish into the far corner.  Ndidi led the Leicester response with a powerful header that rattled the bar from James Maddison's corner.  But Emery sent on Aubameyang for Lichtsteiner after 61 minutes and the switch paid instant dividends two minutes later.  Ozil played a superb pass to Bellerin and the Spaniard's low cross was just right for the unmarked Aubameyang to slot home from close range.  Aubameyang was in the right place at the right time again in the 66th minute as Arsenal conjured up another incisive raid.  This was Arsenal at their finest as Ozil and Lacazette combined to carve open the Leicester defence in a blur of flicks and tricks, presenting Aubameyang with a simple chance to tap in his eighth goal of the season.",SPORTS,Real
"Cristiano Ronaldo Returns to Old Trafford, Insists He is an 'Example' Amid Rape Allegations ","Cristiano Ronaldo stated Monday he is an ""example"" in his behaviour on and off the field amid allegations of rape made against the five-time Ballon d'Or winner in the United States.  ""I know I am an example, 100 percent, in the pitch and outside the pitch,"" Ronaldo told a press conference ahead of his return to Manchester United, where he spent six years as a player, with Juventus in the Champions League.  A former American model Kathryn Mayorga, 34, has accused Ronaldo of raping her on June 13, 2009 just before he joined Real Madrid from United. Ronaldo strenuously denied the allegations in a statement just over two weeks ago and has been backed by his new club.  ""I am always smiling, I am a happy man, I’m blessed that I play in a fantastic club, I have a fantastic family, I have four kids, I am healthy,"" added Ronaldo.  ""I have everything. So the rest, it doesn’t interfere on me. I’m very, very well.""  In his first press conference since the allegations arose, Ronaldo seemed keen to stress his happiness in his new surroundings in Italy after joining Juve from Madrid for 112 million euros ($128 million) in July.  Off the field, the allegations saw Juventus' share price fall sharply and Ronaldo's personal sponsors Nike and EA Sports express their concern.  However, Ronaldo's form on the pitch hasn't been affected as the Portuguese has scored five goals in his last six Serie A appearances.  ""I’m not going to lie in this situation,"" he added. ""My lawyers they are confident and of course I am too.  ""The most important (thing) is I enjoy the football, I enjoy my life.  ""The rest, I have people who take care of my life. Of course, the truth is always coming in the first position. So, I’m good.""  - Made in Manchester -  Ronaldo made his name in Manchester with United, winning three Premier League titles and the first of his five Champions Leagues.  On his only previous return with Madrid in 2013, Ronaldo received a hero's welcome, but went on to score the winning goal as Real progressed 3-2 on aggregate in a contentious Champions League last 16 tie.  ""To return here to Manchester is a huge emotion. When I saw the draw, I remembered the history I made here,"" he added.  ""I won all the trophies here: Champions League, leagues, cups, I remembered the fans and I remembered one of the people who helped me most, Sir Alex Ferguson.""  Defeat to Madrid five years ago was Ferguson's final European game in charge and since his retirement, United have fallen on hard times.  After short-lived tenures for David Moyes and Louis Van Gaal, United manager Jose Mourinho is now battling to save his job with the Red Devils languishing in 10th in the Premier League.  By contrast, Juventus failed to win for the first time this season in all competitions in a 1-1 draw (Ronaldo scoring) with Genoa on Saturday, but United retain Ronaldo's respect.  ""We have to respect Man United. They are a fantastic team, they have an experienced coach but I expect and hope Juventus will win the game.""",SPORTS,Real
"Bajrang Punia Settles for Silver, Otoguro Becomes Youngest World Champion From Japan ","Budapest: Bajrang Punia's bid to become only the second Indian to win a Gold medal at the World Championship fell flat as a tactically superior Takuto Otoguro of Japan stunned the Indian in the 65kg final, here on Monday.   Only the fourth Indian ever to make it to the World Championship gold medal match, 24-year-old Bajrang was rattled by the 19-year old Otoguro, who consistently attacked the left leg of Indian and emerged a comfortable 16-9 winner.  In the process, Otoguru became Japan's youngest World Champion at the age of 19.  Legendary Yuji Takada, who won gold at 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, had become youngest World Champion from Japan at the age of 20 in 1974.   A four-point throw gave Otoguro an early 5-0 lead, leaving Bajrang to play a catch-up game. With back-to-back take downs, the Indian reduced the deficit to 4-5.  The Japanese got more points with a step out and led 7-6 at the break.  An early take down at the start of second period handed Otoguro a 9-6 lead. The Japanese kept attacking Bajrang's left leg, a strategy which the Indian struggled to counter.   The Commonwealth Games and Asian Games gold medallist Bajrang eventually had to settle for a silver, which is his second medal at the Worlds. He had won a bronze in 2013 edition.  Sushil Kumar, country's greatest ever wrestler, is the lone Indian to win a gold medal at the Worlds, achieving the feat in 2010 in Moscow in the 66kg category.  Apart from Sushil, Amit Dahiya (2013) and Bishambar Singh (1967) are the other Indians to make it to the World Championship final in men's free style.  Udey Chand (bronze, 1961), Ramesh Kumar (bronze, 2009), Narsingh Yadav (2015) are the other men's free style wrestlers to win a medal at the World Championship.  Among female grapplers, only Babita Phogat (bronze, 2012), Geeta Phogat (2012), Alka Tomar (bronze, 2006) are the medal winners at Worlds.

"Ajay Devgn, Luv Ranjan Fire Make-Up Artist After He Makes Assistant Director 'Uncomfortable' ","Harish Wadhone, make-up artist for Bollywood actor Ajay Devgn, has been removed from his duty on the sets of De De Pyaar De after an assistant director, Tanya Paul Singh, accused him of sexual harassment.

She further wrote, ""As an assistant director at the monitor with headphones when the first AD announced roll sound, I felt hands on my shoulder. Since I’m wired and already with a lot of continuity files in my hand, it’s almost impossible to look behind who it was. I could tell it was a man. He began to give me a very strong massage from head to tailbone. The touch did not seem right. In the middle of the shot, I couldn’t say anything. He picked a good time to victimize.”  She continued to tell that Wadhone did not stop even after she expressed her displeasure towards his behaviour. Narrating another incident, she wrote, “He would lean on the chair on the excuse of watching a close-up shot of Ajay Devgn. I felt his fingers on my back again. I informed, rather ordered, one of the interns to stand by my chair and not let anyone lean over to watch the Shogun.

Avengers 4: New Leaked BTS Pictures Show Pepper Potts in Iron Man Rescue Armour ,"Pepper Potts and Tony Stark were separated in Avengers: Infinity War when Iron Man went on to save the Earth and its mightiest heroes. Now, it seems fans will see them reuniting in the upcoming Avengers 4 movie.  Of late, a picture of Iron Man's fiancé, Pepper Potts is making rounds on the internet and is getting shared across fan pages. The picture has Gwyneth Paltrow (the actress who plays Pepper Potts) wearing a motion capture suit. The photo has led fans to assume that she will suit up in an Iron Man Rescue Armour.  Take a look at the picture:    If this picture turns out to be real, we will see Pepper joining the Avengers for the first time. Although, this will not be the first time we see her wearing a superhero suit. In Iron Man 3, when the Mandarin attacked Tony Stark’s Malibu mansion he summoned his armour to save Pepper. This when she donned a suit for a brief time.  After the picture surfaced, a number of fan theories erupted. While some fans assumed that Potts might rescue Iron Man from Titan, others argued that it is not possible because Tony is accompanied by Nebula on Titan with her seemingly intact spacecraft. So there are chances that Iron Man might return to earth with Nebula in her spaceship.  It is being assumed that Avengers 4 is set five years after the events of Infinity War. If that happens then Tony and Pepper might be married and will also have a kid, since the latter was pregnant when the war started.   Also as fans theories of Iron Man being stuck in the Quantum Realm surfaced, Pepper donning the armour could mean larger sacrifices.  Will Pepper join the Avengers and will she reunite with Tony, fans will find out in Avengers 4, the last film of the Avengers Universe.",ENTERTAINMENT,Real
'Somebody Tried to Rape Me': Soni Razdan Shares Her #MeToo Story  ,"Veteran actress Soni Razdan has shared her #MeToo story and said 'somebody tried to rape' her. In an interview with The Quint, she revealed that she considers herself lucky as she hasn't faced sexual harassment when she approached people for work.

While talking to IANS about harassment at workplace she said , ""It is easy to say that if such harassment happens, walk out of your job. But people depend on that job, it is about their livelihood, a question of survival. So while we must encourage victims for coming up with their #MeToo stories, we should not judge women for not sharing their stories.""  Asked why sexual harassment happens at workplace, she said, ""When someone is humiliating and harassing a woman, he must be knowing that the victim is needy and left with no option but to tolerate such harassment to save the job. It is about livelihood.""  The actress, who recently travelled to Busan International Film Festival for her film Yours Truly, said, ""Every company should have zero tolerance on sexual harassment so that victims feel secure while taking a stand.""",ENTERTAINMENT,Real

Tanushree Dutta: Big Stars are Complicit and Uncomfortable Talking About #MeToo ,"The #MeToo movement in India started with the resurfacing of Tanushree Dutta’s ten year old case of sexual harassment. After she narrated her ordeal a number of women came forward to accuse multiple members of the film fraternity. In regard to the same, popular actors like Priyanka Chopra, Farhan Akhtar, Swara Bhaskar and Sonam K Ahuja among others, came forward to take a stand in support for the movement.  On Tuesday, at Aaj Tak Mumbai Manthan 2018, Tanushree said that many big stars have avoided talking about the ongoing #MeToo movement in India because they are complicit or uncomfortable.  While actors like Aamir Khan and Hrithik Roshan have taken a firm stand against the accused, names like Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor among others have been tight-lipped about the ongoing movement.  Talking about the support she received, she said, ""Some people have come forward on social media to provide support; some have taken a stand by not working with the perpetrators. But I am also aware of the encouragement I am receiving.”  She also expressed her disappointment over the treatment of her case in 2008. “They are considering it a controversy, not a revival. You wait for it to pass over - when you consider it a controversy. I was on national TV 10 years ago for three days - I had a lot to lose back then. I was moving to better and bigger projects back then. But I was put in a situation because I was subjected to it. I had to defend myself. I wanted to speak to protect myself from the damages. But the whole thing blew over,” she added.  In August, Tanushree Dutta accused Nana Patekar of alleged sexual harassment on the sets of 2008 film Horn OK Pleassss. She also made allegations against the film’s choreographer Ganesh Acharya, director Rakesh Sarang and producer Samee Siddique, of ganging up against her and witnessing everything mutely and not interfering.",ENTERTAINMENT,Real

According to Bollywood Hungama, Yash Raj Films, which is producing the Vijay Krishna Acharya directorial, has issued a clear mandate to all the film exhibitors that Thugs of Hindostan’s tickets be priced at least 10% more than the cost of the tickets of Rajkumar Hirani’s Sanju (in multiplexes) and Remo D’Souza’s Race 3 (in single screen theatres), two of the highest grossing films of the year.

Kasautii Zindagii Kay: Of CGI Flown Dupattas and Bad TV in the Age of Netflix ,"I was nine when Kasautii Zindagii Kay premiered on national television. Despite being one among the countless Ekta Kapoor shows that had titles starting with K, it nevertheless stood out for me. In my juvenile head, its story of star-crossed lovers gave it the feel of a home-grown Shakespearean romance, different from everything else that aired on TV then. I remember watching it night after night until I could watch it no more.  Today, 17 years later, I have long moved on but Indian TV is stuck in time, more garish and painfully uninspiring than ever.   When Ekta Kapoor first announced Kasautii’s reboot earlier this year, the show’s loyalists (yes, they exist) rejoiced but a lot of us shuddered inwardly. In 2001, a show like Kasautii worked, not because of its great content, but essentially because Indian audiences did not have many options.  However, the world is starkly different today, so is the audience and their sensibilities. 10-minute long slo-mo character introductions and CGI flown ‘dupattas’ may have worked then but today they will be seen for what they are—utterly ridiculous—and will be called out too by the viewers who are largely a generation hard-pressed on time, that speaks its mind, is known for dwindling attention and cannot imagine a day-in without Netflix.    But Ekta Kapoor knows it already. Why do you think she launched her own streaming platform ALT Balaji otherwise? Trying to monetise the untapped potential in the Indian web space, she has been consistently populating it with original shows such as Bose and Home. If she can put out such content on the web, why discriminate against TV then?  It isn’t just Ekta though. Colors TV also has its own web-streaming platform called Voot, which features interesting originals such as Feet Up With The Stars and Stupid Man Smart Phone. Its television shows meanwhile are still lamentably limited to Naagin, which is now in its third season (the horror!) and Bigg Boss, now in its 12th season (says it all).  Interestingly, despite global web-streaming platforms wolfing a large share of the domestic entertainment space, TV still is the most popular source of entertainment in India for it reaches even areas where the internet hasn’t yet. It offers content in regional languages, a versatility which international media service providers are working towards.  But just because a clear divide is now emerging in who watches what, is it fair to feed off it? Make viewers in Jabalpur suffer through the ‘saas bahu aur saazish’ type content on TV while simultaneously aspiring to grab the attention of the metro junta with content-driven web shows?  So dear daily soap creators, here’s a request—use new shiny bottles all you want, but don’t serve rotten old wine. We may not all binge-watch Netflix or live in metro cities, but we can tell. Also, internet will eventually reach the remotest of India much like TV. What then? ​",ENTERTAINMENT,Real
Ayushmann Khurrana: The New Middle Class Hero is Also a Box Office Champion ,"Ayushmann Khurrana’s latest film Badhaai Ho is registering phenomenal business at the box office. The film has collected Rs 51.35 crore in first five days of its release which is a noteworthy achievement considering the fact that it wasn’t the only big release of the week. Arjun Kapoor-Parineeti Chopra starrer Namaste England released on the same day, October 18.  With Badhaai Ho, Ayushmann has delivered his fourth hit in a row – Bareilly Ki Barfi, Shubh Mangal Savdhan and AndhaDhun are the other three.  In fact, AndhaDhun, which released on October 5, is still running in the cinema halls. In a way, it’s Ayushmann versus Ayushmann at the ticket window right now. He has done it for the second time. Earlier, Bareilly Ki Barfi and Shubh Mangal Savdhan released within a span of two weeks.  Overall, this is his sixth commercially successful film out of the ten he has done so far. It’s a fantastic track record provided he has only played the lead roles so far. Never forget, he was the lead in Bareilly Ki Barfi with Rajkummar Rao as his more-than-able deputy.  Ayushmann  Incidentally, the other actor he can be compared with in terms of non-film background and box office success is Rajkummar Rao. With Stree’s super success, he is on his way to become the next superstar for mid-pocket producers. He has done eight films since January, 2017. These films have seen him working with who’s who of Bollywood and still headlining the projects.  He was considered the prime reason behind the success of Bareilly Ki Barfi, Newton and Stree. He has his calendar blocked for many more months and with his growing brand value, he is not likely to look back for some time now.  Read: Badhaai Ho Movie Review Read: AnbdhaDhun Movie Review  Ayushmann’s rate of success is definitely higher than Rajkummar, but that’s also because the latter had to wait for some time to find his feet in the industry. While Ayushmann had a blockbuster opening, Vicky Donor, in Bollywood, Rajkummar worked in a series of films that focused more on art than commerce. Eventually, Kai Po Che and Shahid brought him to limelight. In between 2016-17, Rajkummar proved his versatility and the only thing missing from his repertoire, a solo hit, came with Newton. Stree consolidated his position. He is now an actor who big-budget producers can bank upon.  Ayushmann2  Both, Ayushmann and Rajkummar, are trying to be the quintessential hero middle class is looking for since Amol Palekar past his prime. The tug of war is nicely poised right now and the kind of impressive work these two actors are doing, the audience can only hope for better films.",ENTERTAINMENT,Real

Nicole Kidman Opens Up on Why She Rarely Speaks About Marriage to Tom Cruise at 23 ,"Actor Nicole Kidman recently made headlines when she spoke about how being married to Tom Cruise in her 20s protected her from being sexually abused in the industry.  On Monday, the Academy Award-winning actor appeared on the Today show, wherein she further explained what she had meant about being ""protected"".  ""I was married at 23 years old, I wasn't going to parties or I wasn't going out a lot. I was pretty much at home. I had my first child at 25 and I was a married — I was in a family. So my sense of being in the world was — I was working, or I was at home,"" she said.  She continued: “I think when you’re married to a very powerful man, I mean, I’m not in a male’s mind but... when I said ‘protection,’ I think there’s almost like a barrier a lot of women don’t have — that a lot of people in the world don’t have.”  In an interview with New York magazine for its Women and Power series, Kidman had talked about how her the then-husband Cruise's star status shielded her from all kinds of abuse in Hollywood.  “I got married very young, but it definitely wasn’t power for me — it was protection. I married for love, but being married to an extremely powerful man kept me from being sexually harassed. I would work, but I was still very much cocooned. So when I came out of it at 32, 33, it’s almost like I had to grow up,"" she had said.  Kidman and Cruise were married on December 24 in 1990 after meeting on the set of action film Days of Thunder in 1989.  The pair were married for over 10 years and adopted two children: Isabella Jane and Connor Antony. Cruise filed for divorce from her in 2001.  Kidman tied the knot with Urban in 2006. They have two daughters together: Sunday Rose, 10, and Faith Margaret, 7.  ",ENTERTAINMENT,Real

Exhibition in Brussels Displays Indian Atrocities in Kashmir ,"By Sajjad Shaukat  One the one side, Indian atrocities continues unabated in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) against the innocent Kashmiris who are demanding their genuine right of liberation, while, on the other side, Kashmiris are continuously protesting against the brutal tactics of the Indian forces.  In this regard, an exhibition of photographs from Indian Held Kashmir (IHK) was inaugurated at European Press Club in Brussels on November 7, this year. The exhibition is part of the 11th Kashmir-EU Week taking place in Brussels from 5th to 8th of November and will continue at the Press Club Brussels, Europe for two weeks.  Prime Minister Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Raja Farooq Haider Khan, who is participating in the week long program “Kashmir EU Week”, opened the exhibition organised by Kashmir Council Europe (KC-EU).  The photographs of the famous French-Belg photographer Mr Cédric Gerbehaye which were also featured in National Geographic magazine in June 2018 along with a story on Kashmir by Rania Abouzeid have been displayed in the exhibition.  The photographs tell-how are the miseries of the young people—the women and old people as well as misuse of brutal force by the Indian forces in the occupied valley and how they struggle for freedom in a brutal environment and a severe pressure by the Indian occupation forces.  In this respect, the intense rage against New Delhi which is growing among young people due to suppression and the brutal use of force by Indian security forces are particularly depicted by Gerbehaye.  Notably, a similar exhibition of his photographs will also take place in European Parliament Strasbourg from 13th November.  In fact, Gerbehaye visited the IOK in the wake of a new wave of protests by the people of the occupied valley and he has seen brutal use of force by Indian Army in the aftermath the incident of martyrdom of Burahan Wani in July 2016.  It is of particular attention that the use of chemical weapons and pellet guns by Indian security forces paralyzed hundreds of Kashmiris—throwing lead balls on the eyes of crowd resulted in the death and total blindness of many demonstrators.  However, besides the photographs by Cedric Gerbehaye, an exhibition of Kashmiri arts and crafts was also organized at the press club besides the photographs by Cedric Gerbehaye.  On the occasion, Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider said, “This exhibition will help in understanding the hardships of the people of occupied Kashmir. Kashmiris are suffering from Indian brutalities for last seven decades. Problem of Kashmir is on the agenda on United Nation (UN) for a long time but the issue has not been resolved so far according to the wishes of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.”  He further stated, “By removing 35A India wants to make demographic change in occupied Kashmir, but we shall not allow New Delhi to do it.” He added, Indian forces at Line of Control (LoC) are also involved in the killing of innocent people of Azad Kashmir living near the LoC.”  Prime Minister Farooq Haider Khan hailed the recent UN’s human rights council report and a document of EU parliament’s research center regarding human rights violations in IHK. About Kashmir EU, he said, “Annual program of Kashmir EU-Week promoted the Kashmir cause. All the Kashmir should unitedly support this cause.”  Chairman Kashmir Council EU Ali Raza Syed and Chairman Kashmir Global Council Farooq Saddique also addressed the opening session of the exhibition.  Ali Raza Syed said, “As photograph always gives an important message, these photos show to the world the severe psychological trauma among the people of Kashmir. There is no treatment for such pain; it is necessary to help to bring them out of the trauma…the photos will inspire the humanity and create a compassion in the world toward the oppressed people of Jammu and Kashmir.”  Chairman Kashmir Council-EU further said, “As a photographer Mr Cédric Gerbehaye conveyed an emotive and painful story of the innocent people of Jammu and Kashmir through his pictures.”  He added, “Unfortunately violence and human rights violations in India-held Kashmir are rapidly increasing. Lack of freedom of speech and restriction on peaceful protest has become everyday matter in the occupied territory.”  Chairman Kashmir Global Council Mr Farooq Sadiqui stated, “We have pledged to continue our struggle till achievement of inalienable right to self-determination of the people of Kashmir…We will continue to make the international community aware of the atrocities in occupied Kashmir and the facts about the severe situation related to human rights in Kashmir. He added, “We want to uncover real and ruthless face of India.”  It is mentionable that since 1947, in order to maintain its illegal control, India has continued its repressive regime in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) through various machinations.  In this connection, various forms of state terrorism have been part of a deliberate campaign by the Indian army and paramilitary forces against the Muslim Kashmiris, especially since 1989. It has been manifested in brutal tactics like crackdowns, curfews, illegal detentions, massacre, targeted killings, sieges, burning the houses, torture, disappearances, rape, breaking the legs, molestation of Muslim women and killing of persons through fake encounter.  According to a report on human rights violations in the Indian Occupied Kashmir, since 1989, there have been deaths of 1,00000 innocent Kashmiris, 7,023 custodial killings, 1,22,771 arrests, 1,05,996 destruction of houses or buildings, 22,776 women widowed, 1,07,466 children orphaned and 10,086 women gang-raped/molested. Indian brutal securities forces have continue these atrocities. Now, the figures have increases, as India state terrorism has continued unabated.  As a matter of fact, Indian forces have employed various draconian laws like the Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act, and the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act and Public Safety Act in killing the Kashmiri people, and for the arbitrarily arrest of any individual for an indefinite period.  Besides Human Rights Watch, in its various reports, Amnesty International has also pointed out grave human rights violations in the Indian controlled Kashmir, indicating, “The Muslim majority population in the Kashmir Valley suffers from the repressive tactics of the security forces.”  In its report on July 2, 2015, the Amnesty International has highlighted extrajudicial killings of the innocent persons at the hands of Indian security forces in the Indian Held Kashmir. The report points out, “Tens of thousands of security forces are deployed in Indian-administered Kashmir…the Armed Forces Special Powers Act allows troops to shoot to kill suspected militants or arrest them without a warrant…not a single member of the armed forces has been tried in a civilian court for violating human rights in Kashmir…this lack of accountability has in turn facilitated other serious abuses…India has martyred one 100,000 people. More than 8,000 disappeared (while) in the custody of army and state police.”  In this respect, European Union has passed a resolution about human rights abuses committed by Indian forces in the Indian held Kashmir.  It is also of particular attention that in 2008, a rights group reported unmarked graves in 55 villages across the northern regions of the Indian-held Kashmir. Then researchers and other groups reported finding thousands of mass graves without markers. In this respect, in August, 2011, Indian Jammu and Kashmir State Human Rights Commission officially acknowledged in its report that innocent civilians killed in the two-decade conflict have been buried in unmarked graves.  Particularly, foreign sources and human rights organisations have revealed that unnamed graves include those innocent persons, killed by the Indian military and paramilitary troops in the fake encounters including those who were tortured to death by the Indian secret agency RAW. In the recent past, more unmarked graves have been discovered.  It is noteworthy that report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released on June 14, 2018-“Situation in Kashmir” pointed out Indian atrocities in the IOK. It said: “From July 2016, the High Commissioner for Human Rights has on numerous occasions requested the Governments of India and Pakistan that his Office be given unconditional access to Kashmir to assess the human rights situation. India rejected this request; while Pakistan offered access…The refusal to allow unhindered access to United Nations team into Indian-Administered-Kashmir gave rise to an idea of “Remote Monitoring”. The report was then compiled by doing “remote monitoring” on the situation of Human Rights in Kashmir. The report by the independent authority is an eye-opener for many. The focus of the report is on the situation of human rights in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir from July 2016 to April 2018. During this period ‘OHCHR’ received reports of allegations of widespread and serious human rights violations by Indian security forces that led to numerous civilian casualties.  It is worth-mentioning that in his address at the 73rd United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 29, this year, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said, “The neighbouring country [India] rejected the Pakistani offer of resuming peace talks on ‘flimsy grounds…We are ready to talk to India on all issues but with respect…Kashmir issue is the biggest obstacle to regional peace…the Indian forces subjecting Kashmiris to atrocities for seven decades. India should not test Pakistan’s patience…we will respond to Indian aggression…The latest UN report on the occupied Kashmir has exposed Indian atrocities on innocent civilians…the meeting between the Pakistani and Indian foreign ministers would’ve been a great opportunity for dialogue. But, the Modi government chose politics over dialogue…India would have to bear the brunt of Pakistan’s retaliation if it makes the mistake of any misadventure on the Line of Control (LoC)”.  It seems that Indian authorities are not willing to talk with Kashmiri people on political grounds. New Delhi reached to a conclusion that only bullet is the right way of dealing with Kashmiris, demanding their right of self-determination. Surprisingly, Indian successive governments are trying to ignore the dynamics of the freedom movement of Kashmiris for the sake of their alien rule.  Nonetheless, Kashmir Council EU (KC-EU) launched the 11th annual week-long event of “Kashmir EU-Week” at European Parliament in Brussels. Especially, the exhibition displays Indian atrocities in the Indian controlled Kashmir.",INDIA,Fake

Why India Accelerated Ceasefire Violations Along the Loc? ,"By Sajjad Shaukat  On the one hand, India has accelerated ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC), but, on the other hand, it is accusing Pakistan for the same by following the threatening diplomacy.  In this regard, Indian media, including “The Times of India”  allegedly reported on October 1, this year: “In what will be read as a signal to the new government of Imran Khan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday [September 30] warned that the Indian Army will respond firmly to any ceasefire violation by Pakistan and other provocative actions intended to disturb peace and spark violence…our soldiers will give a befitting reply to whosoever makes an attempt to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our nation. The PM’s remarks on the officially promoted second anniversary of surgical strikes on terror launch pads in Pakistan-Kashmir and in the backdrop of India’s decision to cancel a meeting between Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers can indicate recourse to a tougher or more proactive response to violence along the LoC. The Modi government has followed a policy of heavy retaliatory firing on the LoC and the IB [International Border] in J&K [Jammu & Kashmir]”.  Hindustan Time wrote on September 30, 2018: “A day after a special police officer (SPO) attached with legislator from Wachi, Ajaz Mir, decamped with seven rifles and one pistol from the official residence of the legislator at high security zone Jawhar Nagar, the J&K director general of police (DGP) said that the SPO was in touch with the militants…We have found that the SPO had joined the other side (militants)…Police will take action against all those found involved in dereliction of their duties.”  It is mentionable that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s extremist party-BJP had got a land sliding triumph in the Indian elections 2014 on the basis of anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan slogans. Therefore, since the Prime Minister Modi came to power, he has been implementing anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan agenda with the support of fanatic coalition outfits. Now, same slogans-based policy has become the BJP strategy to win the Indian general elections 2019.  In this context, in her speech at the 73rd United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s had slammed Pakistan on September 29, this year by raising false allegations of infiltration in the Indian Controlled Kashmir and of harbouring terrorists.  Reacting strongly to Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s verbal attack on Pakistan, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on September 29, 2018 said in his address at UNGA: “The neighbouring country rejected the Pakistani offer of resuming peace talks on ‘flimsy grounds…India is exporting terrorism to Pakistan and other countries in the region. Kulbhushan Jadhav is an example of India exporting terrorism to its neighbouring countries.”  Qureshi, maintained that Pakistan wanted ties with India based on mutual respect by adding: “We are ready to talk to India on all issues but with respect…Kashmir issue is the biggest obstacle to regional peace…the Indian forces subjecting Kashmiris to atrocities for seven decades. India should not test Pakistan’s patience…we will respond to Indian aggression…The latest UN report on the occupied Kashmir has exposed Indian atrocities on innocent civilians…the meeting between the Pakistani and Indian foreign ministers would’ve been a great opportunity for dialogue. But, the Modi government chose politics over dialogue…India would have to bear the brunt of Pakistan’s retaliation if it makes the mistake of any misadventure on the Line of Control (LoC)”.  Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s address has “disappointed” Congress leader Shashi Tharoor who feels that all the Pakistan bashing in New York was aimed at the BJP voters. His other objection to her speech on Saturday [September 29] was that it did not portray India in a good light.  It is mentionable that report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released on June 14, 2018-“Situation in Kashmir” is pointed out Indian atrocities in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK). It said: “From July 2016, the High Commissioner for Human Rights has on numerous occasions requested the Governments of India and Pakistan that his Office be given unconditional access to Kashmir to assess the human rights situation. India rejected this request; while Pakistan offered access…The refusal to allow unhindered access to United Nations team into Indian-Administered-Kashmir gave rise to an idea of “Remote Monitoring”. The report was then compiled by doing “remote monitoring” on the situation of Human Rights in Kashmir. The report by the independent authority is an eye-opener for many. The focus of the report is on the situation of human rights in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir from July 2016 to April 2018. During this period ‘OHCHR’ received reports of allegations of widespread and serious human rights violations by Indian security forces that led to numerous civilian casualties.  Nevertheless Kashmir has become Achilles Heels for India. Since the publishing of the United Nations Human Rights on “Situation in Kashmir”, Indian frustration has increased manifolds. India attempted to ventilate the frustration by hollow claims and usual allegations against Pakistan as noted at UNGA’s recent session. On the contrary, Islamabad used a decent and mature posture to project the sufferings and struggle of innocent Kashmiri people against unlawful occupation of IOK. Pakistan’s mature stance has even attracted appreciation of Indian external affairs expert like Shashi Tharoor who censured speech of India’s External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj.  Failing to get acknowledgement in UNGA, New Delhi has started accusing Pakistan for failure in resumption of dialogue. On the contrary, it was India which avoided resuming dialogue on petty pretexts.  It is mentionable that Indian Army Chief Bipin Rawat on September 22, this year threatened Pakistan with retaliation over its alleged involvement in killing of a border guard and policemen in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK).  Indian electronic media quoted Gen, Rawat as saying: “We need to take stern action to avenge the barbarism that terrorists and Pakistan Army have been carrying out”, and threatened “surprise attack [surgical strike] on Pakistan…teaching Pakistan a lesson.”  The remarks come a day after New Delhi called off a meeting scheduled for talks between the foreign ministers of Pakistan and India.  On the same day, reacting to the Indian army chief’s threat and reckless remarks, the Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor advised “India not to get into war-mongering as a ruse to deflect international challenges…Pakistan is a nuclear nation and is ready to give a befitting reply to any misadventure…Pakistan’s desire for peace should not be taken for weakness…Pakistan is a peace loving country and has played an unparalleled role as forces of peace in the region.”  Warning India of stern military repercussions and urging Indian army chief to abstain from deteriorating peace situation, Maj. Gen. Ghafoor added: “War is never a solution to any problem. Pakistan has always positively responded to all peace initiatives. It’s India who backs out from the dialogue…Indian army has been indulged in its country’s politics in the wake of corruption scandals…the Indian government is under criticism internally from the opposition on various corruption scams and failure of economic agenda. Such statements are attempts to divert domestic narrative towards Pakistan…India is trying to divert attention from the domestic problem and is resorting to baseless propaganda…No Pakistani troop was involved in the mutilation of an Indian soldier.”  Regarding Indian ceasefire violations across the LoC, in the recent past, the DG of ISPR said, “Indian army started unprovoked firing along the LoC in different sectors, targeting civilian populations. Pakistan army troops responded effectively to Indian ceasefire violations and targeted those posts which [had] initiated unprovoked firing.”  Similarly, Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal stated that so far “in 2018, Indian forces carried out more than 150 ceasefire violations along the LoC and the Working Boundary in just 20 days, resulting in the death of nine innocent civilians. In 2017, more than 1,300 Indian ceasefire violations, the highest ever in the recent past, have resulted in 52 deaths…and 175 were injured…The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation.” The FO spokesperson urged India to “respect the 2003 ceasefire arrangement.  He added, “The Indian side should permit the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan [UNMOGIP] to play its mandated role as per the UN Security Council resolutions…Ceasefire violations are a frequent feature along the LoC and Working Boundary despite the leadership of Pakistan Rangers and India’s Border Security Forces agreeing in November 2017 that the spirit of a 2003 ceasefire agreement must be revived to protect innocent lives.”  Surprisingly, on September 24, 2018, Indian Army Chief Rawat again threatened Pakistan by saying that I “want another surgical strike’ on terror launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC)…time is ripe for such action…But I will not disclose how we intend to go about it.”  On the other side, talking to media in London on October 13, this year, DG of ISPR, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor stated: “Pakistan will launch 10 times, if India launches one surgical strike”.  It is noteworthy that a leading newspaper of Pakistan wrote on September 30, 2018: “The current hardening of position by the government of India is directly linked to its general elections which are due early next year. The ruling BJP cannot afford to be seen soft on “terror”— a frightening bogey which has been created and which in India is now synonymous with Pakistan…This intransigence and refusal to engage and talk has not only held the people of Kashmir hostage, but by placing the region on the dangerous trajectory that it is currently moving on, it is a threat to the people of both the countries. Kashmir stands as a potential nuclear flashpoint between them which will consume the lives of millions of people in an instant.”  Nonetheless, as per instructions of the Prime Minister Modi, Indian forces have accelerated ceasefire violations along the LoC, as Modi wants to divert the attention of Indians from the domestic problems and scandals such as corruption etc. Another major purpose of the BJP-led government is to malign Pakistan and its security agencies by creating war-hysteria inside India to win the forthcoming elections.

India-The Most Opportunist Ally of Russia and the US ,"Machiavelli advises the rulers to have a lion-like image outwardly, and act upon the traits of goat inwardly. In his sense, a good ruler should be a good opportunist and hypocrite. While echoing Machiavelli, Morgenthau points out that sometimes, rulers act upon immoral activities like deceit, fraud and falsehood to fulfill their selfish aims. In one way or the other, these political philosophers also favour double game as part of shrewd diplomacy. But, India is openly acting upon the discarded theories of the past political thinkers in the modern era, which have proved that India is the most opportunist ally of Russia and the Unites States.  In this regard, during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s two-day visit to India, Russian President Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who also took part in the Russian-Indian Business Forum and apart from other agreements,  signed on October 5, this year the $5 billion S-400 air defence system deal amid a threat of sanctions from the US.  Prime Minister Modi said in a joint address with Putin, “Russia has stood by India through time and has played a crucial role in India’s growth story…Russia has been an important supplier of defence hardware to India for decades.”  However, the S-400 is one of the world’s most advanced long-range air defence systems. China was the first nation to buy the S-400 missile system in 2014.  The US has hinted at tough sanctions against any nation that buys advanced military hardware from Russia. Under a new law-Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)—the US imposes sanctions on any country that has significant transactions with Iran, North Korea or Russia.  India had already indicated that it will go ahead with the purchase of S-400 deal notwithstanding the US sanctions. In this regard, Indian Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa has told media, “As and when the government approves it, delivery (of the missiles) will be in 24 months.”  Ignoring America’s sanctions over S-400 deal, Indian Army Chief Bipin Rawat said: “India follows independent policy”  When President Putin reached New Delhi, a propaganda campaign had started against Pakistan by the Indian media. In this respect, under the caption, “Putin arrives in India today, Pak terror, S-400 missile deal on agenda”, India Today wrote on October 4, 2018: “Besides the missile deal, Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss the issue of security challenges in the AfPak (Afghanistan-Pakistan) region and the threat of terrorism that emanates from Pakistan. The Modi administration has been engaged with Russia regarding the defence cooperation between Moscow and Islamabad and why is there a need to have such cooperation.”  Press Trust of India revealed on October 3, 2018: “India and Russia will hold a joint military exercise from November 18 to 28 [2018] in Uttar Pradesh, Russian authorities said Wednesday [October 3], ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi. The exercise–Indra-2018–will see participation of about 250 servicemen of motorised infantry units of Russia’s Eastern Military District (EMD), according to a statement by the EMD.”  Under the title, “Can India control Pak’s airspace with Russian S-400 missile defence systems? EurAsia Times wrote on October 4, this year: “India is fully prepared to buy the S-400 Missile Defense Systems from Russia…despite continued US pressure and persistence? Secondly what impact will the S-400 systems create on arch-rivals Pakistan?…In response to this question, a senior defence expert said “It is very worrisome for Pakistan. After the S-400 arrives, India can literally control the airspace of Pakistan, especially the bordering regions. The defence expert also stated that India started to procure weapons from the United States, and in response, defence relations between Pakistan and Russia gradually started to grow. India feared that Pakistan would also demand S-400 from Russia”.  As India is increasing her bonhomie with US, the pinned expectations with the visit of the President Putin was exaggerated in the backdrop that American President Trump had last month signed an executive order, paving the way for slapping crippling sanctions on countries and foreign entities and individuals violating the CAATSA.  In the same background, Indian agreement with Moscow for purchase of the latest defence equipment seems unrealistic and a political ploy of Modi’s government which shows that India is an opportunist ally.  Earlier to the visit of President Putin, some segments of the Indian media have also pointed out that Indian leadership might raise issue of Russia’s Pak approach.  It is notable that the signing of Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) between India and the USA was a watershed moment in defense cooperation between the two countries. The agreement approves the two militaries to share each other’s base for various operations including joint exercise, joint training, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts. The pact enhanced India’s military capability and now India can have access to America’s network of military bases having strategic locations.  In fact, extremist government of Modi is deceiving both the rival countries-Russia and the US by following strategy of fundamentalist Hindus-Chanakya (Say something else and do something else).  While indicating Indo-Russia relations, even some Indian media reports, including those of the Western countries have said that these ties exposed the “Indian duplicitous role”/ditching Russia by citing LEMOA/other agreements with the US and undue preferences for the US.  Regarding the Russia-India defence deal, Indian “The Economic Times” wrote on October 8, 2018: “S-400 deal gives U.S. a unique chance to spell out special relations with India…India’s decision to purchase the S-400 Triumf missile defence system from Russia has handed the US a unique strategic opportunity to distinguish India from China on their dealings with Russia: sanctions for Beijing, waiver for New Delhi. But will the US make this call? Already, some Washington lobbyists are pitching an even-handed application of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Sanctions were imposed on Chinese entities only last month for the S-400 deal. So how can US President Donald Trump make an exception for exactly the same ‘offence’ even if he has the authority to grant a waiver?”  Analysts opined that in the backdrop of growing Indo-US bonhomie and LEMOA etc, perception about India becoming a “Client State of US” was solidifying. Moreover, under the same syndrome, India was also drifting away from the Cold War ally Russia. As New Delhi is part of few regional and international alliances, having a strong Russian role, she badly needed to neutralize the perception with some activity to prove her independent status. In the same background, India re-engaged Russia by signing multi-billion dollar deal of S-400 surface-to-air missile system.  Apparently, there is no immediate response from the USA over Indo-Russia deal; however, the analysts feel that “American annoyance will be unleashed under “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)” to test India”.  As a matter of fact, India-US friendship is based upon mutual deceptions, as India is uncomfortable with America and the Americans are feeling that Indians are unreliable as partners.  It is mentionable that prior to Putin’s trip to India, the US on October 2, 2018 urged New Delhi to forgo its proposed deal to buy the S-400 missile defence system from Moscow, warning that the deal could attract American sanctions.  President Donald Trump has the power to waive these sanctions for specific countries and specific transactions, and US officials have repeatedly stated in the recent past that India should not expect an automatic waiver if it goes ahead with the purchase from Russia.  In this context, a State Department spokesperson told newspaper, “The Hindu” that this waiver might not be available to India and the S-400 deal falls in the category of sanctionable transactions…We urge all of our allies and partners to forgo transactions with Russia that would trigger sanctions under CAATSA. The Administration has indicated that a focus area for the implementation of CAATSA Section 231 is new or qualitative upgrades in capabilit–including the S-400 air and missile defense system…recently India has ordered defence equipment worth $18 billion from the US”.  Notably, during the Cold War era, India joined the Russian block and extracted maximum benefits from the former Soviet Union. But, after the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, gradually, New Delhi left the former Russia and started strengthening her relations with the US which emerged as the sole superpower. The main aim behind was also to extract maximum benefits from America.  It is of particular attention that during his first visit to New Delhi, on November 6, 2010. President Barack Obama announced the measures, America would take regarding removal of Indian space and defence companies from a restricted “entities list”, and supported Indian demand membership of four key global nuclear nonproliferation regimes.  And as part of the double standards in relation to India and Pakistan, America set aside the Indian poor record regarding the safety of nuclear weapons and related materials. Despite, Indian violations of various international agreements and its refusal to sign Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and Additional Protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Washington signed a pact of nuclear civil technology with New Delhi in 2008. During American President Barack Obama’s visit to India, on January 25, 2016, the US and India announced a breakthrough on the pact which would allow American companies to supply New Delhi with civilian nuclear technology.  Especially, America is a potential military supplier to India. US also pressurized IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to grant a waiver to New Delhi for obtaining civil nuclear trade on larger scale.  In the pretext of countering China, Washington has continued favouring India’s programme of advancement and modernization of nuclear weapons. America supports Indian nuclear programme as part of anti-China and anti-Pakistan approach. Beijing is apprehensive about the emerging threat, as during the last visit of Obama to New Delhi, the intent of President Obama and Indian Prime Minister Modi was quite clear, while mentioning about free sea lanes and air passages in the South China Sea. President Trump is also pursuing the policy of his predecessor in this respect, as in the recent past, during his meeting with Prime Minister Modi, he showed similar approach.",INDIA,Fake

"Pak-India Border Tension Deepens, Danger of Nuclear War ","Indian Army Chief Bipin Rawat on September 22, this year threatened Pakistan with retaliation over its alleged involvement in killing of a border guard and policemen in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK).  Indian electronic media quoted Gen, Rawat as saying: “We need to take stern action to avenge the barbarism that terrorists and Pakistan Army have been carrying out”, and threatened “surprise attack [surgical strike] on Pakistan…teaching Pakistan a lesson.”  The remarks come a day after New Delhi called off a meeting scheduled for talks between the foreign ministers of Pakistan and India.  On the same day, reacting to the Indian army chief’s threat and reckless remarks, the Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Asif Ghafoor advised “India not to get into war-mongering as a ruse to deflect international challenges…Pakistan is a nuclear nation and is ready to give a befitting reply to any misadventure…Pakistan’s desire for peace should not be taken for weakness…Pakistan is a peace loving country and has played an unparalleled role as forces of peace in the region.”  Warning India of stern military repercussions and urging Indian army chief to abstain from deteriorating peace situation, Gen. Ghafoor added: “War is never a solution to any problem. Pakistan has always positively responded to all peace initiatives. It’s India who backs out from the dialogue…Indian army has been indulged in its country’s politics in the wake of corruption scandals…the Indian government is under criticism internally from the opposition on various corruption scams and failure of economic agenda. Such statements are attempts to divert domestic narrative towards Pakistan…India is trying to divert attention from the domestic problem and is resorting to baseless propaganda…No Pakistani troop was involved in the mutilation of an Indian soldier.”  Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry also expressed almost similar feelings and gave a matching response to the Indian army chief’s threat.  As a matter of fact, New Delhi seems to be totally perplexed that compels her to stage dramas such like events-this time a fictional and illusory story of beheading of an India soldier followed by beheading of Pakistani soldiers that are not showcased. In a television interview, Defence Minister of India Nirmala Sitharaman said that the security forces are giving befitting replies to the Pakistani soldiers across the border. She added that the Army is cutting off several heads of the Pakistani soldiers in retaliation to the beheading of one Indian soldier. Such concocted stories are framed by most of the Indian top brass, including media persons. This statement was later towed by the Indian Army Chief Bipin Rawat, as already mentioned.  Surprisingly, on September 24, 2018, Indian Army Chief Rawat again threatened Pakistan by saying that I “want another surgical strike’ on terror launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC)…time is ripe for such action…But I will not disclose how we intend to go about it.”  In fact, there many reasons of Pak-India border tensions which have deepened due to irresponsible policies of New Delhi.  In this respect, in the recent past, visit of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to New Delhi proved inconclusive, as there were many sticks this time in the shape of Indian defense deal (to buy the Russian S-400 missile defense system) with Russia and India’s initiatives with Iran i.e. energy sector deals and Chabahar Port. The US has imposed economic sanctions on Russia and Iran, while American President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that Washington would impose sanctions on any country which concludes agreements with these countries.     It is of particular attention that Russian President Vladimir Putin reached India on Thursday (October 4, 2018). Indian media reported that during his visit, Moscow and New Delhi signed on Friday (October 5, 2018) the $5 billion S-400 air defence system deal and India could face American sanctions.  Earlier, during Pompeo’s visit to Islamabad, the US and Pakistan vowed to review their strained relations positively. In this regard, during his recent trip to the United States, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi met American top officials, including President Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Especially, Quereshi’s meeting with Pompeo was very successful. Both the leaders reiterated Pakistan’s support for a political settlement in Afghanistan, noting that the use of force had failed to deliver results. They agreed that the time was ripe for the Afghan Taliban to avail the opportunity for a political settlement by seizing the opportunity for dialogue. They stressed that peace in South Asia, which was a common goal of both the US and Pakistan, would remain elusive until all disputes, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir, are resolved. Welcoming Pakistan’s foreign minister to the State Department, Secretary Pompeo said: “the United States looked forward to working with the new government of Pakistan in implementing its reform agenda.” The two leaders agreed to remain engaged with a view to achieving their shared bilateral and regional objectives. However, these developments irritated India.  It is notable that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s extremist party-BJP had got a land sliding triumph in the Indian elections 2014 on the basis of anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan slogans. Therefore, since the Prime Minister Modi came to power, he has been implementing anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan agenda with the support of fanatic coalition outfits.  Now, same slogans-based policy has become the BJP strategy to win the Indian general elections 2019. That is why; firing by the Indian Army and Border Security Force (BSF) across the LoC has been accelerated, targeting the innocent civilians and their property in Pakistani side of Kashmir and Working Boundary. Hence, border tension has deepened between Pakistan and India. New Delhi has ignored that fact that both the countries are nuclear powers. So, LoC tension needs appropriate analysis, as it has raised the question, does India wants atomic war?  In this connection, in a recent statement, the ISPR spokesman said, “Indian army started unprovoked firing along the LoC in different sectors, targeting civilian populations. Pakistan army troops responded effectively to Indian ceasefire violations and targeted those posts which [had] initiated unprovoked firing.”  Similarly, Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal stated that Pakistan had summoned the acting Indian deputy high commissioner to lodge a protest over the killing of civilians in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.  He elaborated that so far “in 2018, Indian forces carried out more than 150 ceasefire violations along the LoC and the Working Boundary in just 20 days, resulting in the death of nine innocent civilians. In 2017, more than 1,300 Indian ceasefire violations, the highest ever in the recent past, have resulted in 52 deaths…and 175 were injured…The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation.” The FO spokesperson urged India to “respect the 2003 ceasefire arrangement.  He added, “The Indian side should permit the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan [UNMOGIP] to play its mandated role as per the UN Security Council resolutions…Ceasefire violations are a frequent feature along the LoC and Working Boundary despite the leadership of Pakistan Rangers and India’s Border Security Forces agreeing in November 2017 that the spirit of a 2003 ceasefire agreement must be revived to protect innocent lives.”  Regarding tension at the LoC, Times of India wrote on February 6, 2018, “In the absence of any diplomatic detente, the deadly war of attrition between India and Pakistan along the 778-km Line of Control (LoC) and 198-km International Boundary (IB) in Jammu & Kashmir has taken a sharp turn.”  Nevertheless, border tension along the LoC cannot be seen in isolation, as it is part of interrelated developments which may lead to atomic war between Pakistan and India.  Since July 8, 2016, Indian security forces have martyred more than 700 innocent persons in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK), who have been protesting against the martyrdom of the young Kashmir leader Burhan Wani and for liberation of their land. Kashmiri freedom fighters are demanding their legitimate right of self-determination, as recognized by the UN resolutions. They have accelerated their legitimate struggle in the aftermath of the martyrdom of Burhan Wani in wake of sieges and prolonged curfews, including arrests and detentions of the Kashmir leaders.  Meanwhile, on Setember18, 2016, India staged the drama of the terror attack in the Indian Held Kashmir (IHK) at a military base in Uri, close to the LoC with Pakistan. By manipulating the false flag terror assault, the BJP-led Indian Prime Minister Modi also intensified war-hysteria against Pakistan and instructed Indian forces to continue shelling across the LoC.  Notably, Islamabad also exposed the myth of Indian surgical strikes inside Azad Kashmir, which also depressed New Delhi.  Notably, New Delhi’s main aim is to deflect the attention of the international community from the new phase of Kashmiri Intifada, while pressure has been mounting on the Modi government both domestically and internationally to resolve the issue of Kashmir with Pakistan.  India which has strategic partnership with Israel and America has perennially been manipulating the double game of the US-led West regarding world phenomena of terrorism in connection with Pakistan and Afghanistan, while exploiting their anti-Muslim approach to obtain Indo-Israeli-American clandestine designs.  Emboldened by the fanatic President Trump, India has continued shelling in Pakistani side of Kashmir which remains a nuclear flashpoint between both the neighbouring countries.  It is mentionable that BJP leader Dr. Subramaniam Swami stated on July 12, 2014 that India needed only two years to defeat Pakistan militarily, and the only solution of Kashmir was war, as “there is no peaceful, democratic solution.” Responding to the withdrawal of the US-led NATO forces from Afghanistan, he remarked, “Americans will hand over Afghanistan to Taliban and go…India should send at least 200,000 troops to Afghanistan.”  Nonetheless, it is wishful thinking of the BJP leader that India can defeat Pakistan. While, both the adversaries are nuclear powers, New Delhi has been ignoring the principles of deterrence, popularly known as balance of terror.",INDIA,Fake

Modi’s New Gimmick of Gagging Political Opponents for the Upcoming Elections ,"Recently, the government led by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leader of the extremist ruling party-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unleashed wave of oppressive measures against liberals, Dalit activists, journalists and lawyers who were critical of government policies. These measures, including some other ones are part of the pre-election strategy to be held in 2019.  In Maharashtra, advocate Surendra Gadling, English professor Shoma Sen, writer Sudhir Dhawale, forest rights activist Mahesh Raut and prisoners rights activist Rona Wilson were arrested during June, this year whereas, Sudha Bharadwaj, Gautam Navlakha, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira and Varavara Rao; as well as co-ordinated raids on the residences of Father Stan Swamy, Susan Abraham, and Anand Teltumbde were made during August, this year.  All have been arrested under fabricated allegations which include association with “Urban Maoist network”, fomenting enmity between communities through “Bhima Koregaon violence” and conspiring to murder Prime Minister Modi.  Such moves are part of BJP’s 2019 poll strategy to gag the dissenting voice with state power. Some impartial analysts believe that the current specter being created of a vast and ever-expanding ‘urban Maoist’ network, through an active collaboration between the police and some television channels, are like a ‘fast forward’ to fascism.  Indian intelligentsia feels that the aim is to silence those who have raised their voice against the abuse of state power and to warn others against opening their mouths.  They opined that the police raids on the homes and offices of lawyers, trade unionists, writers and rights activist to project the so-called democratic India is turning into a fascist and autocratic government, India under Modi.  Legal fraternity people like retired Justice of Indian Supreme Court Mr. Katju said that the perpetrators of crime have violated Article 21 of the constitution, which guarantees the fundamental rights to an individual. He elaborated that fake encounters by the police are well-known and widely believed to be done on behest of their political masters. He also criticized the arrests made under false attributions.  It is notable that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s extremist party-BJP had got a land sliding triumph in the Indian elections 2014 on the basis of anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan slogans. Therefore, since the Prime Minister Modi came to power, he has been implementing anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan agenda with the support of fanatic coalition outfits.  Now, same slogans-based policy has become the BJP strategy to win the Indian general elections 2019. In this regard, BJP leadership seems to have geared up its activity for forthcoming poll-2019. Party’s chief strategist Amit Shah is deliberately fanning feelings of communalism in the Indian states having Muslim voters, whereas in other states, Dalit and other lower/schedule caste people are instigated to create an exploitable poll atmosphere to garner max Hindu voters.  In the same bid, Bima-Koregaon incident in Pune has become bass of unfolding strategy of BJP against Dalits and liberal class of Indian society. Reportedly, five persons (liberals/HR activists) namely Shoma Sen (Ex-head of English department of Pune university), Gadling, Sidhir (Dalit poet), Mahesh Raut and Rona Wilson (Committee of Political Prisoners) were arrested in Bima-Koregaon case under charges of promoting enmity between two communities. More, arrests are being done by the Indian government and Vara Rao arrest is part of the same. Later, they were declared as Maoists and off-late, are accused to conspire for “Modi’s assassination case”. Arrests of these five persons have attracted country-wide condemnation.  Regarding BJP pre-election strategy, in the recent past, Indian media reported,  “Amid talks of an alliance of SP (Samajwadi Party) with BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party), Uttar Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hold a two-day state executive meeting in Meerut on August 11, 12 to chalk out strategy for the 2019 general election. Party chief Amit Shah also attended the crucial meeting along with top state leaders and other senior ministers….Amit Shah briefed party leaders on how to strengthen the vote bank in every booth across the state…Discussions were also held regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming events in UP including a mega farmer rally in Shahjahanpur on July 21 after minimum support price (MSP) for at least 19 crops were raised by the government…Leaders have been directed to strengthen the party’s reach in areas dominated by SP-BSP and to reach out to maximum number of voters by highlighting achievements of both the central and the state government. The Western UP district Meerut has been chosen for the state executive because of a sizeable population of Dalits, backward classes and Muslims there.”  In this respect, under the caption, “With Eyes on 2019, BJP Is Shifting to a New and Sharper Polarisation, The BJP seems to be combining Dalits, Muslims and Left-liberals as the new combined other ”, Ajay Gudavarthy wrote in a blog, published on June 25, 2018 on the website-The Wire In Com: “As we move closer to the next general election, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to be refashioning its strategy to gear up to the challenge of 2019 with a much-reduced credibility. For 2014, it employed a more Congress-style accommodative politics within the larger grid of a populist strategy, creating a narrative of ‘us’ versus ‘them’– essentially to target the religious minorities and portray them as the outsiders. This was coupled with the credibility crisis facing the Congress. The party also had the advantage of Narendra Modi’s image, who at the time was seen as a decisive leader who could deliver dramatic results. Many of these advantages are now on the wane…BJP realises it cannot repeat the magic figures in much of north India, and also perhaps in the west. The initial strategy was to compensate the loss with some compensation in the east, spreading to Bengal and other parts of the northeastern states. Similarly, BJP wished to spread its hold in the southern states too…The prospect of notching up even a simple majority looks to be a herculean task at the moment for the BJP. Going by the shift in its political discourse in the recent past, they seem to have decided to give up the old kind of accommodative politics in favour of a new kind of polarisation–which involves more than bothering of Muslims. What is new is that the BJP has given up on Dalit votes too. The BJP will continue to practice the policy of sub-dividing Dalits in order to gain votes of smaller Dalit sub-castes that have remained unrepresented. Krishna Madiga, a robust Madiga leader from Telangana has been campaigning nation-wide to put the issue of sub-division of scheduled castes on the national agenda. This may yield some results, but more crucial seems to be the strategy of combining Dalits, Muslims and Left-liberals as the new combined other…In order to achieve this, it is beginning to draft a new narrative that is more explicitly critical of the Dalits, along with the Muslims. Bhima-Koregaon was the first salvo they fired to consolidate this narrative. Further, the projected link between Dalits and Jihad Islam is the next layer of this new polarisation.  As part of this, they have claimed that Jignesh Mevani received funding from Islamic groups and now it is Rohith Vemula’s mother who is being condemned for allegedly receiving help from the IUML. These two layers are then being used to suggest links between jihadi Islamic groups, Dalits and the Maoists to symbolise the Left.The recent claims of a possible  a possible Maoist attack being planned against Modi further reinforce such an implication. Maoist and jihadi link has been mentioned in the case of the Bhima-Koregaon incident. All of these will be now be stitched to the Kashmiri separatists and militancy in the Valley. With the pulling out of the government in Jammu and Kashmir, BJP is attempting to entrench the image of Muslims as essentially being ungrateful and unreasonable in spite of the repeated attempts of the party to appease them…Kashmiris performing well in the UPSC (one of them even represented the Indian cricket team–another symbol of jingoistic nationalism) and the declaration of ceasefire during Ramzan. This, BJP feels, has set the stage to consolidate the sense of violation among the majority Hindus, alongside consolidating the upper-caste vote-bank by isolating the Dalits…Congress is being projected as being soft on Muslim fundamentalism, Dalit aggression and a national threat from the Left-oriented political groups such as the Maoists. These three groups, along with Kashmiris represent the impending national security threat, tacitly supported by the Congress. With the saturation of leadership positions in the regional party, smaller groups among the OBCs [Other Backward Classes-Scheduled Casts and Scheduled Tribes] have steadily moved to the BJP and remained a potent force.

"Indian Insecure Nuclear Programme, Threatening Regional and Global Peace ","In its report, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) disclosed on 18, this year that an estimated 110-130 Indian nuclear bombs are stored in six or so government–run sites across India. Within the next five years to one decade, as many as 60 reactors will also be functional in India with the active cooperation of the US led western and far eastern allies.  In the past, several incidents of leakage and theft in addition to alarming episodes of lax security on existing nuclear sites in view of a history of civil tumult have occurred in India. India is notorious for highly lax security of its nuclear facilities. The episode of 8 October 2014 at Kalpakkam, when a soldier of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) responsible for protecting nuclear materials, went on a rampage to destroy the security of the facility leading to nuclear material theft by criminals. This and many incidents in the past including theft and leakage incidents of 2003, 2008, 2009 and 2013 are alarming examples of what inside and outside officials depict as serious short-comings in India’s nuclear safeguards.  India and Japan have a bad record of nuclear reactor leakage due to various reasons which consequently proved disastrous. But, Indian poor nuclear security has broken all the records.  Indian media reported on July 5, this year that the Kolkata police have arrested five men with 1 kg of uranium valued at around Rs. 3 crores ($440,000).  The Times of India elaborated that the men had come to Kolkata in the state of West Bengal to try to sell the substance. Police were quoted as saying that two packets of a “yellow-coloured substance” were seized.  It is notable that when the US former President Barack Obama hosted the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in Washington on March 31, 2016 to check the spread of nuclear weapons, showing concerns about the ambitions of terrorist groups such as the ISIS in acquiring a nuclear weapon or radioactive material, , the US President Donald Trump had taken a different stand in his interview with the CNN by stating, “More nuclear weapons could make the world safer…US can no longer afford to bankroll the defense of its allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East…Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia may need arsenals to confront threats in their region on their own.”  Similarly, by pursuing the double standards of America and some Western countries in its worst form, President Trump also favoured India, while opposing the nuclear weapons of Pakistan. Because, being the only nuclear country in the Islamic World, Pakistan annoys the US, Israel and some Western countries. As a matter of fact, it is Zionist agenda to ‘denculearise’ Pakistan. However, like Obama, Trump has brushed aside the ground realities that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi led by the ruling fundamentalist party BJP has been implementing anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan agenda.  As part of their double game, these US-led countries have ignored Indian poor record of nuclear security, non-proliferation, lack of safety of workers, working at Indian nuclear facilities and lack of any appropriate regulatory authority.  Indian past record proves various kinds of security and safety lapses regarding various nuclear plants and the related sensitive materials, including events of leakage, nuclear theft, smuggling and killing.  In this regard, in November, 2009, more than 90 Indian workers suffered radiation due to contamination of drinking water at the Kaiga Atomic Power Station in Karnataka.  On July 27, 1991, a similar event occurred at the heavy water plant run by the Department of Atomic Energy at Rawatbhata in Rajasthan. Nuclear radiation had affected and injured many laborers there.  In July 1998, India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) seized eight Kg. of nuclear material from three engineers in Chennai, which was stolen from an atomic research center.  On November 7, 2000, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) disclosed that Indian police had seized 57 pounds of uranium and arrested two men for illicit trafficking of radioactive material. IAEA had revealed that Indian civil nuclear facilities were vulnerable to thefts.  On January 26, 2003, CNN pointed out that Indian company, NEC Engineers Private Ltd. shipped 10 consignments to Iraq, containing highly sensitive equipments entailing titanium vessels and centrifugal pumps.  In December 2006, a container packed with radioactive material had been stolen from an Indian fortified research atomic facility near Mumbai.  In June 2009, India’s nuclear scientist, Lokanathan Mahalingam missed from the scenario and after a couple of days; his dead body was recovered from the Kali River. Indian police concocted a story that Mahalingam had committed suicide by jumping into the river. It is a big joke to hide some real facts behind his death because wisdom proves that if an educated person decides to commit suicide, he will definitely adopt a soft way to eliminate his life. Afterwards, Dr. Haleema Saadia said that death of the scientist was a conspiracy.  Nevertheless, such events in connection with nuclear material continued unabated in India, putting the security of atomic weapons and their related components, including the lives of workers at high risk.  It is mentionable that during his first visit to New Delhi, on November 6, 2010. President Obama announced the measures, America would take regarding removal of Indian space and defence companies from a restricted “entities list”, and supported Indian demand membership of four key global nuclear nonproliferation regimes.  And as part of the double standards in relation to India and Pakistan, America set aside the Indian poor record regarding the safety of nuclear weapons and related materials. Despite, Indian violations of various international agreements and its refusal to sign Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and Additional Protocol with the IAEA, Washington signed a pact of nuclear civil technology with New Delhi in 2008. During AmericanPresident Barack Obama’s visit to India, on January 25, 2016, the US and India announced a breakthrough on the pact which would allow American companies to supply New Delhi with civilian nuclear technology.  Notably, America is a potential military supplier to India. US also pressurized IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to grant a waiver to New Delhi for obtaining civil nuclear trade on larger scale.  Evidences indicate that India has not fulfilled the conditions of the NSG waiver. At least, eight of India’s nuclear reactors are outside safeguards which are a big question mark on the credibility of its nuclear safety and security standards. Two reports from the King’s College–respectively titled ‘India’s Nuclear Exceptionalism’ and ‘India’s Strategic Nuclear and Missile Program’ also claim that India has already accumulated nuclear material for over 2600 nuclear weapons, including all of its unsafeguarded reactor-grade plutonium, which is weapon-usable, and raised concerns over this stockpiling.  In fact, in the pretext of countering China, Washington has continued favouring India’s programme of advancement and modernization of nuclear weapons. US supports Indian nuclear programme in the pretext of anti-China and anti-Pakistan approach. Beijing is apprehensive about the emerging threat, as during the last visit of Obama to New Delhi, the intent of President Obama and Indian Prime Minister Modi was quite clear, while mentioning about free sea lanes and air passages in the South China Sea. President Trump is also pursuing the policy of his predecessor in this respect, as in the recent past, during his meeting with Prime Minister Modi, he showed similar approach.  Nonetheless, arms deals with America, which also include nuclear submarines to New Delhi, would increase Indian hegemonic designs in the region. And NSG’s membership of India will create concerns for regional strategic stability.  Besides obtaining atomic weapons from the US and other Western countries, New Delhi is, clandestinely, importing nuclear arms, components and submarines from Tel Aviv. In this connection, Zionist-led Indo-Israeli secret diplomacy could be assessed from the interview of Israel’s ambassador to India, Mark Sofer, published in the Indian weekly Outlook on February 18, 2008. Regarding India’s defense arrangements with Tel Aviv, Sofer had surprisingly revealed, “We do have a defense relationship with India, and “with all due respect, the secret part will remain a secret.”  Although these atomic weapons seem to be mysterious, yet still could be within the reach of some Hindu terrorists with the help of RAW which might have also got these destructive arms from Mossad. Such atomic weapons or radiological materials could have also been smuggled inside India by the Hindu fundamentalists with the covert assistance of RAW.  Frustrated in isolating Islamabad, RAW in connivance with Mossad might have prepared a most dangerous plan to use nuclear weapons or dirty nuclear bombs inside the US homeland or any major European country to implicate Pakistan for having allegedly used these weapons through some Taliban militants.  Particularly, RAW and Mossad may also employ these fatal weapons against NATO forces in Afghanistan, as India and Israel want to prolong the stay of the US-led NATO troops in Afghanistan which have become the center of their covert activities against Pakistan, Russia, China and Iran. Terrorists of the Islamic State outfit (Also known as Daesh, ISIS and ISIL) which are strategic assets of the CIA may be used by RAW and Mossad for employment of these unconventional weapons. While, India, Israel and America are also playing double game against one another, hence, by utilizing the vicious circle of terrorism, New Delhi can alone use these weapons through Afghanistan-based Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and ISIS which are also being backed by RAW, CIA and Mossad, and have claimed responsibility for several terror assaults inside Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the recent ones. So, RAW’s sole aim will be to provoke Americans and its allies against Islamabad which is challenging Indian hegemony in the region. Thus, Indian RAW could create a dangerous misunderstanding in which US could use small nuclear weapons against Pakistan or could ask the latter of rollback its atomic programme.  Undoubtedly, in such an environment, considering India qualified for acquiring of nuclear technology through “global powers” led NSG and IAEA and obstructing Pakistan’s safe nuclear energy programme is discriminatory as well as an effort to hinder peace and economic progress of Pakistan. And unsafe materials in nuclear facilities patrolled by low morale CISF troops across India are also liable to be stolen by insiders having grievances against employers and typical Hindu mindset of Indian leadership. These stolen materials could be used by Indian sponsored ISIS elements. Washington and its other allies, instead of pressing India for quick nuclear reforms are encouraging India to expand its nuclear stockpiles. The US led West need to take cognizance of such ventures rather than criticizing Pak-China civil nuclear cooperation.  In light of these negative developments, we can conclude that Indian insecure nuclear programme is threatening regional and global peace. Therefore, world’s various forums such as EU and UNO, including Russia should also take cognizance of New Delhi in this regard.

Double Game is the BJP Election Strategy ,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s extremist party-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had got a land sliding triumph in the Indian elections 2014 on the basis of anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan slogans. Therefore, since the Prime Minister Modi came to power, he has been implementing anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan agenda with the support of fanatic coalition outfits.  Now, double game has become the BJP strategy to win the Indian general elections 2019. In this regard, BJP leadership seems to have geared up its activity for forthcoming poll-2019. Party’s chief strategist Amit Shah is deliberately fanning feelings of communalism in the Indian states having Muslim voters, whereas in other states, Dalit and other lower/schedule caste people are instigated to create an exploitable poll atmosphere to garner max Hindu voters.  In the same bid, Bima-Koregaon incident in Pune has become bass of unfolding strategy of BJP against Dalits and liberal class of Indian society. Reportedly, five persons (liberals/HR activists) namely Shoma Sen (Ex-head of English department of Pune university), Gadling, Sidhir (Dalit poet), Mahesh Raut and Rona Wilson (Committee of Political Prisoners) were arrested in Bima-Koregaon case under charges of promoting enmity between two communities. More, arrests are being done by the Indian government and Vara Rao arrest is part of the same. Later, they were declared as Maoists and off-late, are accused to conspire for “Modi’s assassination case”. Arrests of these five persons have attracted country-wide condemnation.  Regarding BJP pre-election strategy, in the recent past, Indian media reported,  “Amid talks of an alliance of SP (Samajwadi Party) with BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party), Uttar Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hold a two-day state executive meeting in Meerut on August 11, 12 to chalk out strategy for the 2019 general election. Party chief Amit Shah also attended the crucial meeting along with top state leaders and other senior ministers….Amit Shah briefed party leaders on how to strengthen the vote bank in every booth across the state…Discussions were also held regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming events in UP including a mega farmer rally in Shahjahanpur on July 21 after minimum support price (MSP) for at least 19 crops were raised by the government…Leaders have been directed to strengthen the party’s reach in areas dominated by SP-BSP and to reach out to maximum number of voters by highlighting achievements of both the central and the state government. The Western UP district Meerut has been chosen for the state executive because of a sizeable population of Dalits, backward classes and Muslims there.”  In this respect, under the caption, “With Eyes on 2019, BJP Is Shifting to a New and Sharper Polarisation, The BJP seems to be combining Dalits, Muslims and Left-liberals as the new combined other ”, Ajay Gudavarthy wrote in a blog, published on June 25, 2018 on the website-The Wire In Com: “As we move closer to the next general election, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to be refashioning its strategy to gear up to the challenge of 2019 with a much-reduced credibility. For 2014, it employed a more Congress-style accommodative politics within the larger grid of a populist strategy, creating a narrative of ‘us’ versus ‘them’– essentially to target the religious minorities and portray them as the outsiders. This was coupled with the credibility crisis facing the Congress. The party also had the advantage of Narendra Modi’s image, who at the time was seen as a decisive leader who could deliver dramatic results. Many of these advantages are now on the wane…BJP realises it cannot repeat the magic figures in much of north India, and also perhaps in the west. The initial strategy was to compensate the loss with some compensation in the east, spreading to Bengal and other parts of the northeastern states. Similarly, BJP wished to spread its hold in the southern states too…The prospect of notching up even a simple majority looks to be a herculean task at the moment for the BJP. Going by the shift in its political discourse in the recent past, they seem to have decided to give up the old kind of accommodative politics in favour of a new kind of polarisation–which involves more than bothering of Muslims. What is new is that the BJP has given up on Dalit votes too. The BJP will continue to practice the policy of sub-dividing Dalits in order to gain votes of smaller Dalit sub-castes that have remained unrepresented. Krishna Madiga, a robust Madiga leader from Telangana has been campaigning nation-wide to put the issue of sub-division of scheduled castes on the national agenda. This may yield some results, but more crucial seems to be the strategy of combining Dalits, Muslims and Left-liberals as the new combined other…In order to achieve this, it is beginning to draft a new narrative that is more explicitly critical of the Dalits, along with the Muslims. Bhima-Koregaon was the first salvo they fired to consolidate this narrative. Further, the projected link between Dalits and Jihad Islam is the next layer of this new polarisation.  As part of this, they have claimed that Jignesh Mevani received funding from Islamic groups and now it is Rohith Vemula’s mother who is being condemned for allegedly receiving help from the IUML. These two layers are then being used to suggest links between jihadi Islamic groups, Dalits and the Maoists to symbolise the Left.The recent claims of a possible  a possible Maoist attack being planned against Modi further reinforce such an implication. Maoist and jihadi link has been mentioned in the case of the Bhima-Koregaon incident. All of these will be now be stitched to the Kashmiri separatists and militancy in the Valley. With the pulling out of the government in Jammu and Kashmir, BJP is attempting to entrench the image of Muslims as essentially being ungrateful and unreasonable in spite of the repeated attempts of the party to appease them…Kashmiris performing well in the UPSC (one of them even represented the Indian cricket team–another symbol of jingoistic nationalism) and the declaration of ceasefire during Ramzan. This, BJP feels, has set the stage to consolidate the sense of violation among the majority Hindus, alongside consolidating the upper-caste vote-bank by isolating the Dalits…Congress is being projected as being soft on Muslim fundamentalism, Dalit aggression and a national threat from the Left-oriented political groups such as the Maoists. These three groups, along with Kashmiris represent the impending national security threat, tacitly supported by the Congress. With the saturation of leadership positions in the regional party, smaller groups among the OBCs [Other Backward Classes-Scheduled Casts and Scheduled Tribes] have steadily moved to the BJP and remained a potent force. OBCs have got increasingly drawn into the communal anti-Muslim rhetoric for various reasons, including the need to fit into hyper-masculine claims that figuratively draw them closer to the way Kshatriyas self-represent themselves. Hyper-nationalist discourse allows space for these not so visible cultural traits to find a legitimate social narrative”  It is notable that regarding the forthcoming elections, as part of the double game, BJP-led Indian government and media which are in collusion have also started a propaganda campaign against Pakistan’s Armed Forces and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). There is also a co-relation between the Hindu fundamentalist parties such as BJP, RSS and Indian secret agency RAW. Since distorting the image of Pakistan is the agenda of RAW, therefore, it suits BJP and its militant wing, the RSS.  In this connection, reportedly, some quarters of Indian media have started to hurl another ugly allegation that Pak’s intelligence agency ISI will attempt to sabotage “Indian Polls of 2019” as well.  It is mentionable that as part of the double game, by continuing false flag operations, on Setember18, 2016, New Delhi staged the drama of the terror attack in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) at a military base in Uri, close to the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan. After the episode, without any investigation, India’s top civil and military officials, including their media started propaganda against Pakistan, it Army and ISI by accusing that the militants who targeted the Uri base came from Pakistan’s side of Azad Kashmir. By manipulating that false flag terror attack, the BJP-led Indian Prime Minister Modi had also accelerated war-hysteria against Pakistan and instructed Indian forces to continue shelling across the LoC and Working Boundary, which have killed many innocent civilians inside Pakistani side of Kashmir and other nearby villages. Now, in order win the elections of 2019 through double game, Indian forces are continuously violating the LoC through intermittent shelling and have compelled Pakistan Army to give a matching response.  Particularly, Indian media, while highlighting false flag operations of the Modi government, will create a link of the arrested people with Pakistan soon, though allegations regarding Pakistan, affecting her elections are fanciful, fabricated and baseless.  However, following a well throughout plan; BJP is playing anti-Muslim/anti-Pakistan card to gain votes of a majority of Hindus. Earlier, BJP intended to create fissures in Muslim voters by blowing up “Triple Talaq” (irrevocable divorce), issue aiming to get votes of Muslim women, but the move turned to be counterproductive. Resultantly, BJP is focusing on Hindu votes by creating a series of anti-Muslim and anti Pakistan controversies, as seen in Jawher Lal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi and Ali Garh Muslim University (Abdullah Mustafvi) Alighar.  The same card would be played in Jamiya Miliya Islamiya, Delhi and Usmaniya University, Hyderabad in next few months, where Pakistan is also likely to be maligned.  The controversies of JNU and Abdullah Mustafvi were created to implicate Islamabad through a well-deliberated media campaign. In the recent past, journalists from Pakistan and Indian Occupied Kashmir were invited on the talk shows and efforts were made to mould their point of view.  Continuing anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan approach, the pre-election strategy of the BJP is also to create a rift among the leaders of Kashmiris.  Regarding pre-election activities of the BJP, an analyst remarked, “This needs to be taken up as an urgent campaign around the country, a campaign that is inclusive of all whose hearts beat for the nation. And one cannot wait until the dates of the next elections are announced to start this campaign. It is not hard to imagine that the electoral process and this campaign are intimately intertwined. The BJP’s Hindutva [Hindu nationalism] card is its chosen pathway to electoral victory”.  Undoubtedly, we may conclude that the double game has become the BJP strategy for the general elections 2019.

Crawling and Checking the Original Website Utilize a crawling apparatus to get a file of pages and different critical bits of Meta information that the user will need to allude back to all through the procedure. Make a point to spare the crawl. The user will require this data with a specific end goal to guarantee congruity between your unique Ecommerce SEO website and the better and brighter one.  Creating A Duplicate Website In creating the duplicate website, encourage the designers to remember the accompanying amid their procedure if conceivable:  In a perfect world, the first website crawl should go about as a format for the fresh website. Make a duplicate of the first crawl and create notes on the site of any progressions to be complete on the fresh website, particularly any links that will be removed or changed. Address any problems you experienced in evaluating the old website and guide the progressions to the fresh website and note the process in the first website crawl duplicate.

India’s Water Warfare against Pakistan ,"On August 7, this year, under the caption, “Pakistan fears India getting ready for water warfare through dams”, Indian TV channel Zee News though pointed out Pakistan’s apprehensions, but, admitted that India has initiated water warfare against Pakistan.  In its news, Zee News criticized a statement of the then caretaker Pakistani Minister for water resources Ali Zafar where he suspected that there could be Indian hand behind construction of Kalabagh Dam. “Opposition for Kalabagh Dam (KBD) is from the political pundits in Pakistan who have a known attachment with India…He has also skammed India’s Kishanganga Project yet again. Whether Kalabagh Dam construction commences in near future or not, the fact on ground that is pinching India is that Pakistan has finally decided to construct Diamer Bhasha Dam which is likely to commence very soon. Several Dam projects in India have been…Pakistan fear India getting ready for water Warfare through dams. Speaking to members of the press, Ali Zafar then pointed an accusatory finger at India and said that several dam projects across the border have been in violation of water treaties signed in the past. The Kishanganga Hydropower Project was in for specific criticism…The Kishanganga Project was inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi on May 19. Islamabad now possibly fears that this and other dam projects could help India bleed Pakistan dry. India has managed to build about 400 damns after the Indus Water Treaty while Pakistan has not even managed to build the KBD. It (KBD) is very important. It is life — and it should be built as a priority.”  In fact, while heading a four-judge bench hearing regarding Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand dams case and taking note of the water scarcity in Pakistan, including its implications, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan Mian Saqib said on July 30, 2018 that “construction of dams in the country is the responsibility of the elected government and the judiciary is just assisting it in this matter. The decision to collect funds for the construction of such projects is not controversial and the government can take over the responsibility if it so wishes. We will ensure that public money, collected for the construction of dams should not be misused.” Referring to the Kalabagh dam, Justice Nisar said:” Consensus would be left to the public and their elected representatives.  The government established the Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand Dam Fund after the Supreme Court issued directives on July 4, 2018 that construction of the two dams should start immediately and appealed to the people, including overseas Pakistanis, to make a contribution for executing the projects.  It is notable that from the very beginning India had initiated water warfare against Pakistan.  Since its inception, India has never missed an opportunity to victimise Pakistan by creating deliberate water scarcity with the aim to damage the latter agriculturally. Last year, Indian extremist Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given the concerned departments to continue construction of dams and ordered diverting water of Chenab River to Beas, which is a serious violation of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) of 1960. Therefore, Pakistan-India water dispute has been deepened.  In this regard, a high-powered Pakistani delegation led by Pakistan ‘s Attorney General Ashtar Ausaf Ali met with World Bank Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva and other senior officials in Washington on May 21-22, 2018 for resolution of disputes on Kishanganga Hydro Electric Power (KHEP) and Rampur Hydro Electric Power (RHEP). World Bank’s, senior vice president and Group General Counsel has forwarded a letter to Ashtar Ausaf Ali. The letter contains a summary of ideas to resolve the stalemate and proffers two proposals for which concerned authorities (MoWR/AGP) will shortly convene a meeting to finalize Pakistan’s proposals—Proposal 1: Pakistan accepts Indian request to appoint neutral Expert (NE) and Proposal 2: India accepts Pakistan’s request for emplacement of Court of Arbitration (COA).  The World Bank is working with Pakistan and India to resolve Pakistan-India disputes on Kishanganga Hydro Electric Power (KHEP) and Rampur Hydro Electric Power (RHEP) in light of the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT).  A statement of the World Bank said: “The delegation of the Government of Pakistan also shared with the Bank their concerns about the recent inauguration of the Kishanganga hydroelectric plant” and the World Bank assured that it will address Islamabad’s concerns regarding Indian violations of the IWT.  But, quite contrary to the above, it has been observed that a deliberate and sustained dis-information campaign has been launched on both print and electronic media of India that Pakistan has lost its case of water dispute at international forum i.e. World Bank.  It is noteworthy that in the recent past, Prime Minister Modi had inaugurated the 330MW Kishanganga hydroelectric project in Jammu and Kashmir. Islamabad had protested the inauguration, claiming that the project on a river flowing into Pakistan will disrupt water supplies.  It is mentionable that Pakistan is a grave victim of water scarcity, because of being on lower riparian in relation to the rivers emanating from the Indian-Held Kashmir (IHK). New Delhi is creating deliberate water shortages for Pakistan with the aim to impair Pakistan agriculturally.  Historically, India has been trying to establish her hegemony in the region by controlling water sources and damaging agricultural economies of her neighbouring states. India has water disputes with Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. Under the extremist government of Prime Minister Modi, Pakistan has become specially target, as India’s water terrorism continues unabated.  In this respect, in an article, Zofeen T. Ebrahim, Joydeep Gupta (Co-Authors) under the caption, “India resists World Bank move to resolve Indus Water Treaty dispute”, published in The Third Pole and reproduced-updated by a Pakistan’s renowned daily on January 6, 2017 is notable.  Zofeen T. Ebrahim and Joydeep Gupta wrote, “India has asked the World Bank not to rush in to resolve a dispute with Pakistan over the Kishanganga and Ratle hydropower projects. Indian officials told a World Bank representative in New Delhi on January 5 that any differences over the projects can be resolved bilaterally or through a neutral expert. Pakistan has objected to the projects–being built by India in Jammu and Kashmir–on the grounds that they violate the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) between the two countries. After India rejected the charge, Pakistan has gone to the World Bank–the designated IWT mediator…Islamabad has also asked the United States (US) government to intervene, and has added the component of water security to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) agreement…The Kishanganga project is on a tributary of the Jhelum, while the Ratle project is on the Chenab….As the dispute flared up, the World Bank had recently suspended all proceedings–the setting up of a court of arbitration or the appointment of a neutral expert. On January 5, World Bank representative Ian H Solomon met officials of India’s External Affairs and Water Resources ministries in New Delhi in an effort to break the deadlock. The Indian delegation, led by Gopal Baglay, Joint secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs, made a detailed a presentation on the two projects to support their argument that neither project violated the IWT. After the meeting, a government official told journalists that the Indian side had described the objections raised by Pakistan as “technical”, and therefore they would be best resolved by a neutral expert…Pakistan has dismissed this suggestion earlier, and is seeking a full court of arbitration. The World Bank had agreed to a court of arbitration and then to the appointment of a neutral expert, leading to objections by both countries. That was when both processes were suspended. Explore: World Bank pauses dam arbitration to ‘protect Indus Waters Treaty.’ At the January 5 meeting, Solomon did not raise any question on the designs of the two projects, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. Instead, he explored ways to resolve the dispute. With nothing decided, the World Bank official is going from New Delhi to Islamabad to continue this effort…Under the IWT, India is allowed only non-consumptive use of water from the three western rivers in the Indus basin–Indus, Jhelum and Chenab…The recent stance by India where it “lobbied aggressively and influenced” the World Bank, he feared, had further undermined the already “fragile” treaty. “The WB needs to take the right action–which is to act as arbitrator in this matter, as it has done before,” pointed out water expert Simi Kamal…The Bank needs to maintain this role and not back off now, when its arbitration role is most required in the face of a belligerent Indian government.”  However, New Delhi’s construction of several dams and new plans for more dams in the Indian Occupied Kashmir is part of its most dangerous scheme of water warfare, being waged against Islamabad in order to further harm all political, economic, financial and social spheres of Pakistan.  In this connection, in March, 2011, speaking in diplomatic language, Indus Water Commissioner of India G. Ranganathan denied that India’s decision to build dams on rivers led to water shortage in Pakistan. He also rejected Islamabad’s concerns at water theft by New Delhi or violation of the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, assuring his counterpart, Syed Jamaat Ali Shah that all issues relating to water would be resolved through dialogue. However, ground realties are quite different from what Ranganathan maintained.  Besides other permanent issues and, especially the dispute of Kashmir which has always been used by India to malign and pressurize Pakistan, water of rivers has become a matter of life and death for every Pakistani, as New Delhi has been employing it as a tool of terrorism to blackmail Pakistan.",INDIA,Fake
Assamese Muslims are being Denied Indian Citizenship ,"Under the mask of democracy and secularism, Indian subsequent regimes dominated by politicians from the Hindi heartland—Hindutva (Hindu nationalism) have been using brutal tactics mercilessly in suppressing the insurgencies and separatist movements in various regions and provinces such as Kashmir, Punjab, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura etc. including Maoists (Naxalite). These movements are the result of political, social, economic and religious justices which have been accelerated by the BJP-led extremist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose party won the elections in 2014 on the basis of anti-Muslim slogans.  Besides, assaults on the Muslims in various parts of India, BJP-led alliance of the extremist parties have been targeting the 4 million Assamese Muslims who are being denied Indian citizenship under National Register of Citizens (NRC), introduced by the BJP government, as they are dubbed as Bangladeshi-speaking Muslims. As per adopted strategy, BJP is pushing NRC as an use of national security and crucial solution to the problem of unemployment.  In this regard, under the caption, “40 Lakh People Excluded From Citizen’s Register In Assam, Thousands Of Bengali-Speaking Muslims Fear Deportation”, Huffington Post wrote on July 30, 2018: “India said on Monday [July 30, 2018] it had excluded more than four million people from a draft National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam who could not produce valid documents, a move that has sparked fears about the future of thousands in the region. Security has been tightened across the state, which borders Bangladesh, as thousands of Bengali-speaking Muslims worry about being sent to detention centres or deported. The tea-rich state of Assam has long been the centre of social and communal tensions with locals campaigning against illegal immigrants, a fight that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist-led government has championed. In 1983, scores of people were chased down and killed by machete-armed…Critics see the citizenship test as another measure supported by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aimed at minority Muslims…If the government has decided to brand us foreigners what can we do?, said Abdul Suban, 60, a Bengali-speaking Muslim, earlier. The NRC is trying to finish us off. Our people have died here, but we will not leave this place.”  Under the title “Assam register: Four million risk losing Indian citizenship”, BBC said on July 30, this year: “India has published a list which effectively strips about four million people in the north-eastern state of Assam of their citizenship. The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a list of people who can prove they came to the state by 24 March 1971, a day before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence. India says the process is needed to identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants. But it has sparked fears of a witch hunt against Assam’s ethnic minorities. More than 32 million people submitted documents to the NRC to prove they were citizens, but four million of them have been excluded from the published list. Many Bengalis a linguistic minority in Assam-are worried they will be deported en masse. Hasitun Nissa, who spoke to the BBC’s Joe Miller said, It is where the 47-year-old schoolteacher spent her childhood, where she studied, where she got married and where she had her four children. She said her family arrived in India before 1971 but she expected to be stripped of her Indian citizenship and feared her land rights, voting rights and freedom would be in peril. Activists say the NRC is now being used as a pretext for a two-pronged attack-by Hindu nationalists and Assamese hardliners-on the state’s Bengali community, a large portion of whom are Muslims. Like Hasitun, many Bengalis live in the wetlands dotted along the Bramaputra river, moving around when water levels rise…Bengali campaigner Nazrul Ali Ahmed is adamant that the NRC is…nothing but a conspiracy to commit atrocities, he told the BBC. They are openly threatening to get rid of Muslims, and what happened to the Rohingya in Myanmar, could happen to us here…The latest move to make millions of people stateless overnight has sparked fears of violence in what is already a tinderbox state. Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the state, has insisted in the past that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported. But neighbouring Bangladesh will definitely not accede to such a request. Chances are India will end up creating the newest cohort of stateless people, raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo the Rohingya people who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. No deportation procedures have been put in place, and Bangladesh, already burdened by the Rohingya crisis, has shown no sign of being open to accepting a raft of new refugees.”  However, many Muslims of Assam-bloggers and writers have been highlighting the issue through media, various websites, including social media before the international community and the Muslim world over the issue, as Assam Muslims are being denied of their basic right of citizenship.  According to them, “The updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) list is a move to target Assam’s Muslim population on the pretext of weeding out Bangladeshi migrants. In Karimganj, a district bordering Bangladesh, 91.53% made it through in the final NRC draft. This is a marked increase compared to the first draft when 38% were included. Of the 13, 24,096 applicants 12, 11,997 have been included in the final NRC draft. There are so many people there in the jail, including women. Please consider this case on humanitarian grounds. Does central government have any rehabilitation package for them? Divide and rule policy will finish the country. This government will never spoke to us (Bengal and Bangladesh). Assam people are helpless and cannot connect with us also. This is not only Bengali speaking people, of course. There are so many Biharis. Will they not protest if they are tortured? I cannot contact Bangladesh as it is an external affairs situation and is not my matter. But I will raise the issue, which Bangladesh will also oppose. This is a wrong decision and will affect the entire country — all caste, creed and community. If I get the opportunity, I will meet home minister Rajnath Singh, says Mamata Banerjee on NRC Assam issue…situation in Assam is fragile and “human rights and democratic rights” of the people of the state are at stake….Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav (SP) said the move would lead to “hatred” and “violence” in Assam and dubbed it as a “war on people” who are living in the state for the last 40 years.”  In this respect, in a well-known website Rediff Com, Nibir Deka wrote on August 14, 2018, “The story got another twist. The districts where Bengali was spoken witnessed a surge in Muslim population. While leaders of the Assam movement saw their struggle as linguistic where many Muslims also died for the cause (the official martyrs list of the Assam agitation as published in assamaccord.assam.gov.in cites the names of various Muslim leaders who had died during the struggle), emphasis on the religious element of the problem came to the fore when the BJP brought the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, which envisaged giving citizenship to non-Muslim refugees who sought a safe haven in India from religious persecution in their countries. The Bill was opposed by all Assam agitation leaders barring the BJP…According to a notification of the ministry of home affairs in March this year, there is no specific treaty or agreement with the government of Bangladesh regarding repatriation of its citizens who had entered India illegally. This puts a question mark on the future of the people who will be declared ‘illegal’ after the NRC finishes its work. As they are–in all likelihood–going to be Bengali-speaking Muslims, Mamata Banerjee is the one who is most alarmed, because it is to West Bengal that they will shift. But she also sees a political opportunity in playing minority politics. The BJP can also see a bigger project of using the citizenship issue to extend it from a nationalities issue to a patriotism issue.”  It is notable that the issue of the Muslims of Assam reminds Bangladeshi Muslims of Indian highhandedness and it could create a wedge between Bangladesh and India.  Nevertheless, the leaders of the Western countries, their media and human rights groups must take notice of the plight of Assam’s Muslims who are being targeting by the fundamentalist regime of the BJP and are being denied of their basic right of the Indian citizenship.

Question of Indian Nuclear Security ,"Indian media reported on July 5, this year that the Kolkata police have arrested five men with 1 kg. of uranium valued at around Rs. 3 crores ($440,000).  The Times of India elaborated that the men had come to Kolkata in the state of West Bengal to try to sell the substance. Police were quoted as saying that two packets of a “yellow-coloured substance” were seized.  However, it is not the new event, as the same also took place in India in the past.  It is notable that when the US former President Barack Obama hosted the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in Washington on March 31, 2016 to check the spread of nuclear weapons, showing concerns about the ambitions of terrorist groups such as the ISIS in acquiring a nuclear weapon or radioactive material, the US President Donald Trump had taken a different stand in his interview with the CNN by stating, “More nuclear weapons could make the world safer…US can no longer afford to bankroll the defense of its allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East…Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia may need arsenals to confront threats in their region on their own.”  Similarly, by following the double standards of America and some Western countries in its worst form, President Trump also favoured India, while opposing the nuclear weapons of Pakistan. Because, being the only nuclear country in the Islamic World, Pakistan annoys the US, Israel and some Western countries. As a matter of fact, it is Zionist agenda to ‘denculearise’ Pakistan. However, like Obama, Trump has brushed aside the ground realities that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi led by the ruling fundamentalist party BJP has been implementing anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan agenda.  As part of their double game, these US-led countries have ignored Indian poor record of nuclear security, non-proliferation, lack of safety of workers, working at Indian nuclear facilities and lack of any appropriate regulatory authority.  Indian past record proves various kinds of security and safety lapses regarding various nuclear plants and the related sensitive materials—events of leakage, nuclear theft, smuggling and killing.  In this regard, in November, 2009, more than 90 Indian workers suffered radiation due to contamination of drinking water at the Kaiga Atomic Power Station in Karnataka.  On July 27, 1991, a similar event occurred at the heavy water plant run by the Department of Atomic Energy at Rawatbhata in Rajasthan. Nuclear radiation had affected and injured many laborers there.  In July 1998, India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) seized eight Kg. of nuclear material from three engineers in Chennai, which was stolen from an atomic research center.  On November 7, 2000, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) disclosed that Indian police had seized 57 pounds of uranium and arrested two men for illicit trafficking of radioactive material. IAEA had revealed that Indian civil nuclear facilities were vulnerable to thefts.  On January 26, 2003, CNN pointed out that Indian company, NEC Engineers Private Ltd. shipped 10 consignments to Iraq, containing highly sensitive equipments entailing titanium vessels and centrifugal pumps.  In December 2006, a container packed with radioactive material had been stolen from an Indian fortified research atomic facility near Mumbai.  In June 2009, India’s nuclear scientist, Lokanathan Mahalingam missed from the scenario and after a couple of days; his dead body was recovered from the Kali River. Indian police concocted a story that Mahalingam had committed suicide by jumping into the river. It is a big joke to hide some real facts behind his death because wisdom proves that if an educated person decides to commit suicide, he will definitely adopt a soft way to eliminate his life. Afterwards, Dr. Haleema Saadia said that death of the scientist was a conspiracy.  Nevertheless, such events in connection with nuclear materials continued unabated in India, putting the security of atomic weapons and their related components, including the lives of workers at high risk.  It is mentionable that during his first visit to New Delhi, on November 6, 2010. President Obama announced the measures, America would take regarding removal of Indian space and defence companies from a restricted “entities list”, and supported Indian demand membership of four key global nuclear nonproliferation regimes.  And as part of the double standards in relation to India and Pakistan, America set aside the Indian poor record regarding the safety of nuclear weapons and related materials. Despite, Indian violations of various international agreements and its refusal to sign Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and Additional Protocol with the IAEA, Washington signed a pact of nuclear civil technology with New Delhi in 2008. During American President Barack Obama’s visit to India, on January 25, 2016, the US and India announced a breakthrough on the pact which would allow American companies to supply New Delhi with civilian nuclear technology.  Notably, America is a potential military supplier to India. US also pressurized IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to grant a waiver to New Delhi for obtaining civil nuclear trade on larger scale.  Evidences indicate that India has not fulfilled the conditions of the NSG waiver. At least, eight of India’s nuclear reactors are outside safeguards which are a big question mark on the credibility of its nuclear safety and security standards. Two reports from the King’s College–respectively titled ‘India’s Nuclear Exceptionalism’ and ‘India’s Strategic Nuclear and Missile Program’ also claim that India has already accumulated nuclear material for over 2600 nuclear weapons, including all of its unsafeguarded reactor-grade plutonium, which is weapon-usable, and raised concerns over this stockpiling.  In fact, in the pretext of countering China, Washington has continued favouring India’s programme of advancement and modernization of nuclear weapons. US supports India’s atomic programme in the pretext of anti-China and anti-Pakistan approach. Beijing is apprehensive about the emerging threat, as during the last visit of Obama to New Delhi, the intent of President Obama and Indian Prime Minister Modi was quite clear, while mentioning about free sea lanes and air passages in the South China Sea. President Trump is also pursuing the policy of his predecessor in this respect, as in the recent past, during his meeting with Prime Minister Modi, he showed similar approach.  Nevertheless, arms deals with America, which also include nuclear submarines to New Delhi, would increase Indian hegemonic designs in the region. And NSG’s membership of India will create concerns for regional strategic stability which is part of American global interests.  Besides obtaining atomic weapons from the US and other Western countries, New Delhi is, clandestinely, importing nuclear arms, components and submarines from Tel Aviv. In this connection, Zionist-led Indo-Israeli secret diplomacy could be assessed from the interview of Israel’s ambassador to India, Mark Sofer, published in the Indian weekly Outlook on February 18, 2008. Regarding India’s defense arrangements with Tel Aviv, Sofer had surprisingly revealed, “We do have a defense relationship with India, and “with all due respect, the secret part will remain a secret.”  Although these atomic weapons seem to be mysterious, yet still could be within the reach of some Hindu terrorists with the help of Indian intelligence agency RAW which might have also got these destructive arms from Israeli secret agency Mossad. Such atomic weapons or radiological materials could have also been smuggled inside India by the Hindu fundamentalists with the covert assistance of RAW.  Frustrated in isolating Islamabad, RAW in connivance with Mossad might have prepared a most dangerous plan to use nuclear weapons or dirty nuclear bombs inside the US homeland or any major European country to implicate Pakistan for having allegedly used these weapons through some Taliban militants.  Particularly, RAW and Mossad may also employ these fatal weapons against NATO forces in Afghanistan, as India and Israel want to prolong the stay of the US-led NATO troops in Afghanistan which have become the center of their covert activities against Pakistan, Russia, China and Iran. Terrorists of the Islamic State outfit (Also known as Daesh, ISIS and ISIL) which are strategic assets of the CIA may be used by RAW and Mossad for employment of these unconventional weapons. While, India, Israel and America are also playing double game against one another, hence, by utilizing the vicious circle of terrorism, New Delhi can alone use these weapons through Afghanistan-based Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and ISIS which are also being backed by RAW, CIA and Mossad, and have claimed responsibility for several terror assaults inside Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the recent ones. So, RAW’s sole aim will be to provoke Americans and its allies against Islamabad which is challenging Indian hegemony in the region. Thus, Indian RAW could create a dangerous misunderstanding in which US could use small nuclear weapons against Pakistan or could ask the latter of rollback its atomic programme.  Returning to our main discussion, question of Indian nuclear security is frightening the entire world. Therefore, by abandoning their double standards, the US-led Western countries must take serious notice of Indian proliferation of nuclear weapons and its poor nuclear security. World’s various forums such as EU and UNO, including Russia should also take cognizance of New Delhi in this regard.",INDIA,Fake
An Open Letter to Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Mr Aamir Khan ,"Dear Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Mr.Aamir Khan  As an Indian, I feel absolutely elated that Indian Film superstars such as yourselves not only enjoy the adulation and demigod status with a humongous fan-following in our country but also across a country like China which seems so alien to our culture and ethos. But it just proves that talent can transcend all borders and language does not pose any kind of barrier.  It is but natural with your popularity growing exponentially across the globe; the large corporate and marketing gurus see great potential in investing in you as brand ambassadors, so that your charisma and popularity can rub off on their brands and boost the sales of their products.  I would like to bring to your attention certain facts behind Chinese products which celebrities endorse. A word of caution, you will find the facts revolting.  Did you know China’s economic power is the result of sending innocent people who have committed no crimes but do not follow the Party’s ideologies, to forced labour camps to serve as a large scale force of free slave labour? It is estimated that more than one crore people work in thousands of forced labour camps across China. This includes a big majority of ‘political’ prisoners.  China tops the world with more than 2,300 executions per year. Remember, every time you buy a product ‘Made in China,’ you are funding and empowering a brutal regime.  A lot of Chinese goods available in the Indian market are made by prisoners under appalling conditions in what the Chinese call ‘laogai’ or labour camps. They are deprived of sleep and have to slog away without food or breaks with their hands bleeding. The shocker is that they are killed on demand for their organs that are matched and sold to the highest bidder. It is a billion dollar industry supported by the state government. The victims are mostly Falun Dafa practitioners who practice an exercise and meditation practice that promotes good health with an emphasis on improving one’s moral character  Last year during Diwali there was a public service campaign calling for Boycotting Chinese goods. It is ironical that a popular Chinese mobile phone maker sold a record one million smart phones in India in 18 days during the Diwali festive season, despite calls for boycott of Chinese goods in the country.  We all know that in today’s world since a mobile phone is an extension of oneself, one is totally handicapped without a phone. But ignoring the sordid details of what goes on behind the making of the Made in China product would be as Gandhiji said   “An evil system never deserves such allegiance. Allegiance to it means partaking of the evil. A good person will resist an evil system with his or her soul.”  70 million people practicing Falun Dafa, a peaceful spiritual practice with exercise and meditation became the soft target and are being killed on demand to supply an ongoing illegal organ transplant industry. The Chinese government ex-chief Jiang Zemin not being able to come to terms with the popularity of Falun Dafa introduced by Master Li Hongzhi in 1992 with 70 million Chinese people practicing it banned it on 20 July 1999. Since then for 18 years Falun Dafa practitioners are systematically imprisoned, tortured and killed for their organs. Their bodies are often cremated so that there is no evidence left. (Read more at www.faluninfo.net)  Chinese doctors and hospital workers admitted in recorded phone calls from undercover investigators that they have live organs from healthy Falun Dafa practitioners in prisons, available for sale.  When all over the world, patients have to wait for years for organ transplants, in China you can get it in a week’s time. Hospital web sites in China till recently advertised short waiting times for organ transplants. Due to the increase of available organs for sale in China, many foreigners travel there for transplantation.    10,000 organs are transplanted in China every year, even though China has no effective national organ donation system.                                                                                                                       I would  least like to put you in a dilemma where you can’t renege on your contracts which would cast a slur on your professionalism and integrity and neither can the Company summarily terminate the contract and suffer huge losses. What I think could be a benevolent solution is for you to make amends by making more people aware of these crimes against humanity. You can also at an opportune moment talk to the corporate decision makers or people who matter in the Chinese government to put an end to the persecution. Please do not misconstrue this as getting political. It is a moral issue- a human rights issue.  I respect your integrity and your exemplary sense of ethics, at the core of your being and it is demonstrated often when you have stood up for social causes and exposed many of society’s ills. Laudable are Amitabh Bachchan’s moral stance of not endorsing any product that has anything to do with alcohol or smoking, and the public service campaign ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ for the girl child and Aamir Khan’s ‘Satyamev Jayate’ proactive TV serial to expose corruption and social evils.  For your kind information Falun Dafa was introduced in India in the year 2000. It was officially registered in 2004 and since then the exercise and meditation practice has been introduced in schools and colleges across the length and breadth of India. Falun Dafa was well received by the Police academies in Delhi and Hyderabad. Falun Dafa adherents were invited by several large organizations to introduce it to their senior executives and interestingly Jail superintends too have requested to introduce the exercise and meditation practice to inmates.  It will be of special interest to you that in the Mumbai film industry there are many ‘behind the scene’ artistes such as hair stylists, make-up artists, Talent search agencies, photographers who have found strength in  Falun Dafa to overcome the stress of the glitz and glamour world.  Thank you for your patience and I look forward to some positive action from you.  Very truly yours  Suren Rao  President  Falun Dafa Association of India  surenrao9@unseen.is",INDIA,Fake
Line,"Shardi and Nardi, two mountain peaks, two enslaved fairies, are an integral part of the beautiful town of Sharda. Centuries ago they lived in Sharda peacefully and happily. The place was known for knowledge and learning. People travelled from across the mountains and valleys to satiate their thirst for knowledge. In those ancient times arrived a man from the world laid distantly across the difficult Banihal Pass. Soon he was known for his meek appearance but clever mind. He often lived in the world of incantation and magic. It did not take long before the man was charmed by the beauty of Shardi and Nardi. They were alien to him, but he entrapped them to go along to his world. After a short journey to the lands across the difficult passes, both Shardi and Nardi found out the devilish mysterious habits of the man and ran back scared to their own land. The man chased them, chained them but they remained unmoved by his orders. Frustrated and angered, the man cast a magic spell and turned them into objects of mud and stone. He then returned back to his lands laid detached and distant, much beyond in the deltas of Ganges. In the period of centuries, much gathered over static and stationary Shardi and Nardi. They had lost the power to converse with their kinsmen living in Sharda village but retained the consciousness to converse with each other. Gradually both found out that they could converse with another mate, Neelum. For people, Neelum was a riverine but in fact, it was living specie that found out the methods of surviving forever. Neelum was usually quiet brooding over time and destiny but occasionally conversed with the two and assured them of the freedom-days.  Decades ago, Shardi and Nardi came to know that their captor had reincarnated and crossed the difficult passes to take them to his remote lands. However, this time aware of his ill-intent, the people of the land had put a halt to his advances. A war broke out and warlock was stopped. But there he marked a line that divided the people of the land. Shardi and Nardi are waiting for centuries now, for their captor to free them, or for their kinsmen to rid them of their plight. Shardi and Nardi believe in their cause of freedom as the captor for sure is to return to his land.  Neelum looked amused that morning. Now it was a routine to find scores of travellers around Sharda and other villages nearby. Neelum knew them well as most were kinsmen of Mai Kolachi. Neelum found himself chained in love with Mai Kolachi. In centuries-old times once Neelum started his journey from the land of high mountains in search of eternity, he found out a natural course all along till he met Mai Kolachi. There he found eternity in the vast bosom of seashores and deep waters. Neelum found out that people all around were as amiable as Mai Kolachi. Though Neelum kept his abode in high mountains but got accustomed to habits, care and love of the land that led him to Mai Kolachi.  On one beautiful morning, Neelum found a beautiful girl and a young boy brooding over his wings. The girl was a painter and the boy was a poet. They have found out the power of love in a way that not only connected them profusely to each other but they could also converse with nature. The girl soon spotted Shardi and Nardi and started painting them. The boy got engaged in conversation with Neelum. He asked him the meaning of love. The question stirred the usually quiet Neelum and he replied, “Love is a dream that is chased by all and forever. Most often it is taken as an object that can be kept in one shape but in that fallacy lies the death of love”. Then Neelum almost talked to himself: “I have lived in time and found out that love never survives in ordinary sense. One cannot live forever in once charming but motionless circles. Love is a power that frees you from all chains of acceptance and non-acceptance. It is a state of soul where meanings of union and separation are no different. Love is almost like a relation of a ship and a sea. The ship has no life being stationary and outside the waters, but still it travels all over. The sea-waters never stop the ship at one point, but widens its lanes and open the arms once ship choses to stay or travel. The waters know that the ship is always in their world and would never go away.” The boy looked at the girl who was painting, and she nodded affirmatively. The poet who was always in search of ‘truth and beauty’ had found the answer of love in ‘freedom and continuity’. It appeared that he had slipped but in reality he chose to enter the waters of Neelum silently. Neelum then turned to the girl and said, “Love is not always staying together. Love is not always union. For nothing is permanent in this world of change and uncertainty. Pain and pleasure, both are love if faith is kept on freedom of choice. Betrayal or broken promises should never be mistaken for love, as oneness of souls needs no promises to be kept.” Neelum was happy to find a new companion, too. They both would travel to the land of Mai Kolachi. Neelum then asked the girl to give title to her painting ‘power of abstinence’. Silence, humility and patience are strands of abstinence that frees the man from the mysteries of want. The girl stayed sombre and completed her painting. Neelum had taught her that continuity was life.  …  Neelum and the poet started travelling and natural flow of the river was taking them to Mai Kolachi. The boy was sure that he would meet the girl there. Miles below Sharda village, Neelum and the boy reached the village Keran. There Neelum shared the story of the divided village, and a drowned girl who chose honour over ruin. Centuries after, the time had repeated the story of agony and sufferings, and this time not one man of incantation but a multitude of his kinsmen invaded the land of Shardi and Nardi. They were yelling mantras of peace but were dragging all of them to the lands they never belonged to. The winds, rivers, mountains, springs, suns and moons all travelled along Neelum to the lands of Mai Kolachi. Neelum stood their way to protect the people of Keran. But there they established a line of control on the bosom of Neelum and divided the people. Then began the story of ordeal for many Shardi and Nardi in the land that was often alluded as paradise. On that fateful day, the kinsmen of the incantation man came to the village in search of men of freedom who wanted to unite the divided village of Keran. These alien men were brutal in their methods and manners. There they found this beautiful poor girl who was no less than a fairy. They dragged her to their abode and the night of evil spread her wings. The girl looked across Neelum where laid the other part of village Keran. That was serene and peaceful as a child in the lap of a mother. The girl was engrossed in deep thoughts among the invaders. She was thinking of his people living across Neelum. They lived and moved freely like their ancestors to the lands of Mai Kolachi. Their destination was not an imposed-one rather a chosen-one. They all knew love which freed them from burdens of unwanted obligations. They also knew the meaning of life which was a continuity from times immemorial. Both their life and love always took them along the course of Neelum whose final abode along his brothers Jhelum and Chenab was the land of Mai Kolachi. They all were freed by power of love and had faith in their common destiny. The girl then made a final decision and quietly escaped from her captors. This time the captors could not stop her by their magical incantations. The girl knew that she could not swim, yet she chose to cross Neelum on an evil night. Neelum took the girl in his warm motherly arms to end her ordeal of pangs and sufferings.  …  The painter girl was going back to her home in the lands of Mai Kolachi. The boy and Neelum were travelling parallel in the same downward direction. The poor girl of divided Keran village was already in the lands of natural contiguity and instinctive affinity. No other line exists in those lands but only one: Line of Continuity that unites Mai Kolachi to the beautiful village of Sharda.Shardi and Nardi are waiting for their kinsmen to free them or, the time to end the magic spell of their alien captor.

Kashmir’s Accession to Pakistan Day ,"By Sajjad Shaukat  Preparations have started by Kashmiris living either side of the line of control and rest of the world to observe the Kashmir’s Accession to Pakistan Day on July 19, this year.  On this very day in 1947, the historical resolution was adopted by the by the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference in Abi Guzar, Srinagar during an emergency convention at the residence of Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan. It was presided over by Chaudhry Hamid Ullah Khan, and the resolution was presented by Khawaja Ghulam-ud-Din Wani and Abdul Rahim Wani, with 59 prominent leaders in attendance.  The resolution was unanimously adopted, 19, 1947 showing a political and constitutional stance. It indicated that existing religious, geographical, cultural, economic ties and the aspirations of millions of Kashmiri Muslims warrant accession of the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) with Pakistan. During the partition of the Sub-continent, the people of the state of Jammu and Kashmir which comprised Muslim majority decided to join Pakistan according to the British-led formula. But, Dogra Raja, Sir Hari Singh, a Hindu who was ruling over the J&K in connivance with the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Governor General Lord Mountbatten joined India.  The design to forcibly wrest Kashmir began to unfold on August 16, 1947, with the announcement of the Radcliffe Boundary Award. It gave the Gurdaspur District—a majority Muslim area to India to provide a land route to the Indian armed forces to move into Kashmir. There was a rebellion in the state forces, which revolted against the Maharaja and were joined by Pathan tribesmen. Lord Mountbatten ordered armed forces to land in Srinagar.  However, Indian forces invaded Srinagar on 27 October 1947 and forcibly occupied Jammu and Kashmir in utter violation of the partition plan and against the wishes of the Kashmiri people.  When Pakistan responded militarily against the Indian aggression, on December 31, 1947, India made an appeal to the UN Security Council to intervene and a ceasefire ultimately came into effect on January 01, 1949, following UN resolutions calling for a plebiscite in Kashmir.  It is mentionable that the Security Council adopted resolution 47 (1948) of 21 April 1948 which promised a plebiscite under UN auspices to enable the people of Jammu and Kashmir to determine whether they wish to join Pakistan or India. On February 5, 1964, India backed out of its promise of holding plebiscite. Instead, in March 1965, the Indian Parliament passed a bill, declaring Kashmir a province of India-an integral part of the Indian union.  The very tragedy of Kashmiris had started after 1947 when they were denied their genuine right of self-determination. They organised themselves against the injustices of India and launched a war of liberation which New Delhi tried to suppress through various forms of state terrorism.  It is notable that since 1947, in order to maintain its illegal control, India has continued its repressive regime in the Occupied Kashmir through various machinations such as establishment of puppet governments etc.  Ironically, despite a lapse of 67 years, Kashmiris are still struggling and sacrificing to achieve their alienable right under the UN resolutions. Kashmir Valley is one of the most heavily militarized regions in the world with Indian 7 million armed security forces which are perpetrating various forms of state terrorism on the innocent Kashmiris. Since 1989, a deliberate campaign by the Indian army and paramilitary forces against the Kashmiris has been manifested in brutal tactics such as crackdowns, curfews, illegal detentions, massacre, targeted killings, sieges, burning the houses, torture, disappearances, rape, breaking the legs, molestation of Muslim women and killing of persons through fake encounters.  According to a report on human rights violations in the Indian Occupied Kashmir, since 1989, there have been deaths of 1,00000 innocent Kashmiris, 7,023 custodial killings, 1,22,771 arrests, 1,05,996 destruction of houses or buildings, 22,776 women widowed, 1,07,466 children orphaned and 10,086 women gang-raped/molested. Indian brutal securities forces have continue these atrocities.  Besides Human Rights Watch, in its various reports, Amnesty International has also pointed out grave human rights violations in the Indian controlled Kashmir, indicating, “The Muslim majority population in the Kashmir Valley suffers from the repressive tactics of the security forces. Under the Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act, and the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act and Public Safety Act, security forces personnel have extraordinary powers to shoot suspected persons.”  In its report on July 2, 2015, the Amnesty International has highlighted extrajudicial killings of the innocent persons at the hands of Indian security forces in the Indian Held Kashmir. The report points out, “Tens of thousands of security forces are deployed in Indian-administered Kashmir…the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) allows troops to shoot to kill suspected militants or arrest them without a warrant…not a single member of the armed forces has been tried in a civilian court for violating human rights in Kashmir…this lack of accountability has in turn facilitated other serious abuses…India has martyred one 100,000 people. More than 8,000 disappeared (while) in the custody of army and state police.”  In this respect, European Union passed a resolution on May 11, 2011 about human rights abuses committed by Indian forces in the Indian held Kashmir.  Particularly, in 2008, a rights group reported unnamed graves in various regions of the Indian occupied Kashmir. In this connection, in August, 2011, Indian Jammu and Kashmir State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) officially acknowledged in its report that innocent civilians killed in the two-decade conflict have been buried in unmarked graves. Notably, foreign sources and human rights organizations including Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP) have disclosed that unnamed graves include thousands of persons, killed by the Indian forces in the fake encounters including those who were tortured to death by Indian secret agency RAW.  In its report China’s leading News Agency Xinhua has unearthed more gruesome details on world-stunning unmarked graves in Poonch of the Indian occupied Kashmir. The report revealed the statement of Sofi Aziz Joo, caretaker of a graveyard as saying, “Police and Army used to bring those bodies and direct me to bury them. The bodies were usually bullet-ridden, mutilated, faces disfigured and sometimes without limbs and heads.”  It seems that non-condemnation of these Indian massive human rights violations and non-interference for the settlement of this issue by the so-called civilized international community, especially the US have further encouraged New Delhi to keep on going with its state terrorism on the armless Kashmiri masses. Ignorance of the issue by them involves the risk of nuclear war between Pakistan and India.  Indian authorities are not willing to talk with Kashmiri people on political grounds. New Delhi reached to a conclusion that only bullet is the right way of dealing with Kashmiris, demanding their right of self-determination. Surprisingly, Indian successive governments are trying to ignore the dynamics of the freedom movement of Kashmiris for the sake of their alien rule.  It is noteworthy that dialogue between India and Pakistan took place on a number of occasions, but produced no outcome, prolonging the agony of the subjugated people of the occupied Kashmir due to Indian intransigence.  It is worth-mentioning that since the martyrdom of Burhan Wani, Commander of Hizb ul Mujahideen by the Indian security forces on July 8, 2017, New Dehi has accelerated state terrorism throughout the Indian Controlled Kashmir. As a result more than 200 people embraced martyrdom and around 20,000 got injured. Many became permanently blind due to pellet guns shots. Curfew remained imposed for more than four months. Around 12,000 people were arrested or detained.  Nevertheless, every year, the Kashmiris and their brethren in Pakistan, and those living all over the world observe 19th July as the ‘Accession to Pakistan Day’ to re-affirm their commitment to continue their struggle against Indian illicit occupation, and till the attainment of this liberation.

Kashmir: Martyrs’ Day Revisited ,"By Sajjad Shaukat  Every year, Kashmir Martyrs’ Day” is commemorated on July 13 in the memory of 21 Kashmiris who were martyred outside Srinagar Central Jail by the troops of Dogra Maharaja on July 13, 1931. This heinous incident took place on that day when people had gathered to witness the court proceedings against Abdul Qadeer who was charged for instigating Kashmiris to defy Dogra rule. The very day is observed on both sides of the Line of Control and all over the world by the Kashmiris to pay homage to these Kashmiris. The day is the milestone in the history, as it has given a new impetus to the Kashmir’s struggle for independence in wake of Indian state terrorism which has continued in the Indian Occupied Kashmir, and has converting every day into Martyrs’ day for the Kashmiris.  However, the history of Dogra rule (1846-1947) in Kashmir is replete with tyrannous treatment, meted out to the Kashmiri Muslims by Dogra forces. Under the Dogra rule, they were leading so miserable life that it was difficult to differentiate them from beasts. Slave labour, heavy taxes, capital punishment for cow slaughter, and living under constant terror was order of the day.  In this regard, Yousaf Saraf in his book, “Kashmiris Fight for Freedom” calls it “free forced labour” and “instead of donkeys and horses, Kashmiri Muslims were used for transportation of goods across the far-flung areas.” In this context, while describing the pathetic picture of the Kashmiris, in his book, “The India We Served”, Sir Walter Lawrence writes, “Army was employed in forcing the villagers to plough and sow, and worse still, the soldiers came at harvest time and when the share of the state had been seized” and “there was very little grain to tide the unfortunate peasants over the cruel winter.”  On April 19, 1931, the ban of Eid Khutba (Sermon) ignited widespread demonstrations in the Jummu city for a number of days. It was followed by desecration of the Holy Quran at the hands of Dogra forces, which resulted into outrage among the Muslims throughout the state. In Srinagar, people gathered in Jamia Masjid to denounce this blasphemy. One such get-together was held in Khankah-e-Muella Srinagar, which was addressed by prominent Kashmiris. When the meeting was concluded, a youth, Abdul Qadeer, pointing his finger to the Maharaja’s palace, raised slogans “destroy its every brick.” With the accusation of sedition, he was arrested forthwith. Abdul Qadir was to be tried in the court, but due to large public resentment, the court was shifted to Central Jail Srinagar.  On July 12, 1931, in response to the shifting of court, intense public protests were held throughout the city. The next day, on July 13, 1931, thousands of people thronged the Central Jail Srinagar to witness the in-camera trial of Abdul Qadeer. As the time for obligatory prayer approached, a young Kashmiri stood for Azan. The Dogra Governor, Ray Zada Tartilok Chand ordered soldiers to open fire at him. When he got martyred, another young man took his place and started Azan. He was also shot dead. In this way, 21 Kashmiris embraced martyrdom in their efforts to complete the Azan. The people carried the dead and paraded through the streets of Srinagar, chanting slogans against Dogra brutalities. Complete strike was observed in the city, which was followed by weeklong mourning. This incident shook the whole state and the traffic from Srinagar to Rawalpindi and Srinagar to Jammu came to halt from July 13 to 26, 1931. The 21 martyrs are buried in Martyrs’ Graveyard at Khawaja Bazar, Srinagar.  Consequently, upon these brutal killings, the Kashmiri leadership realized the need to form a political party, Muslim Conference (MC) with a view to waging struggle for their freedom. Later, in 1934, state’s first elections were held and MC won 10 out of 21 seats, and after two years in 1936, it succeeded in getting 19 out of 21 seats. Indian Congress was upset with this situation and tried to create division in the ranks of Kashmiri leadership. Afterwards, on July 19, 1947, MC passed a resolution to merge Kashmir with Pakistan, considering the geographical proximity—majority of Muslim population (77%), language and cultural relations of Jammu and Kashmir.  Ironically, despite a lapse of 66 years, Kashmiris are still struggling and sacrificing to achieve their alienable right under the UN resolutions for the plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir. Kashmir Valley is one of the most heavily militarized regions in the world with Indian 7 million armed security forces which are perpetrating various forms of state terrorism on the innocent Kashmiris. Since 1989, a deliberate campaign by the Indian army and paramilitary forces against the Kashmiris has been manifested in brutal tactics such as crackdowns, curfews, illegal detentions, massacre, targeted killings, sieges, burning the houses, torture, disappearances, rape, breaking the legs, molestation of Muslim women and killing of persons through fake encounter.

It is notable that dialogue between India and Pakistan took place on a number of occasions, but produced no outcome, prolonging the agony of the subjugated people of the occupied Kashmir due to Indian intransigence.  Nevertheless, observance of Kashmiris’ freedom struggle during the Martyrs’ Day, every year is reaffirmation of the fact that Kashmiris will continue to fight against Indian illicit occupation. In this context, Youme Shuhada-e-Kashmir is an ideal day for Kashmiris to seek inspiration to take their war of liberation to its logical end. At this time of distress, the people of Pakistan’s side are sharing the grief of Kashmiri freedom lovers. Pakistan also observes Youme Shudaha-e-Kashmir on July 13, launching a protest against the oppressive polices of Indian occupation, which have continued against the hapless Kashmiris.  Nonetheless, on July 13, all over the world, Kashmiris renew their pledge to continue the ongoing war of liberation for the accomplishment of their right of self-determination and for the independence of Kashmir from the despotic Indian rulers who continue state terrorism in the Indian-controlled Kashmir like the Dogra rulers. In these terms, every Day is Martyrs’ Day in Kashmir.

Lessons From The Biggest Blue Wave of the 2018 Election ,"Colorado used to be a reliably Republican state — but in this midterm election, progressives engineered a full and complete takeover of the entire state government. Democrats won the governorship, the state House, the State Senate, and every statewide constitutional office. It was the first time in at least 80 years Democrats have had this kind of power in Colorado. On this episode, I talked to Ian Silverii of the progressive Colorado group ProgressNow. We discussed how progressives engineered their big night in Colorado, and what lessons there are for other states. We also discussed how the oil and gas industry spent roughly $40 million to defeat ballot measures designed to reduce drilling and fracking.

Jeff Flake Considers Running Against Trump ,"Does This Look Presidential  The race for President in 2020 is off and running with candidates floating trial balloons to see if they have any support. This includes members of Donald Trump’s own party.  According to Politico  Jeff Flake said Friday that a Republican needs to challenge Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2020. And it might be him.  Flake gave at least some credence to the widespread speculation that he might mount a quixotic primary campaign against Trump, given the retiring senator’s public fretting about the state of the party. The Arizona GOP senator, who has visited New Hampshire recently, is decidedly keeping his name out there.  Find Out More >  55,187 “I’ve not ruled it out. I’ve not ruled it in. Just, somebody needs to run on the Republican side,” Flake said on Friday in a lengthy conversation with POLITICO and The Hill on Friday. Flake said both outgoing Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Nebraska GOP Sen. Ben Sasse could give Trump a credible challenge.  Flake insisted that Trump’s popularity in the party is ruining the GOP’s long-term viability and predicted only a brutal electoral loss could make that clear.  “I hope somebody does [run], just to remind Republicans what it means to be conservative and what it means to be decent. We’ve got to bring that back,” Flake said. “You can whip up the base for a cycle or two but it wears thin. Anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy.”  Dismissing what Flake says here out of hand is probably a huge mistake. Presidents that have serious contenders within their party usually do not win reelection.  President Ford vs Governor Reagan 1976 ( Ford loses to Cater)  President Carter vs Senator Ted Kennedy 1980 ( Cater loses to Reagan)  President Bush 41 vs Pat Buchanan 1992 ( Bush loses to Clinton with the help of third-party candidate Ross Perot)  When the press mentions the anger that is directed at President Trump they usually mention Democrats. Yet there is a strong group of Republicans that you could say have never forgotten the primaries in 2016 and would not mind seeing Trump fall to save the party, country or their pocketbooks for another election cycle.  Also while the election results from last Tuesday are still being broken down there are signs that the Republican party is in danger of going through the electoral desert on a horse with no name for a while. My colleague here at Red State covered why in this excellent piece earlier this week, Election Reflection: Forget The Spin, Danger Lies Ahead For Republicans.  I personally don’t think Jeff Flake has it in him to go through the grind of a national run AND take fire from Donald Trump in a way that only the President can deliver. He had two ladies rattle him at an elevator and he folded on supporting Kavanaugh from the yelling and flying spittle.  Gov. John Kasich though won’t be deterred that easy in my opinion. He has been chomping at the bit to take a piece out of Trump and John does not want to wait until 2024 to tell us once again that his Dad was a mailman.  However, this starts to unfold all sides that do not like Donald J Trump believe they smell blood in the water and they are coming. I look forward to seeing how this all unfolds.

Trump Now Taking Down the Federal Reserve System ,"In 1913 the Federal Reserve System was created to steal wealth from around the world by the Elite Rothchild Banking System centered in Frankfurt, Germany  Along with the Masons these Dirty Little Demon Possessed Individuals formented 2 World Wars and are now trying to forment a third world war.  The Goal here is to reduce the Human Population to 500 Million People, Create Total Anarchy, and bring in Lucifer’s Teacher – the Satanic Jesus – to unite the planet.  When the Federal Reserve System was created so ast the Make America Great Corporation p to oppose them.  In 2007 the Russians and Chinese, working with the Make America Great Again, began working to replace this Lucifarian System – which funds the Rothchilds, with a system based in St Petersbug, Russia    The System will use Super Computers like Titan and Titan 2 to control international Trade and create a World Wide Gold Backed System.  Funny – Since we all watched our Prefessors at US Berkeley grow Iran in 1977 in a Metalurgy 101 class.

College Students Given Dedicated Space to “Process” Election Results ,"It would appear that Elmhurst College in Illinois has made a couple of assumptions about their students.

Does Kevin McCarthy Really Have House GOP Leader Sewed Up?,"President Donald Trump, right, accompanied by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., speaks to members of the media as they arrive for a dinner at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., Sunday, Jan. 14, 2018. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  With the retirement of Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy was considered a shoo-in for Speaker or House Minority Leader. The GOP’s loss of the House on Tuesday has given impetus to a small scale mutiny. Ohio Representative and Freedom Caucus stalwart Jim Jordan has declared his intent to run for caucus leadership.  Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on Wednesday said that House Republicans must prepare to defend President Trump from potential investigations launched by House Democrats, saying he doubts there will be much bipartisan effort.  “I don’t think so,” Jordan told Hill.TV’s Buck Sexton on “Rising” when asked if there would be an effort from House Democrats to reach across the aisle.  “I think they’re going to investigate the heck out of the first family. I think there will be impeachment proceedings. Mr. Cummings has talked about that on the Oversight Committee. Mr. Nadler has talked about that. He’ll be the next chair of the Judiciary Committee,” he continued.  Find Out More >  56,253 “And Adam Schiff has said the same thing as the next chair of the Intelligence Committee, so I think it’s important we stand up and defend the White House and the president, and push back on some of these things that we know are going to happen,” he said.  .@Jim_Jordan announces bid for House minority leader: “We have to stand up and defend the White House. We have to stand up and work with the president over these next two years.” https://t.co/xTkhMTGUtU pic.twitter.com/ylpoBA1MN5  — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) November 8, 2018  McCarthy, for his part, says the election is locked up.  In his first interview since Tuesday’s drubbing — Democrats racked up their biggest House win since the Watergate scandal — McCarthy on Friday said the GOP will have to learn from its mistakes this past cycle. But he insisted that Republicans can get back in the majority in 2020, despite an unpopular, unpredictable president sitting in the Oval Office. And McCarthy asserted he is the right person to lead them there.  “I had the votes the first day,” McCarthy said of the race to become minority leader. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a hardline conservative who helped found the House Freedom Caucus, is running against McCarthy. House Republicans will choose their new leaders on Nov. 14.  Is that true. One of the basic rules of leadership elections is that no votes are locked up until they are counted. In fact, the loss Tuesday has made McCarthy’s job a lot harder. Not only is the caucus more right-leaning than the current Congress:  For anyone who doubted the post-Labor Day consolidation of the Trump base: Dems didn’t flip a single GOP House seat where Trump broke 55% of the vote.  — Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) November 7, 2018  I think everyone knows that the new environment calls for more of a street fighter like Newt Gingrich than a go-along-get-along happy loser like Bob Michel. I’ve not seen any visible signs that McCarthy really understands what fresh hell is coming his way in January or that he has the gonads, guts or gumption to fight the trench and guerrilla warfare that the situation will require.  McCarthy may very well win. If he does, I’m not convinced that he is the man the GOP will need for the next two years in the House.  ========= ========= Like what you see?

Wall Street Journal: Gab To Rein In Calls For Violence While Allowing Hate Speech ,"This is the same Wall Street Journal “journalist” who went after Killstream:  “The social-media site where the alleged Pittsburgh synagogue shooter broadcast his intentions is pledging to curb threats of violence, while it said it plans to remain a platform where hate speech and other forms of extreme content are permitted.  Gab.com, which resumed service this week after a stretch in digital exile, will proactively police the site rather than wait for users to report troubling posts, founder Andrew Torba said in an interview, vowing to bolster efforts to expunge threats of physical harm. …  Since Monday, Gab has permanently banned 200 accounts for repeatedly violating its guidelines around threats of violence, Mr. Torba said. Gab prohibits calling for “acts of violence against others” as well as threatening language that “clearly, directly and incontrovertibly infringes on the safety of another user.” It also removed more than 1,000 posts that threatened violence and hadn’t been reported by users. He said the banned users weren’t notified, but he is working to add more transparency to the process. …”  The big takeaway is confirmation of 200 permanent bans.  Find Out More >  56,507 Before the Pittsburgh shooting, there were two high profile bans on Gab of Weev and Paul Nehlen. Since Pittsburgh, there have been 200 permanent bans since Monday. Presumably, even more users were permanently banned during the downtime last week because lots of accounts were already noticeably missing when Gab came back online last weekend.  For the record, I have no objection to the “no promotion of violence, but hate speech is fine” standard. That’s the same standard which I have adopted here at Occidental Dissent. I’m not running a free speech website though. This is my own personal nationalist blog. From what I saw on Gab, it isn’t clear that everyone who was purged was even posting violent speech. I could be wrong on this point, but it caught my eye that accounts which I had never considered edge posters were purged.  So, what to do? “Journalists” and Antifa have now signed up accounts on Gab for the sole purpose of reporting posts to nuke accounts. These bans have already had a chilling effect on Gab. They have cancelled out the major advantage that Gab had over Twitter and Facebook which was that users could network and post there without having to deal with those people abusing the moderation system. If we have to deal with them on Gab, why not just deal with them on Facebook and Twitter?  In some form, we’re going to be returning to Facebook and Twitter now. I’m not exactly sure how to do this at the moment. I plan to figure it out over the weekend though.",POLITICS,Fake

I would direct you to really watch the :05 second mark pic.twitter.com/kEkfxswwbB  Find Out More >  57,186 — Benny (@bennyjohnson) November 8, 2018  There followed a whole boomlet of claims that the White House had “edited” the video even though independent experts (click the link for Brandon Morse’s post) and administration-hostile sources like Buzzfeed said nothing of the kind happened. But, at least, some of those claiming the video had been altered were acting in uninformed good-faith, the same can’t be said for CNN.  Jim Acosta made a beeline for Anderson Cooper’s local-access cable show to complain about the injustice of it all.  Acosta said on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360” that he was “trying to hang onto the microphone” when he was approached by the intern, who tried to take his microphone away as he attempted to ask a question of Trump during a White House press briefing.  “I didn’t put my hands on her or touch her as they’re alleging. It’s unfortunate the White House is saying this,” Acosta said on CNN. “I think I handled myself professionally.”  Yes, Jim Acosta was handling himself professionally in the same way Paul “Pee Wee Herman” Reubens was professionally watching the triple feature of Catalina Five-O Tiger Shark, Nurse Nancy, and Turn Up the Heat.  What was incredible about the episode was not that Acosta lied, that’s what sociopaths do, but that Anderson Cooper and CNN’s management decided to go along with it.  In this 3:24 segment, as Acosta is lying his butt off, Anderson Cooper reads tweets from Acosta’s admirers and allies. They never actually play the video of the incident. They cue up the altercation at 1:54 but cut the clip before the incident.  Acosta was way out of line both in his professional conduct (yes, I peed myself a little bit writing that) and his lack of manhood. Treating a young woman who is just doing her job like that is unforgivable. His press pass should be pulled and CNN told that it will never be restored. But what about CNN? This is an ostensible news organization blatantly lying to cover for an employee that was 100% in the wrong, personally and professionally? If they will lie about little crap like this, is there anything they won’t lie about?",POLITICS,Fake
President Trump Blocks Caravans From Requesting Asylum With Executive Order ,"As promised, the Trump administration has released the executive order to deal with the caravans:  “WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, invoking national security powers meant to protect the United States against threats from abroad, announced new rules on Thursday that give President Trump vast authority to deny asylum to virtually any migrant who crosses the border illegally.  Administration officials declined to say who will be affected by the new rules, but it is widely expected inside the government and by advocate groups that Mr. Trump intends to deny asylum to migrants from Central American nations, some of whom are marching toward the United States in a widely publicized caravan. …”  In theory, the executive order will force illegal aliens seeking asylum to come in through a port of entry like San Ysidro where the last well publicized caravan crossed the border. This is undoubtedly about to get litigated by the ACLU and lawyers from a bunch of different groups in the federal courts.  President Trump isn’t wrong about our terrible immigration laws which limit what he can do here. It is up to Congress to change those laws, but the Republican majority in Congress didn’t want to do so. Mitch McConnell has refused to change the filibuster which has killed off any chances of passing controversial legislation in the Senate without attaining a nearly impossible hurdle of 60 votes.  Find Out More >  57,321 The caravans will likely cross the border at a port of entry, request asylum and be housed in the tent cities that Trump was talking about at his recent press conference. Whether they will stay there or be released like the others after some federal court decision remains to be seen.  NPI has grown tired of this and wants to move on:  The likelihood that Trump will accomplish anything meaningful during the remainder of his term is low.

Florida Politician Uses Twitter to Encourage Vote Fraud ,"Right now, Democrat run elections boards in the Florida counties of Palm Beach and Broward Counties are in the process of literally stealing the races for senator and governor. Literally. And without even an attempt at artifice and concealment. They are stealing the election and they are rubbing our collective noses in it. While the elections officials in those counties are directly to blame, it is clear a culture of lawlessness runs deep in those counties.  In Florida’s 18th district, a so-called battleground district where Republican Brian Mast is holding a seat previously held by Democrat Patrick Murphy, Mast has a 9-point lead–some 30,000 votes–over challenger Lauren Baer. That should be it, one would think. But you’d think wrong.  Yesterday, Baer’s primary opponent, perennial candidate Pam Keith sent out this passionate, and since deleted, tweet:    Find Out More >  57,365 The reason why she deleted brings to mind an epic scene from the television series The Wire where drug lord Stringer Bell has tried to teach Robert’s Rules of Order to his underlings:    The fact that someone with at law degree would put that message out on Twitter shows the extent to which that corruption has become endemic in South Florida elections. Ironically, Rick Scott had the ability to clean some of this crap up when he was governor and he elected to not do so. What seems to me to be needed is a massive intervention by the US Department of Justice on the same level as it employed to stamp out voter suppression in the Civil Rights era. Nothing less than a federal takeover of Broward and Palm Beach County voting operations and the firing of most, if not all, of the permanent staff there will be able to restore democracy.  ========= ========= Like what you see?

Water Cooler 11/9/18 Open Thread – It’s Bigger Than An Election  Invention of the Week ,"Hello RedStaters, and Thank God Its’ Friday!  May this Water Cooler find you at peace and with a healthy sense of perspective as the world turns.  Just like last week, a worldly drama plays out around us, with examples of human achievement and failure; self sacrifice, and evil.  Same stuff, different week.  Such it has been, and such it will be until our God wraps this up.  Just like last week, our salvation is not in the works of men, or in our governments, or in our systems.  Our salvation will come only from our turning to the One who has the power to remake us and clean up the mess that we have made doing it our way, versus His.  Just like last week, we have the opportunity to look to Him for our salvation, or look elsewhere.  Just like last week, this is an individual choice that each of us must make.  What plays on around us is just showing us reflections of both our individual choices and the aggregate results thereof.  What can we do?  Each of us has fallen short of the holiness of our God.  We need to turn from our ways, and to His ways, putting our faith in the only One who ever earned it.  And then as God remakes our hearts, we can consider how we can best help turn our neighbors, friends, and nation to Him as well.  Remember John Adams:  Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.  We can only sustain freedoms to the degree that we are that people.  To the degree that we are not that people, we will continue to lose freedom.

Would it be stereotypical to think that the invention is Swiss?  Well.  It was.  Per wikipedia:  The earliest credible evidence for a successful design is the watch made by the Swiss watchmaker Abraham-Louis Perrelet, who lived in Le Locle. In late 1776 or early 1777, he invented a self-winding mechanism for pocket watches using an oscillating weight inside the watch that moved up and down.  Our inventor is quite the self-starter [also wikipedia]:  At the age of twenty years he gave up his modest work to learn watchmaking. After an apprenticeship of fifteen days at one named Prince, in Le Locle, who worked little and very badly, and where he learnt absolutely nothing, he started to work independently and so became his own master.

Men Form Human Shield Around Women to Protect them From Gunman During California Shooting ,"In a stunning act of selflessness, a group of men formed a protective wall around a group of young women in order to shield them from bullets during California’s deadly shooting that claimed the lives of 12 people.  According to the Daily Signal, three women gave an interview to ABC after the event and told the harrowing story:  “While we were all dog-piled at the side, there were multiple men that got on their knees and pretty much blocked all of us with their backs towards the shooter, ready to take a bullet for any single one of us,” Teylor Whittler, woman who had been in the club during the shooting, said Thursday morning, via ABC News.  “And just the amount of people who made sure everyone got out OK or if they were out … they made sure, they went around to every single person around them and asked them if they were OK and if they needed a phone to call their family … just in general any way they could help. It was awesome,” she continued.

Wow! Two Major Changes in the WH! Special Report: Jeff Sessions Resigns as Attorney General. New Person Overseeing the Russia Investigation (Video) ,"Following the receipt of a resignation letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, President Trump has announced that Matthew G. Whitaker, Chief of Staff to Sessions at the Department of Justice, will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States.  Special Report: Jeff Sessions resigns as Attorney General NBC News    Jeff Sessions Out As Attorney General After Steady Drumbeat Of Criticism From Trump Jeff Sessions, the president’s earliest and most fervent supporter in Congress, stepped down as attorney general Wednesday after brutal criticism from the president, bringing an abrupt end to his controversial tenure as the nation’s top law enforcement officer.  President Trump wrote on Twitter after a marathon press conference at the White House that Sessions was out and that Sessions’ chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, would serve as an acting replacement.  Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... Sessions, 71, lasted not quite two years in the job. But in that brief period, the former Alabama senator managed to usher in a new era at the Justice Department.  Sen. Jeff Sessions: Loyal To Trump, Defined By Race And Immigration  Sessions threatened so-called sanctuary cities with the loss of federal funding and announced a “zero tolerance policy” for people who cross the southern U.S. border illegally.  He decried a looming wave of violent crime across the country, even though criminologists maintain murders and assaults remain near historic lows in most places.  In His First Year As Attorney General, Sessions Transforms Justice In Key Ways  He ordered federal prosecutors to seek the most serious charges and stiff prison sentences against drug criminals, a stark reversal of former President Barack Obama’s most prominent and bipartisan justice policy.  He presided over a rollback in investigations of local police. He rescinded policies that directed federal prosecutors to go after only the biggest cases involving marijuana in states where the drug is legal. And he recommitted to using private prisons for U.S. inmates and detainees.  Who's The Real Jeff Sessions? Two Hearings In 1986 Show A Conflicting Picture  A long fuse  The seeds of Sessions’ departure were planted, ironically, during his confirmation hearing. Sessions went out of his way to deny meeting with Russians in the course of the 2016 presidential campaign. His former colleagues in the Senate approved the nomination 52 to 47, despite concerns about allegations of racial insensitivity and hostility to civil rights in his past.  But Sessions soon ran into trouble.  He was forced to correct his Senate testimony, to indicate he had, in fact, met with the Russian ambassador at least twice in 2016. Democrats on Capitol Hill accused him of making false statements. The disclosure provoked intense public scrutiny of his actions.  U.S. Intercepts Reportedly Contradict Attorney General On Russia Contacts  By March of 2017, Sessions fielded questions almost daily about whether he could oversee the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into Russian interference in the election, given his vocal role in the campaign, in which he even donned a “Make America Great Again” hat to support Donald Trump.  Ultimately, after consulting with DOJ ethics officials, Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. He cited longstanding rules regarding conflicts that arise when authorities investigate campaigns in which they participate.  The recusal decision was hailed by Democrats and good government groups. The president had a different reaction.  Two sources familiar with the situation have told NPR President Trump raged, sometimes profanely, in phone and face-to-face conversations with Sessions. It didn’t take long for Trump to voice open regret, on social media an in interviews, about having nominated Sessions.  The president grew even more antagonistic when Sessions’ deputy, Rod Rosenstein, appointed a special counsel to lead the Russia investigation after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.  Trump called the DOJ Russia probe a “witch hunt” and cast aspersions on its leader, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, a registered Republican. Trump’s allies produced an ad attacking Mueller’s team for donating to Democratic political campaigns.  All the while, Sessions ducked questions on the matter, given his recusal.  But as Mueller hired more than two dozen staff members and prosecutors, with experience in corporate fraud, money laundering, organized crime and executive privilege, Trump exploded. He denigrated Sessions, Rosenstein, Mueller and the entire post-Watergate practice of law enforcement independence from the White House in an interview with the New York Times.  “Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,” Trump said.  Too Close For Comfort: Insiders Worry About DOJ Lawyers Speaking At White House  Former Justice Department veterans said those remarks reflected a deep misunderstanding of the culture at the Justice Department and the FBI — which try to insulate their work from politics — and a sense that Trump was acknowledging he wanted his attorney general to protect him in the Russia investigation, not get to the bottom of the matter.  The issue gnawed at Trump, who days later issued a series of early morning tweets on July 22, 2017, wondering why Democrat Hillary Clinton and Comey were not under investigation for unspecified offenses. He repeated the question on July 24, 2017, referring to Sessions as “our beleaguered A.G.”  The political establishment in Washington, D.C., began wondering aloud how long Sessions could keep his job. At first, former colleagues in the Senate mobilized and came to his aid, defending his integrity.  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters, “If Jeff Sessions is fired, there will be holy hell to pay.” Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted “no way” would he hold confirmation hearings for a new attorney general in 2017.  Attacks On Sessions Could Be A Red Line For GOP Senators   For his part, Sessions told Tucker Carlson of Fox News that the barbs from Trump had been “hurtful” but that he served at the pleasure of the president.  Attorney general of everything else  Sessions kept working. He flew to El Salvador for a series of anti-gang meetings in late July 2017. There, the attorney general told graduates of a law enforcement academy that he was “blessed” to serve as the highest justice official in the United States.  “It is an honor I never expected nor one I ever would have thought possible,” Sessions said. “And while there are good days and bad days in any job, one thing has been clear to me, it is a privilege to serve one’s country in law enforcement to wake up each morning and fight the fight for the rule of law.”  And Sessions continued to set the broad priorities of the Justice Department, including a crackdown on illegal immigration and support for cases of religious liberty — although those priorities sometimes came into conflict.  His boss, Trump, appeared to have less respect for the legal system. After the special counsel unsealed indictments against his onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort deputy Richard Gates on Oct. 30, 2017, Trump insisted there was “no collusion” with Russia and reiterated his view that the investigation was a waste of time.  In early November 2017, Trump told reporters, “a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.” He said he was “frustrated” he could not direct DOJ or the FBI to take action in specific cases, remarks that Justice Department veterans consider a serious breach.  At the same time, questions about Sessions’ conduct during the campaign resurfaced after a guilty plea by onetime foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos.  Papadopoulos told prosecutors that he tried to set up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign, and that he mentioned it at a March 2016 meeting attended by both Trump and Sessions.    Attorney General Jeff Sessions is worn in before testyfying at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on November 14, 2017, in Washington, D.C.  “These facts appear to contradict your sworn testimony on several occasions,” Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee pointed out in a letter to the attorney general.  'My Story Has Never Changed,' Attorney General Jeff Sessions Tells House Committee  ‘My Story Has Never Changed,’ Attorney General Jeff Sessions Tells House Committee Sessions would get another chance on Capitol Hill to explain what he did in 2016 and how it related to Russia. In essence, he argued, he had a memory lapse, and recent news accounts of the Papadopoulos plea refreshed his recollection.  ",POLITICS,Fake
"Yes, the Democrats Flipped the House but That May Not Be the Big Story for the Next Congress ","As best I can tell right now the GOP lost 32 House seats last night (241 in the 115th Congress down to 209 in the 116th). This flips the control of the House to the Democrats. As I said earlier, make no mistake about it, this is a loss that I would rather not have suffered but in was not a shock. The average mid-term loss to the president’s party is 30 seats and this was a meh? election not a wave election.  The real story is in the Senate.  As I write this, the GOP held onto battleground seats in Tennessee and Arizona, they lost Nevada, they flipped Indiana, Missouri, and North Dakota. Florida is heading to a recount with Rick Scott in the lead (I think he’ll hang on). Jon Tester may hold onto his seat in Montana when all votes are finally counted (suddenly large numbers of ballots from Democrat strongholds are appearing). The GOP seems certain to gain four and maybe five seats from last night.  What makes this significant is that the last time a president’s party gained seats in the Senate in a midterm was 2002 when George W. Bush had one pickup. Before him, Nixon gained two seats in 1970 and JFK added 4 in 1962. So while the party occupying the presidency losing seats in midterms is sort of baked in, the same is even more true of the Senate. If Matt Rosendale does hold in in Montana to give the GOP five wins, it will be second only to FDR’s 1934 gain of 9 seats.  Find Out More >  39,594 The addition of as many as four seats to the thin one seat majority means that Mitch McConnell can afford to ignore Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. It means that the confirmation of conservative jurists will be easier. It means that the selection of cabinet officials, particularly someone to replace Jeff Sessions, will allow for more conservative candidates to win confirmation. With the absence of McCain and Flake and Corker, the Senate is less likely to sign onto any bogus “comprehensive immigration reform” not only because the Democrat House demands will be bat**** crazy but because the GOP caucus is less immigration friendly than it was in the last two Congresses.  What happened last night in the House was a set back. But whatever we lost in the House, we made up for by increasing a Senate majority and moving the Senate GOP caucus a little further to the right. And that is important.",POLITICS,Fake

It wasn’t that she was a terrible, out-of-touch candidate who campaigned in all the wrong areas.  It is the alt-right, QAnon, and online trolls and racists who are keeping the Republicans in power, not the voters that Democrats actively alienate rather than try to reach out to and compromise with.  It is not their fault, ever, that they lose.  So, clearly, we must redraw state borders. For the good of America.",POLITICS,Fake

Supreme Court Endorses Political Corruption ,"High Court Endorses Political Corruption  By Mustang  Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts was underwhelming in his acceptance of the so-called Obama Healthcare Plan. It is a tax, he said, and the federal government is permitted under the Constitution to tax the bejesus out of the American people. Well, no conservative he, and I personally think he was stretching a bit to find that the ACA was constitutional. It was, after all, far more than a tax. I conclude that Judge Roberts, like everyone in congress who voted for it, never read the law before he made his decision. Well, what did we expect? He was a Bush appointee.  But Roberts really outdid himself in the McDonnell Decision.  One may recall that while serving as Governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell solicited a fifty-thousand-dollar loan from Jonnie R. Williams. He then texted an aide about making damn sure that Williams got the meetings he wanted with Virginia state officials. McDonnell didn’t stop there. He also accepted as a gift a Rolex watch, a $20,000 loan, and the payment for the catering bill for his daughter’s wedding. Mrs. McDonnell (Virginia’s first lady) was the individual who suggested to Williams that her husband needed a new watch —and, presumably, a Timex wouldn’t do. Well, and while she was at it,  Find Out More >  40,367 Maureen could use a new wardrobe totaling $20,000. Considering all of Mr. Williams’ gifts, the McDonnell’s accepted $175,000.00. Most of us would conclude that there may not be a clearer case of political corruption: facilitating access to state officials in return for a very large chunk of change and a few trinkets. It sounds corrupt to me.  But this isn’t how Chief Justice Roberts viewed it.  The court ruled that the Virginia jury was wrong to think that Governor McDonnell’s actions constituted “official corruption.” The McDonnell conviction was overturned —and in the process, the Supreme Court established a new standard for determining the government corruption —a standard so narrow that it will, in the future, be difficult to convict any but the most incompetent of our politicians.  While an official act can still be illegal, the definition of that term has been excessively broad. Something as commonplace as an executive turning to an aide and telling him or her to make something happen or accepting a check and then having a quiet word with government regulators, or even a suggestion to subordinates that a door ought to be opened for an influence-buyer does not, in and of itself, represent an official act.  No, of course not.  Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... Chief Justice Roberts opined that an official act “must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee.”  What?  Right —in the absence of a gavel, there is no bribery or corruption. I’ll call this the smoking gavel rule. Roberts said that bribery is “the kind of thing that can be put on an agenda, tracked for progress, and then checked off as complete.”  Well, I suppose the court is at least consistent. In the Citizens-United case, the court allowed rich people to purchase politicians. Now they are able to purchase office-holders as well. One pundit suggested that the high court was worried that if the McDonnell conviction was upheld, all of our politicians would begin to live in a state of fear (as opposed, to say, strutting around like the arrogant asses they are), sure that almost anyone could go to prison for being corrupt. God forbid that should ever happen.  Justice Roberts wrote, “Conscientious public officials arrange meetings for constituents, contact other officials on their behalf, and include them in events all the time.” If McDonnell’s conviction was upheld, it would “cast a pall of potential prosecution over these relationships.” He added, “officials might wonder whether they could respond to even the most commonplace requests for assistance, and citizens with legitimate concerns might shrink from participating in democratic discourse.”  Has America’s high court come to accept the premise that corrupt politics is simply how politics is done? It is certainly true that trading cash, favors, trips to Europe, expensive gifts and gifts of underage prostitutes is a common occurrence in our government today. Interestingly, during the court’s deliberations, it accepted a number of amicus briefs from White House lawyers who argued that the business of politics, as we know it, would be disturbed if the McDonnell decision were upheld. What White House lawyers? I don’t know their names, but it was during the Obama administration.  Bottom line: influence peddling as a form of corruption has been upheld by the highest court in the land. To everyone imagining that the Supreme Court was our last hope for a just America —think again.  ",POLITICS,Fake
HUGE WIN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP & FOR AMERICA ,"HUGE ELECTION WIN FOR THE PRESIDENT           =====  Find Out More >  41,782         We do not mean to bully or harass anyone – but we will tell the truth.     SUBSCRIBE – MAKE A DIFFERENCE     CONSERVATIVES – DO NOT FRET  ==========     Last Night was a HUGE win for President Trump     1st) The President got rid of all the “Never Trumpers” in the Republican Party who were blocking him at every turn.  =====     2nd) He gained complete control of the Senate – Allowing him now to appoint hundreds of Constitutional Judges across the nation. It also clearly puts him in control of the Federal Reserve System and the World’s Banking System.     This is HUGE – since under the 1871 Constitution the Judges are in complete control of the Nation and make the Laws – Not Congress     That’s Called:     “THE RULE OF LAW”     So now President Trump controls the Military,  the appointments of Judges, and therefore the Making of the Laws in this nation.     If those in the Space Program comes against our President – they will be utterly destroyed. So GOD has said it – so it shall be.  =====     3rd) He allowed the Massive Voter Fraud to occur so he can Force the new members of Congress to “Toe The Line” or he will have:     …a) US DOJ investigate theses Congressman for Criminal Violations of Campaign Financing     …b ) Have the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) Investigate them for civil violations of the Federal Election Campaign Laws and legally take everything away from them that they own.     In other words – the Voter Fraud and Illegal Campaign Financing was allowed in order for President Trump to hold this over the heads of those in congress and the Senate to who refuse to obey Trump.     TRUMP: IT MATTERS NOT WHAT PARTY THEY ARE IN – ONLY IF THEY DO AS I WISH     =====     4th) Control of the Senate means the Chevron Doctrine was destroyed – meaning that the 4th Wing of the Government – the “Departments and Agencies -  have have their power stripped from them.     This also allows the President to order the DOJ to prosecute crimes at the State, County and City levels.  =====     5th) While we were all focused on the elections The US Supreme Court allowed the Net Neutrality Laws to stand – Meaning Social Media is now a public Forum – meaning your Video Channel can no longer be pulled from You Tube and your Website can no longer be pulled by Google.  =====     6th) Now that he is in control of the Federal Reserve System he has been using his power to take down the Elite Bankstas that are destroying the World’s Economies.     7th) By making the Democrats “Control” the house he avoided a Revolution.     So the Democrats pretend to be in charge and the Lunatic Lefties are pacified like Little Children.     It was all one big set up by the MAKE AMERICA GREAT Corporation.     The Genius of President Trump   ==========     TYPES OF ELECTION FRAUD ALLOWED BY TRUMP     1) Illegal Aliens voting     2) Dead Voting     3) People just created out of thin air voting     4) Voting Machine Malfunctions     5) Hacking Into The Elections to create false outcomes     6) Fake Ballots     7) Voter Precinct Officers actually  dumping paper ballots in the woods  ===========     NOW TRUMP CONTROLS THE ECONOMIC RESET     What this means is that all those silly little unconstitutional Laws passed by States, Counties and Cities will become unenforceable as their budgets are destroyed by this Reset.     They will not have any money to enforce their illegal laws.

Chris Wallace Says Jim Acosta ‘Embarrassed Himself’ In Confrontation With Trump ,"Give up the mic, Jim  The blowback of the wild press conference at the White House the day after the midterm elections continues as now reporters are taking sides on the actions of Jim Acosta from CNN.  As my colleague Brandon Morse wrote earlier today, Major Garret from CBS is ok with Acosta and his behavior, Major Garrett Sides With CNN’s Jim Acosta Over White House Scuffle, Signaling Everything Wrong With Today’s Press  Now have Fox News host Chris Wallace taking a different view.  Jim Acosta embarrassed himself.  Find Out More >  70,287 According to The Hill…  Fox News host Chris Wallace on Wednesday chided Jim Acosta’s behavior during President Trump’s press conference earlier in the afternoon, saying the CNN chief White House correspondent “embarrassed himself.”  The “Fox News Sunday” host weighed in after Acosta sparred with Trump over the president’s portrayal of the Central American migrant caravan as an “invasion” heading toward the southern U.S. border, leading to a tense exchange.  “It was classic Trump, and you saw all the notes that he can play,” Wallace said on Fox when asked about Trump’s pushback toward Acosta.  “He was combative, at times. He got into a fight with Jim Acosta of CNN. I have to say, I thought Acosta’s behavior was shameful,” Wallace continued.  “Most of the people there were serious reporters asking serious questions. But Jim Acosta, I thought, embarrassed himself today,” Wallace added later.  Wallace is right.  Trump and Acosta both acted out of line.  However, when you are part of the media that is criticizing the behavior of President Trump than you decide to out Trump, Trump, in his place of business for at least the next two years, you lose whatever credibility you have left.  CNN does not have much left being they still employ Don Lemon.  Jim Acosta has made most of his questions about his preening before cameras and soaking up as much camera time as possible. That his colleagues in the White House press corps are defending his antics is just silly. There is no defending Jim Acosta just as there is no defending Trump losing his cool in front of the country.  Hopefully more reporters have the courage to come out like Chris Wallace and say that Acosta was out of line and should apologize.

Men Form Human Shield Around Women to Protect them From Gunman During California Shooting ,"In a stunning act of selflessness, a group of men formed a protective wall around a group of young women in order to shield them from bullets during California’s deadly shooting that claimed the lives of 12 people.  According to the Daily Signal, three women gave an interview to ABC after the event and told the harrowing story:  “While we were all dog-piled at the side, there were multiple men that got on their knees and pretty much blocked all of us with their backs towards the shooter, ready to take a bullet for any single one of us,” Teylor Whittler, woman who had been in the club during the shooting, said Thursday morning, via ABC News.  “And just the amount of people who made sure everyone got out OK or if they were out … they made sure, they went around to every single person around them and asked them if they were OK and if they needed a phone to call their family … just in general any way they could help. It was awesome,” she continued.

Rick Scott Wins Court Order Requiring Broward County to Obey Florida Law ,"Right now, the Democrat machine in Broward County, Florida, is trying to steal two elections: governor and senate.

Florida Politician Uses Twitter to Encourage Vote Fraud ,"Right now, Democrat run elections boards in the Florida counties of Palm Beach and Broward Counties are in the process of literally stealing the races for senator and governor. Literally. And without even an attempt at artifice and concealment. They are stealing the election and they are rubbing our collective noses in it. While the elections officials in those counties are directly to blame, it is clear a culture of lawlessness runs deep in those counties.  In Florida’s 18th district, a so-called battleground district where Republican Brian Mast is holding a seat previously held by Democrat Patrick Murphy, Mast has a 9-point lead–some 30,000 votes–over challenger Lauren Baer. That should be it, one would think. But you’d think wrong.

Ironically, Rick Scott had the ability to clean some of this crap up when he was governor and he elected to not do so. What seems to me to be needed is a massive intervention by the US Department of Justice on the same level as it employed to stamp out voter suppression in the Civil Rights era.

"Election Reflection: Forget The Spin, Danger Lies Ahead For Republicans ","A six-year-old boy runs into a toy store ahead of his mother and makes a beeline over to the gun department. Next, a three-year-old girl pulls her mother into the store and leads her directly to the Barbie aisle. She knows just where it is. Finally, a ten-year-old boy enters the store. Knowing precisely what he came for, he heads straight for the LEGO sets and makes his selection. All three children have found exactly what they came for.  Similarly, Tuesday’s midterm elections offered pundits and partisans almost anything they were looking for. The results can be interpreted a hundred different ways. Republicans explain their loss of the House Majority by telling us it is an expected political norm for the party occupying the White House to lose control of Congress in the first midterm election. And that may be true. The New York Times has a different take. “Democrats harnessed voter fury toward President Trump to win control of the House and capture pivotal governorships Tuesday night as liberals and moderates banded together to deliver a forceful rebuke of Mr. Trump.” That may also be true. So, what was it, an expected political norm or voter fury toward President Trump?  1. It was a mediocre night for both parties. As a lifelong Republican, I am delighted that we expanded our majority in the Senate. President Trump can continue transforming the judiciary and should be able to bring a Supreme Court nominee through the Senate confirmation process relatively unscathed as well as a replacement for former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. A Republican Senate can also prevent bills originating in the House from becoming law.  But Republicans should all be concerned about how narrow the margins of victory were in states like Florida and Texas, two battleground states that are key to Trump’s bid for reelection.  Amendment 4 was on the ballot in Florida. The initiative, which passed, will restore voting rights to more than one million felons. Considering who felons are most likely to vote for and that now Governor-elect Ron DeSantis prevailed over Andrew Gillum by only 43,190 votes and now Senator-elect Rick Scott won by only 30,264 votes, Republicans should be worried about 2020. I know that voting is probably not a top priority for many felons, but if only 10% of them voted, it would mean 140,000 additional Democratic votes, enough to have handed a victory to both Gillum and Bill Nelson.  Find Out More >  70,404 2. The electoral landscape in Texas, a state with 38 electoral votes, has been changing over the years. It is a state that is a must-win for Trump in 2020. My worry here is, although I’m delighted Ted Cruz won, he should have won by a larger margin. Governor Greg Abbott won reelection by 13.5 points and Cruz beat Beto O’Rourke by only 2.6 points. Granted, Cruz is rather unlikeable.  But the state seems to be slowly turning blue, especially, and almost counterintuitively, the districts that border Mexico. Although most of the map appears red, the populous cities of Dallas, Austin, Houston and Corpus Christi are turning bluer. Rush Limbaugh discussed what’s going on in Texas on his radio show.  They think they won with Beto losing last night, because he got so close and because of all the money he raised. They’re now touting Beto as their presidential front-runner, bunch of Democrats, bunch of Hollywood leftists think, “This is the guy because he almost won.”  But if you look at Texas the way we’re describing here, every county — I don’t think there’s a single exception — every county of Texas, starting with El Paso that comes down and borders Mexico, is Democrat. Now, how many there in that area are here via illegal immigration and otherwise?  So it is a challenge, I mean, going forward. How long can this keep up? What’s the demographic distribution of where these people are, how young are the people in the metro areas versus in the suburban and rural?  There’s Texas. We haven’t lost Texas yet. The Democrats are not gonna stop until they take Texas. There’s 38 electoral votes. If they get Texas, they’ve got a lock on the presidency forever. California, New York, Illinois, Texas, that’s all they need.  Now, take a look at that, folks. You see Dallas, you see San Antonio, Houston, Corpus Christi, little specks of blue there in population centers in Texas. Fort Worth is not quite blue, but it’s not red, either, nor pink. But fully 75, 80% of that state county by county is red. But take a look at that border with Mexico, and you see two little sections of pink there near El Paso. And outside of that, it is solid blue.  That is one of the best graphics I could show you to illustrate the necessity of serious border control, however it’s done — a wall staffed about you (sic) numbers of people to keep people from coming in, however it’s done, that right there is one of the ways in which Texas is being taken over, invaded, infiltrated, whatever word you want to use.   Photo credit: screenshot from Rushlimbaugh.com  Now, that’s a microcosm for the whole country. The whole country, if you look at the continental 48, the vast majority of it’s gonna be red until you get to population centers where it’s solid the blue. And solid blue is where Santa Claus is. Big, liberal cities and states where they give away everything. That’s where Santa Claus is.  3. Republicans have nearly lost the state of Virginia. Sen. Tim Kaine easily held onto his seat. Democrats picked up three new House seats adding to the four seats they held onto. Republicans held onto four seats. Limbaugh said:  The Democrats have totally flipped Virginia. It’s gone. The Democrats are one election away from totally flipping North Carolina. If you live in Raleigh-Durham you essentially live in New York City now. If you’re Republican and you live in Raleigh-Durham you may as well live in Manhattan because your political life is no different.  4. A Democratic House Majority means gridlock. Some see that as a positive. The stock market likes gridlock. On the other hand, few of the important issues will be resolved. Although the Senate will be able to prevent passage of any unreasonable bills, keeping a check on the House, the enactment of much of President Trump’s planned agenda will become impossible. Frivolous investigations will be initiated and time and tax dollars will be wasted. House Committees will be led by such undesirables as the repellent Adam Schiff, the radical Maxine Waters and the inane Nancy Pelosi. Surprisingly, Trump expressed his support of Pelosi to return to her old role as Speaker of the House. Maybe he thinks her antics will provide some inflammatory material for 2020 campaign ads.  5. At 9:33 on Tuesday night, Fox News called the House for the Democrats. Their new voter analysis program allowed them to make this projection before polls had closed in the western part of the country, which should be illegal. Their job is to report the news, not to influence the news. All of the networks likely had the new voter analysis program as well, but following the debacle of the Florida recount in 2000, when multiple networks called the state for Al Gore before polls had closed in the panhandle portion of the state, which was located in a different time zone, they’ve learned something.  It’s now well known that all five TV networks and the Associated Press declared Florida for Al Gore at 7:50 p.m. Eastern time, 10 minutes before the polls closed in the panhandle counties. That could not have dissuaded many voters from casting ballots. But far more serious was the announcement by all five networks at 7 p.m. Eastern time that the polls in Florida had closed. As Brill’s Content reported: “At 7 p.m., ET, every network was talking about the poll closings in nine states. And every network was wrong: the polls were closing in only eight states. . . . The polls in that heavily Republican [panhandle of Florida] wouldn’t close for another hour — 8 p.m. ET.” The networks, with the exception of Fox News Channel, continued to repeat this misinformation throughout that hour.",POLITICS,Fake

We Missed the Sign & Will Likely Be Lost in the Cities If We Don’t Get Out by May ,"Christ gave his disciples a sign of when to flee the city [of Jerusalem].

The Sign? “When you see the abomination spoken of by Daniel, standing where it ought not, flee…” Mark 13:14. Early believers understood his words to mean the Roman army, and they fled when Cestius came in 66 AD–it was 3 1/2 years before Titus.  3 1/2 years from signs in 2015 is 2019, but we saw no Roman army?  We saw Rome “standing where it ought not” (Mark 13:14) in US Congress in Sept, 2015. Rome is the city of 7 hills in Revelation 17:9 and the pope represents the harlot committing “fornication with kings” (verse 2) to make laws for her religion and prosecute heretics as millions died in the Dark Ages when she had the power to persecute. vs 6.

Israel was spewed out and a Catholic-dominant Supreme Court voted this abomination as marriage, also in 2015. The spewing is beginning as we see demon-strations in cities like never before…    Christ covered it all in his closing parables that have May timing, “as the days of Noah” when the Flood came with Passover timing, but in the 2nd spring month, Gen 7:11.  “THEN [same time] shall two be in the field; one taken and the other left.” Matt 24:40. This is NOT a rapture–the parallel text in Luke 17:37 shows it means death… How?  Probably in a FEMA camp.

After Reagan took a bullet, he decided comply with their pressure for an ambassador to the Vatican and he opened the US southern border. Reagan also approved REX 84–FEMA camps!  FEMA camps were to be for illegal aliens, but the CIA (called Catholics In Action) and Homeland Security (called Romeland Security by a nun who was raped) now sees no problem with aliens but DHS considers fundamental believers in Bible prophecy (like this topic) as potential domestic terrorists (to Jesuits) that may need screening…at a FEMA camp.

The context is the end-time “day of the Lord” and it’s 3 1/2 years from when the pope stood in congress, Mark 13:14.  Authors on ‘strategic relocation’ see cities as death traps. When trouble comes, millions will wish they had obeyed Christ to flee the city. A month early is better than a day late. If we wait till we see martial law, Christ said, Don’t even go to your house to get your things, Matthew 24:18.

11/10 From 1960: Pops #2,"1964 – IF Junior Noboa was born in Azua de Compostela, Dominican Republic. He got his final two at bats as a Bucco in 1994, going 0-for-2 to close out an eight-year MLB career. Junior spent one more year in the minors, served as batting coach for the Dominican National teams and now works in the Arizona Diamondbacks front office as Vice President of Latin Operations, helping land Miguel Montero, Gerardo Parra, Ender Inciarte, Carlos Gonzalez, and José Valverde.  1967 – The Pirates announced a $25-30,000 deal with Monsanto Corporation to cover the field of the Bucs’ Eastern League affiliate York (Memorial Stadium) with artificial turf. The experiment would determine if Astroturf would be an acceptable alternative to grass for the proposed Three Rivers Stadium, as the co-tenants of TRS, the Steelers, indicated that they would favor an artificial surface (they changed their minds, thx to player input, when Heinz Field was designed; ditto for the Bucs and PNC Park). It worked out OK, tho not so much for the York Pirates – their franchise folded after the ‘69 season and Memorial Stadium was used by the area softball players before the turf wore out after a decade of use.   Pops 1971 Topps Super 1971 – Willie Stargell (.295/48/125) was MVP runner-up to Joe Torre‚ who led the NL in RBI (137) and batting (.363) while hitting 24 HR. Torre received 318 points to Stargell’s 222. However, Pops did win the WS and HR title.  1982 – C Matt Pagnozzi was born in Miami, Arizona. Pagnozzi got in pieces of five MLB campaigns, including a 2011 stop in Pittsburgh as one of eight catchers used by the Bucs. Matt hit .250 in his five games (the Pirates didn’t pick him up until mid-September). He packed up the tools of ignorance after the 2015 season and 13 campaigns in the majors, minors and Dominican.  2011 – The Pirates signed free agent C Rod Barajas to a one-year/$4M contract with club option for 2013 ($3.5 million with no buyout). Hot Rod hit .206 and threw out just a half dozen baserunners all year. His option wasn’t exercised, marking the end of his MLB road, and he’s now a minor-league manager.  2015 – Starling Marte was named a Gold Glove Award winner for the first time. Marte led all NL left fielders in fielding percentage (.995), making just one error in 196 total chances. He also led all National League outfielders with 16 assists, the most by a Pirates OF’er since Jose Guillen (also 16) in 1998, with 15 coming without a relay man. Andrew McCutchen and Gerrit Cole were also GG finalists, but lost out to AJ Pollock and Zack Greinke.   Starling saves the day (image Root Sports) 2018 – Jameson Taillon was honored at the Rotary Club’s Chuck Tanner banquet with the Memorial Award while Lanny Frattare took the Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his 33 years as “Voice of the Pirates.” Sandy Dengler was awarded the Sally O’Leary Distinguished Woman in Baseball trophy after spending 20 years with Tampa Bay (and she also served as the Buccos Bradenton complex coordinator before that).

Buy ‘Em or Deny ‘Em: Will The Marlins’ Sandy Alcantara Be A Breakout Candidate In 2019? ,"by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)  We all know that the Marlins are in the midst of a rebuild.  We also know that the pitching staff is in flux, meaning that they are going to continue giving young pitchers opportunities in the rotation.  One such pitcher should be Sandy Alcantara, who they acquired as part of the Marcell Ozuna trade.  They gave him six starts late in 2018, and while his 3.44 ERA over 34.0 IP gives a sense of hope the other numbers are vastly different.  Just look at the main metrics we look at for any pitcher:  Strikeouts – 7.94 K/9 Control – 6.09 BB/9 Groundballs – 47.7% The strikeout rate was actually better than his Triple-A mark (6.85 over 115.2 IP).  His 10.4% SwStr% does give a sense of hope that he can maintain the mark, and is right inline with his 9.9% mark at Triple-A.  Granted that’s not going to make him an elite starter, but it would be enough if he carried another skill…  That’s where things get concerning, because you have to wonder if there’s anything that we can hang our hat on.  Alcantara’s groundball rate in the Majors is obviously unspectacular, and while his 49.4% at Triple-A was better it also isn’t going to blow you away.  While he was a little bit better over the course of his minor league career, a GO/AO of 1.08 at Triple-A and 1.01 at Double-A is fairly pedestrian.  Pitching in Miami helps, but is it really enough?  Find Out More >  82,329 Then you have the control, which has never been elite.  Obviously he’s not as bad as he showed in the Majors, but a 3.5 BB/9 in the minors is mediocre and tells us that he’s going to have his issues.  A year later, these are the same concerns we had of him after he was traded to Miami, when we gave him a “C+” grade and said:  “Another piece of the Marcell Ozuna trade, Alcantara reached the Majors last season making 8 appearances out of the bullpen.  He struggled with his control while there (6.48 BB/9), and that’s just a continuation of what he’s been doing in the minors the past two years:  Single-A (90.1 IP) – 4.48 BB/9 High-A (32.1 IP) – 3.90 BB/9 Double-A (125.1 IP) – 3.88 BB/9 He also didn’t generate many groundballs while at Double-A (44.8%) and struggled with home runs during his time in the Majors (2.16 HR/9).  There’s swing and miss stuff and upside in the 22-year old, but you also have to wonder if he’s ultimately ticketed for the bullpen or if he can solve the two obvious flaws.”  Could Alcantara take a step forward in his development?  Maybe, but at this point don’t count on it.  At best he should be seen as a streaming option, especially pitching at home, but in most formats he’s not going to be worth trusting if he gets the opportunity.

"Start ‘Em or Sit ‘Em (2018): Wide Receiver Edition: Week 10: Josh Gordon, Calvin Ridley, Corey Davis & More ","Trying to decide who you should start or sit this week? Let’s take a look at a few potential decisions owners have and try to sort through them:  Josh Gordon – New England Patriots at Tennessee  Gordon has slowly seen his role expand in New England, and he’s now posted 100+ yards in two of his past three games:  Week 7 – 4 receptions for 100 yards Week 8 – 4 receptions for 42 yards Week 9 – 5 receptions for 130 yards and 1 TD What was in common for Week 7 and Week 9?  Rob Gronkowski was sidelined, so his status for Week 10 is going to play a big role in Gordon’s outlook.  If Gronkowski is out Gordon is going to be an obvious WR2 against a Titans’ defense that’s allowed the ninth most points to opposing wide receivers on a weekly basis.  If Gronkowski plays?  Consider Gordon more of a WR3, but with enough upside to consider.  Verdict – Start ‘Em (especially if Gronkowski is sidelined again)  Find Out More >  82,357 Amari Cooper – Dallas Cowboys at Philadelphia  It was a nice Dallas debut for Cooper, turning 8 targets into 5 receptions, 58 yards and 1 TD.  The Cowboys’ offense hasn’t been all that impressive, but neither has Philadelphia’s defense against opposing wide receivers (fifth most points per week, including the fourth most receptions).  There’s no question that Cooper is the team’s obvious top receiver and with this matchup the upside will be there for him to produce once again.  Verdict – Start ‘Em (solid WR2)  Calvin Ridley – Atlanta Falcons at Cleveland  After going on a TD binge earlier in the season, Ridley had three straight scoreless weeks (12 receptions for 128 yards over that stretch) before returning the end zone in Week 9.  The problem is that he has just one game with more than 75 yards this season and the Falcons could easily go to Julio Jones (1 TD), Mohamed Sanu (3 TD) or Austin Hooper (2 TD) instead of Ridley.  You also can’t ignore Tevin Coleman, who has caught 4 TD passes himself.  As a TD dependent option and with a slew of alternatives, is Ridley someone you want to trust in shallower formats?  Verdict – Sit ‘Em (he’s a TD dependent WR3)  DeSean Jackson – Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Washington  There’s been a lot of talk surrounding Jackson, who reportedly had requested a trade ahead of the deadline.  There was also a lot of hope with the return of Ryan Fitzpatrick as quarterback, though the results still weren’t there in Week 9 (2 receptions for 32 yards on 4 targets).  He showed a tremendous rapport with Fitzpatrick in September, though he still racked up just 17 catches (he turned them into 424 yards and 3 TD).  Clearly he was boom or bust, and he was booming quite a bit early.  With Washington having allowed just 25 receptions of 20+ yards (tied for ninth fewest) and the potential for Tampa Bay to feed the ball to Mike Evans after he struggled in Week 9 (as well as back-to-back big games for Adam Humphries), the risk of a bust day is a bit too large.  Verdict – Sit ‘Em (only viable as a WR3)  DeVante Parker – Miami Dolphins at Green Bay  After a huge game there was a lot of hype surrounding Parker heading into Week 9, only to watch him disappear against the Jets (1 reception for 8 yards).  Granted the Dolphins could be forced to go with a much more pass happy approach to keep up with the Packers, who have allowed the fourth most points per week to opposing wide receivers.  Is there any guarantee it’s Parker, though?  Danny Amendola will remain the de facto top option…  Kenyan Drake may be considered the #2 pass catching option…  Kenny Stills remains in the mix…  There are simply too many questions.  Verdict – Sit ‘Em (can be considered as a high risk WR3 if desperate)  Corey Davis – Tennessee Titans vs. New England  The Titans are going to be forced to go with a heavier pass attack to try and keep up with the Patriots, and that should lead to results for Davis.  He’s had 17 targets over the past two weeks and should see a similar workload once again.  He’s hardly a guarantee to produce, especially in an offense that hasn’t set the world on fire this season, considering his 36 receptions and 1 TD on the year.  There’s enough potential in the matchup and recent opportunities to consider him a solid WR3 however.  Verdict – Start ‘Em (viable WR3)  Sources – ESPN, NFL.com  ** PRE-ORDER SALE ** Order Rotoprofessor’s 2018 Fantasy Baseball Draft Guide for just $7.75!!

Ranking the Power 5 Football Conferences after Week 10 ,"While the playoff committee doesn’t rank the power 5 conference, there is no way conference strength – which means OOC results doesn’t figure in to a committee members thought process.  Let me point out on my philosophy on these rankings – your most recent  OOC results count a lot, and you’ll see me reference that throughout the season.  We’ll give each conference a relative strength value 1-10.  Let me explain my relative rankings  0-5 : Conference lacks depth no elite teams  Find Out More >  82,511 6-7: Conference lacks depth, and there are 1-2 elite teams, and 1-2 quality teams  7-8: At least 2 elite teams, and at least 2 quality teams.  8-9: 3 elite teams, and at least 2 quality teams  9-10: 1/2 of conference is elite and/or quality teams.  1) SEC – 8.0  Goodbye LSU and Goodbye Kentucky from the playoff chase. They went down to Alabama and Georgia.  Why is LSU ranked 7th anyways? They really only have the win over Georgia.  Alabama and Georgia host ranked teams Mississippi State and Auburn, but I doubt they have any issues.  Playoff Contenders  Alabama, Georgia  In the Playoff Picture  NONE  2) Big 12 – 6.9  I’m still not ready to say West Virginia is in the playoff picture, but they are close and they’ll get their chances.  Oklahoma hosts Oklahoma State, and needs to keep winning. The Sooners are right there if anyone ahead of them falters.  Playoff Contenders    Oklahoma  In the Playoff Picture  NONE  3) Big 10 – 6.8  I still don’t consider Ohio State a playoff threat. Ranked 10th they do play at Michigan State. That’s a game they obviously need to win to have any playoff chance.  Michigan gets Rutgers – in other-words a Bye week.  Playoff Contenders   Michigan  In the Playoff Picture  NONE  4) ACC – 6.6  Clemson faces their toughest remaining test when they head to Boston College. The Tigers are the ACC’s only remaining playoff contender.  Who knew Syracuse would add depth to the league? They are ranked 13.  Playoff Contenders  Clemson  In the Playoff Picture  NONE  5) Pac 12 – 6.5  Washington State is ranked 8th in the playoff poll and is the Pac 12’s only hope. They face Colorado this week.

The playoff committee’s inconsistent and ever changing criteria is causing unnecessary frustration and confusion. It’s one of the improvement points I’d have for them.  If I had a vote this is who I would put in the playoff right now.  In –   Notre Dame | Alabama | Clemson | Michigan  Just Missed – 5) Georgia 6) Oklahoma 7) UCF 8) Washington State",SPORTS,Fake
"Weekly Notes: Kang, Corey, Cruz, Cole; Gage & Moves... ","Stuff keeps happening…  The Bucs, as expected (and hoped) re-signed Jung Ho Kang for one year, reportedly for $3M base + $2.5M in incentives, redistributing but still equalling the original $5.5M option. The Bucs see him as a 3B and a potential platoon partner with Colin Moran, but not an option at SS, so that hole has yet to be addressed.  Corey Dickerson, who arrived in Pittsburgh with a rep as a meh gloveman only to be thrown into PNC Park’s massive left field, accepted the challenge and took home his first Golden Glove award. He ranked first among NL left fielders with a .996 fielding % while making one error in 263 chances and setting career highs with seven assists in 122 starts in left. Corey saved 16 defensive runs this year.  Oneil Cruz 2018 Go Sports MLB.com picked each team’s best minor league power prospect.

Bill Mitchell of Baseball America has a piece about the standouts in the Arizona Fall Stars game.

Good news on the injury front: Nicholas Caporoso of Rumbunter reports that RHP Gage Hinsz, one of the Bucs young gun arms, will pitch winter league ball, a quick rebound after losing the season to heart valve replacement surgery. Will Leitch of MLB.com selected each team’s best FA signing of the 21st century. His Bucco choice: Russ Martin. C Jin-de Jhang, who was buried in the organizational depth charts and opted for free agency, reportedly signed with the Giants.  MLB housekeeping w/a Pittsburgh touch: 2B Dilson Herrera was removed from Cincy’s 40-man roster, 3B Andy LaRoche was released by KC (he hasn’t stuck with an MLB organization since 2014, so it’s mostly a paper move), and OF Alex Dickerson declared for free agency from San Diego, along with IF Chase d’Arnaud of the Giants.

Preview: Michigan at THE RUTGER 2018 ,"Kickoff time: 3:30 EST  HighPoint.com Stadium, Piscataway Line: Michigan -a lot, o/u DIV ZERO  Throughout history, the English and the French have gone to war about 23 times. For over six decades, these two historic programs did not care for each other one bit. And I mean, it’s pretty fair to say that France invading English-controlled Normandy in 1204 and scattering little ‘F’ magnets around the courtyard of Château Gaillard could be seen as an act of war. I guess that’s what happens when you have soldiers smack-talking each other on the way to the locker room after the Battle of Gisors 6 years prior.  The bloodiest of all these conflicts was the Hundred Years’ War which ranged from 1337 to 1453, a conflict that could warrant its own Game of Thrones series. The gist of it is the major English houses said “France belongs to us” but the French houses said “no, we’re French, France belongs to us”, and after some failed peace treaty talks, both sides decided to solve their problems with aggression. Oh, and plague. Some of the problems were solved with plague.  In true Game of Thrones season 7 fashion, let’s immediately fast forward about 78 years. The English army that had crossed the channel and made it to France was heading north to Calais, a prime recruiting area that would allow English soldiers that had committed to fight for King Henry V a shorter travel, making the war cheaper. But the French army had caught up to the massively outnumbered English army and was cutting off their passage.  This Brings us to the Battle of Agincourt The exact strength of each nation is not 100%. But estimates suggest the French had about 2,400 cavalry knights, 7,600 infantry, 4,000 archers, and 1,500 crossbows – about 15,000-16,000 total.  The English had about 1,000 infantry and 5,000 archers.  The exact numbers are up to debate with historians, but the unit types involved are not. On paper, this is a battle that heavily favored the French and their S̶c̶a̶r̶l̶e̶t̶  knights.",SPORTS,Fake
Crystal Ball Scratching ,"With just under seven weeks to go until Christmas, the next couple of months are very important for clubs chasing promotion or trying to avoid relegation.  As there are no particularly outstanding games in the Championship this weekend I thought I’d gaze into my crystal ball this week to make some quick predictions – especially as we’ve got another bl**dy international break coming up next weekend.  It looks as if I’m going to have to eat my words about Leeds – they’re much better than I thought they’d be and there’s a chance that by Boxing Day they may have secured pole position – their key game before the festivities is a trip to Bramall Lane on December 1st. Looking further ahead, February may be the key month for Leeds but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Leeds’ biggest rivals for automatic promotion are Middlesbrough and WBA, but although Marcelo Bielsa’s side are well balanced, Tony Pulis and Darren Moore’s men have glaring issues: Middlesbrough don’t score enough goals, whilst WBA’s defence is non-existent. Only four teams have conceded more goals than the Baggies and two of them are in the bottom three. Along with Leeds, Birmingham and Nottingham Forest are unrecognisable from last season – the latter pair have become tough to beat, but may need to wait another season for a realistic chance of promotion. Forest’s best case scenario is the playoffs. Norwich aren’t as good as the current table suggests: they’ve done well against the bottom half of the table, but have already lost at home to Leeds and WBA. They have a reasonable looking schedule this month; December will be far harder. Sheffield Wednesday are worse than the current table suggests: current owners of the worst defensive record in the division they’ve played 12 games against the teams currently above them and lost seven of those contests, winning just twice. They face Sheffield United on Friday (Sky Sports Football/Main Event 7:45pm this evening) and Derby later in the month. As it stands, Paul Lambert has a well nigh impossible task of keeping Ipswich from dropping into the third tier for the first time since the late 1950s, but I’d expect Rotherham and Bolton to be drawn into the relegation battle over the next few weeks: both teams are struggling to score goals – at the moment there are three other clubs that have scored less than a goal per game, including QPR who are currently eleventh and are second in the eight game form table behind Norwich. Reading and Preston will continue to make progress up the table and although I don’t think Reading will trouble the top half, Preston are more than capable of doing that even though they look as if they’ve left it too late for a playoff challenge. Televised games this week – Sky Sports Football/Main Event unless stated:  I’ve already mentioned the Sheffield derby, which is always entertaining and shouldn’t be missed if you’ve got the opportunity to watch. The other game on Sky Sports this weekend is between WBA and Leeds at The Hawthorns (tomorrow, 5:30pm) – for some of us, that’ll bring back memories of a very controversial game from the 1970/71 season…",SPORTS,Fake
"11/9: Nix on Nixey; Bella Ball; Supremes; HBD Nick, Goooooch, Scott, Cy, Blue Goose, Fred, Red & Jerry ","1868 – RHP “Cyclone” Bill Phillips was born in Allenport in Washington County, between Charleroi and Brownsville. Phillips broke into the big leagues in 1890 at age 21, throwing 10 games for the Pittsburgh Allegheny with an 0-1/7.57 line (he was actually first a member of the Washington Nationals, but never got into a game and joined Pittsburgh when the DC club folded). He pitched for seven seasons in the majors, the last six with the Reds, and managed for a couple more. Bill died at age 72 in Charleroi and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Fayette City. He picked up his “Cyclone” moniker while with the Nationals; it was a popular honorific for young fireballers. He was also known as “Whoa Bill” which was said to be the result of Phillips’, who was a miner before he became a ballplayer, comical attempt to tame a bronco. Many sites list him as “Silver Bill,” but we think that’s a crossed wire as that was the nickname of 1B Bill Phillips who played a decade earlier, although it’s possibly a hand-me-down to our Bill. Phillips factoid: Bill was the first pitcher to allow two grand slams in the same inning during an 18-5 loss to the Chicago Colts while tossing for the Allegheny.  1885 – LHP Gene “Blue Goose” Moore was born in Lancaster, Texas. He tossed for parts of three MLB seasons with his first two years as a Pirate (1909-10; he didn’t make the World Series roster), posting a line of 2-1, 4.66 in five outings. We can’t vouch 100% for his nickname, but he spent his entire 11-year minor league career in the Texas League, and while playing for Galveston (he spent five campaigns there) was known to frequent a tavern near the ballyard called The Blue Goose. His son, Gene Jr, was an All-Star OF’er who played for six big league teams from 1931 through 1945.   Nick Maddox 1908 Real Photo Postcard 1886 – RHP Nick Maddox was born in Govanstown, Maryland. He tossed four years (1907-10) for Pittsburgh, his entire MLB career, with a 43-20/2.29 line. He threw a no-hitter as a rookie, won 23 games in 1908, and a World Series contest in 1909. Maddox won his first four starts, something no other Pirate would match until Gerrit Cole in 2013. He stayed in Pittsburgh after his brief career ended due to arm problems, raising nine kids in Millvale while holding down a job at the Fort Pitt Brewery.  1897 – C Johnny Gooch was born in Smyrna, Tennessee. He caught eight years (1921-28) for the Pirates, hitting .286 in a part-time role and was a member of of the 1925 and 1927 World Series clubs. Per Greg Tucker of the Rutherford County (TN) Historical Society, the fans liked Johnny in part because he had a “fun name.” When Johnny was introduced at the ballpark, the announcer would bellow “Johnny Gooooooch” and the fans would echo the “ooooo.” A lifelong friend of Pie Traynor, his minor league teammate, Gooch was a Pirate pitching coach and scout from 1937-42. Afterward, Johnny opened a factory making baseball bats in 1943 and was the exclusive supplier to the major leagues until 1947, when he switched from producing bats to lamps.  1906 – OF Fred Brickell was born in Saffordville, Kansas. Brickell played for Pittsburgh from 1926-30, hitting .312 as a reserve outfielder. Fred’s minor & major league career went from 1925-36 with Brickell elected into the Kansas Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951. His son Fritz also played in the major leagues for the Dodgers and Angels from 1958 to 1961.  1909 – CF Jerry Benjamin was born in Montgomery, Alabama. He played in the Negro Leagues from 1931-48, spending the majority of his days with the Homestead Grays (1935-47) where he hit .300+ three times, played on four Negro League World Series-winning clubs and was named an All Star three times.   Nixey, out of uniform, in a 1916 Holmes Bread card 1916 – Manager Jimmy “Nixey” Callahan made the trip from Chicago to Pittsburgh to meet with owner Barney Dreyfuss and brainstorm over the coming campaign. Callahan was upbeat and told Pittsburgh Press beatman Ralph Davis that the team was set in the outfield and mound, with his middle infield the only soft spot with Hans Wagner moving to first base (although the only off-season move to improve it was to claim Greenfield Jimmy Smith off waivers), and to “emphatically” deny rumors that he was leaving to skipper another squad. Jimmy wasn’t a very good prognosticator – the Pirates started off 20-40 and he was fired. Hans Wagner briefly took the reins, followed by Hugo Bezdek, but it didn’t stop the bleeding. The Bucs finished 51-103 in 1917, in eighth (and last) place, 47 games behind the champion New York Giants. Nixey should have jumped if he had winter job offers; his seven year managerial career (he spent five earlier seasons with the White Sox and started his Pittsburgh gig in 1916) ended when he was axed.  1931 – RHP George “Red” Witt was born in Long Beach, California. Red tossed for the Bucs from 1957-61, going 10-13/3.93 as a starter/long man, and worked three games in relief against the Yankees in the 1960 World Series without surrendering a run. Witt went 11-16 with a 4.32 ERA and 156 strikeouts in 66 career games after spending 1962 with Houston and the Los Angeles Angels. He looked like a breakout candidate after a strong 1958 season, but arm woes followed and derailed his career.  1953 – The Supreme Court confirmed by a 7-2 decision that baseball is a sport, not a business, and therefore not subject to antitrust laws in a case brought before it by a minor league player who litigated his demotion from AAA to AA.   Scott Sauerbeck 1999 Sky Box Premium 1971 – LHP Scott Sauerbeck was born in Cincinnati. The lefty spent the first five years (1999-2003) of his MLB career with Pittsburgh after being selected as a Rule 5 pick from the Mets. He went 19-15-5/3.56 in his Pirates time. The southpaw retired in 2008 after seven big league campaigns. 2007 – The Italian nine beat Team USA 6-2 in the 2007 Baseball World Cup. Italy had not beaten the US for 21 years and had never beaten an American team with pro players. Pirate farmhands were complicit in the defeat – SS Brian Bixler committed a pair of errors (plus was picked off first base) while Andy LaRoche mishandled a pick-off try while playing first, allowing five unearned runs to the Italian club. Still, it was just a bump in the road as it was the USA’s only loss on their journey to the Cup title. Jeff Karstens, Steve Pearce, and Delwyn Young were also among the US players on the team who would suit up for the Pirates.",SPORTS,Fake
"CC Sabathia Returns To New York, But Should Fantasy Owners Care? ","The Yankees quest to upgrade their pitching staff has led them back to a familiar name, as earlier this week they resigned CC Sabathia to a one-year, $8 million contract.  At 38-years old (he’ll turn 39 during the 2019 season) it’s fair to wonder exactly what he has left in the tank, though the southpaw’s performance last season creates some intrigue:  153.0 IP 9 Wins 3.65 ERA 1.31 WHIP 140 Strikeouts (8.24 K/9) 51 Walks (3.00 BB/9) 44.4% Groundball Rate .295 BABIP  Those are respectable numbers, though we can’t overlook the innings.  He’s now worked 153 innings or fewer in back-to-back seasons and hasn’t eclipsed 180 innings since 2013.  In other words you know he’s going to miss time, and it’s possible the Yankees view him as just a partial option and not someone that’s going to take the ball every five days over the entire season.  In terms of his performance on the mound, the once hard thrower does appear to have made the transition to become more of a pitcher.  It also doesn’t appear that he benefited from much luck, given the BABIP (which came courtesy of a 28.5% Hard%) and 75.5% strand rate.  At the same time is anyone truly buying in to this type of ERA?  While Sabathia’s control isn’t a question, his strikeout rate and home runs allowed are.  The strikeout rate was a big jump over his recent marks, though he also altered his approach.  After introducing his cutter as a significant pitch in 2016, the usage went to a new level in 2018:",SPORTS,Fake

Panthers Pounded by Steelers in Offensive Avalanche 52-21 to Fall to 6-3 ,"The Panthers went right down the field on their opening drive, scoring an touchdown after a 9-play drive that covered 75-yards to go up quickly 7-0 on the Steelers.  The Cats should have warmed the bus up after that.  Pittsburgh needed just one play to tie the game up, and after that they continued what ended up being an onslaught, scoring 52 points, and slamming Carolina 52-21, dropping the Panthers to 6-3 on the season.  The 52 points put up by the Steelers ties a franchise record for the most points allowed in a game by the Panthers.  Find Out More >  84,084 The problem for the Panthers reared its ugly head again Thursday in terms of its inability to get the job done on the road. They have fallen behind by at least 14 points four times away from home this season.  This time they would not come back, as the Steelers put any thoughts of a comeback away by scoring on their first three drives of the second half, this after building a 31-14 halftime lead.  They were torched all night by the pinpoint passing of Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger, who missed on just three passes in the runaway win, throwing for 328 yards with five touchdowns.  Cam Newton was under a heavy Steelers rush most of the night, as he was knocked around, getting beat up to the tune of five sacks, seven hits and too many pressures to count.  Newton did post an impressive QB rating, but forget that and consider that they simply didn’t have any answers to a Steelers offense that did whatever they wanted.  The Panthers put up 75 yards on the their opening drive, and ended the night with just 242 total yards with 18 first downs, and on third downs they were ineffective, going 4-for-11 (the Steelers were 8-of-11).

Florida State Opponent Preview: Notre Dame ,"Notre Dame  While not quite the performance I would of liked, I did see changes to the game last week that I do feel re-assured in the Taggart era. This post will not be quite as spirited, despite the opponent Florida State faces. Notre Dame is an elite program in 2018, and I wouldn’t expect much from Florida State in this match-up. Despite learning that Ian Book will hit the sidelines this game due to injury, their back-up quarterback was fully capable of beating playoff contender Michigan at home. Florida State is nowhere near the capabilities of Michigan this season and, unfortunately, will now see their 9th (!) different look to start at Offensive Line in the 10 games overall this season. Florida State, ironically enough, made the moves on offense last week to beat NC State thanks to an inspired debut from James Blackman and play calling from OC Walt Bell. The defense (and questionable officiating) made the game a no-contest, a concerning look considering the Seminoles boast a very talented and efficient defense.  Final Verdict  Florida State, to put it plainly, doesn’t have what it takes to pull the upset in South Bend. It’ll be below freezing by the 7:30 kickoff. The snow will curl, the winds will howl, and the passing game will take a hit for both teams. The backup at Notre Dame will likely struggle to run their offense with any efficiency. Likewise, the Noles will be dependent on a run-game that has been near non-existent this season. Blackman can run the offense more efficiently than Deondre, but the passing game will be tough in these conditions, leaving our offensive line to make holes for the run game (which has not happened all season). The offensive line will face an elite defense in Notre Dame. While our defense can stop the run, making this game closer than it should be, the suspect secondary will afford Notre Dame the edge at home and in a climate that is a bit too-cold for southern blood.  To make a bowl and keep their longest-active bowl streak alive, Florida State will need to win-out against Boston College and the University of Florida. The win won’t happen against the Fighting Irish.",SPORTS,Fake

Jets Downward Spiral Ends With Bills ,"Last week’s loss to the Miami Dolphins has finally done it. The media, sports pundits, and pretty much the rest of the nation have lost all hope for the NY Jets. There is already talk of the pros and cons of a mid-season head-coaching change. It’s gotten so bad that Todd Bowles is 3rd highest on the list at YouWager and top sportsbooks to be the next NFL coach fired.  Things Are Tough All Over  Like Cheech and Chong said, “things are rough all over.” It isn’t just Todd Bowles who’s sitting in the hot seat. The hottest seat of all is in Denver. Vance Joseph tops the list at +400 after taking a two-point loss to the Texans last Sunday.  Next up is Dirk Koetter, who’s been sitting in a blazing chair for quite some time. Quite frankly, I’m surprised that he still has his job in Tampa Bay. Mike McCarthy and Steve Wilks are also in directly in the line of fire. The disappointment is well spread around … just look at Jon Gruden and the one-win Raiders.  Find Out More >  84,659 But On The Bright Side  Sean McDermott is also on that above list, just closer towards the bottom where John Harbaugh is living. And despite the downward spiral the Jets are in, the Buffalo Bills are even worse. The Bills are averaging a league-worst 10.67 points per game and it’s even worse on the road. Buffalo can’t even break double-digits while out on the highway, so it’s no wonder that the oddsmakers have the NY Jets as a full touchdown favorite at MetLife this Sunday.  Facing the Buffalo Bills is like a light that is suddenly shining brightly when you thought that you were trapped down the wrong end of a dark and scary hallway with monsters clawing out of the walls. This is a chance to the Jets to streak towards the light and gain some confidence back by taking advantage of a team that is in total offensive disarray. We can’t point the finger to any single QB or other skill position player at Buffalo. Whether Allen, Peterman, or Anderson play the results are the same: an offense that can’t get the job done.  Stats That We Should Consider  There is a whole laundry list of injured and questionable players on both sides here, but it has been that way for a while. So we should expect the law of averages to be affected too much. Right now the biggest average to look at is their offensive potential. The Jets average 22 points per game overall and 26 points per game while in East Rutherford. This is going against the Bills average of 9.60 points per game as the visiting team. The Bills are so pitiful offensively that they don’t even break 230 yards of total offense per game … talk about rough all over. They are 22nd in the league running the ball on the road and dead last in passing yards. Meanwhile, the Jets are still middling at No. 17 at stopping the run and better than average at stopping the pass at No. 13.  Buffalo has only won one of its last six games. Buffalo has only won one of its last six road games. Buffalo has only covered two of six games against the Jets in NJ. The Jets are 9-4 against the spread at home. The Jets are 4-2 against the spread at home vs. the Bills. The Jets have a 6-2 record against the Bills while playing at home. It’s looking pretty grim for the Bills and I have not lost all hope for the NY Jets. Although I wouldn’t recommend throwing a ton of money at the Gang this weekend, the number has moved down from a 9.5-point opening line to just 7 at the moment. I will definitely throw a few bucks on Gang Green at this number. If the number slides down to 6.5, jump all over it! If it stays at seven bet responsibly. If it moves back to the wrong side of 7, stay away.  The post Jets Downward Spiral Ends With Bills appeared first on JetNation.com (NY Jets Blog & Forum).",SPORTS,Fake

Week 10 Rankings (2018): Top 15 Kickers ,"Here we are for another week searching for the best value at kicker. While there is clearly some thought and strategy to it, unfortunately it is far from an exact science as kickers sometimes just don’t deliver and to some degree are at the mercy of their offenses. One kicker I was high on last week, Jason Myers, was hurt as a Jets’ penalty pushed them further back which ultimately led to a missed field goal. So now that I got that frustration out of the way, let’s take a look at how this week’s options rank:  Adam Vinatieri – Indianapolis Colts – vs. Jacksonville Harrison Butker – Kansas City Chiefs – vs. Arizona Greg Zuerlein – LA Rams – vs. Seattle Stephen Gostkowski – New England Patriots – at Tennessee Will Lutz – New Orleans Saints – at Cincinnati Cody Parkey – Chicago Bears – vs. Detroit Mason Crosby – Green Bay Packers – vs. Miami Giorgio Tavecchio – Atlanta Falcons – at Cleveland Robbie Gould – San Francisco 49ers – vs. NY Giants Brett Maher – Dallas Cowboys – at Philadelphia Jason Myers – NY Jets – vs. Buffalo Dustin Hopkins – Washington Redskins – at Tampa Bay Ryan Succop – Tennessee Titans – vs. New England Matt Prater – Detroit Lions – at Chicago Jake Elliot – Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Dallas Thoughts:  While the Jaguars do have a strong defense, perhaps not as fierce as previously expected, they still don’t shut out their opponents. With that being said Jacksonville has allowed the third most points to opposing kickers, and this week the potential beneficiary of that is Adam Vinatieri. The veteran kicker has yet to show signs of age, and with the match-up in Indianapolis this week we also don’t have to worry about the weather. Coming off his bye week Vinatieri is owned is 55% of ESPN leagues and he is just shy of being a Top 12 kicker. Overall he has missed four kicks (two of 13 field goal attempts and two of 23 extra points) with one of those field goals coming from beyond 50 yards. There is only one week in which he hasn’t attempted a field goal, and he has reached double digits in scoring in five of eight weeks. One kicker who made his presence felt last week, Giorgio Tavecchio, is owned in just 5% of ESPN leagues and as long as he is filling in for Matt Bryant he worth considering. Tavecchio has yet to miss a kick in his two games with Atlanta, and three of his four field foals have come from beyond 40 yards. The only thing that limited his production last week is the fact that Atlanta reached the end zone five times, which meant he had five extra points. Cleveland’s defense is better than Washington’s, but the Falcons shouldn’t have any issues moving the ball which will give Tavecchio plenty of opportunities. While no one expected the 49ers’ offense to do what they did last week, Robbie Gould has been consistently successful so far this season. While we can’t ignore Nick Mullins success, we also have to note that it came against the Raiders who are most certainly a team in disarray. As far as opponents go, it doesn’t get that much more difficult against the Giants and Gould gets to face the team allowing the most points to opposing kickers. In reality Gould really has had just one dud week, and he has six field goals from 40-49 yards while missing just two kicks (one field and one extra point) all season. That is good enough to make him a Top 10 option, both for this week and the remainder of the season. ** PRE-ORDER SALE ** Pre-order Rotoprofessor’s 2018 Fantasy Baseball Draft Guide for just $6.75!!

Week 10 Rankings (2018): Top 15 Defenses ,"As we look forward to this week it is clear that there are a multitude of match-ups that are far from appealing. What that does mean is that from the perspective of fantasy defenses there are some options out there. While they might not truly jump off the page at you, there should at least be limited risk. With that being said, let’s take a look at how our options rank:  New York Jets – vs. Buffalo Kansas City Chiefs – vs. Arizona LA Rams – vs. Seattle Chicago Bears – vs. Detroit Indianapolis Colts – vs. Jacksonville Washington Redskins – at Tampa Bay LA Chargers – at Oakland Carolina Panthers – at Pittsburgh Buffalo Bills – at NY Jets Atlanta Falcons – at Cleveland Jacksonville Jaguars – at Indianapolis Cleveland Browns – vs. Atlanta New England Patriots – at Tennessee San Francisco 49ers – vs. NY Giants Miami Dolphins – at Green Bay Thoughts:  Just because the Bills are pretty close to being unwatchable and generally ignored from a fantasy perspective, it doesn’t mean we should just dismiss them. And no I’m not looking to do anything crazy and count on Nathan Peterman to provide fantasy value, instead I am looking at their defense. While the offense doesn’t do their teammates any favors, Buffalo’s defense has held their own. They are facing an offense that isn’t much better than their own in Week 10, and at 19.6% ownership they should be targeted. The New York Jets have failed to generate a consistent running game, their center can’t be counted on to snap the ball cleanly, penalties are an issue, options at the skill positions are lacking and Sam Darnold will also be sidelined. While the Bills only have six interceptions under their belt, they do have 22 sacks. This isn’t exactly an every week play, but the Bills should be a popular option for Week 10. The focus is always going to be on Kansas City’s offense, but while their defense isn’t what it was in years past it also shouldn’t be ignored. In fact they are still coming in as a borderline Top 5 defense, and their opponent this week (Arizona) has allowed the second most points to opposing defenses so far this season. The Chiefs with their consistent quarterback pressure (26 sacks) should be able to take advantage of Josh Rosen. With an interception in each of the past three weeks, Kansas City should continue that streak against the rookie quarterback and with the Chiefs’ offense likely to have a strong game, Rosen will be forced to play catch-up which should put him on his heels. One defense that doesn’t have the best of reputations is the Colts. Owned in just 14% of leagues Indianapolis faces a Jaguars team, that while they appear to be getting Leonard Fournette back are allowing the seventh most points to opposing fantasy defenses. In five of their eight games the Colts have allowed 28 points or more, they still have yet to have negative scoring day. With nine interceptions, seven fumble recoveries and 19 sacks, Indianapolis does enough to generate some value. ** PRE-ORDER SALE ** Pre-order Rotoprofessor’s 2018 Fantasy Baseball Draft Guide for just $6.75!!

England squad v All Blacks does itself no favours ,"According to the old cliché, the definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.   Zach Mercer: should be starting And so, while Chris Ashton’s first start for England since 2014 may be the headline news from today’s announcement of the England squad to take on the All Blacks on Saturday, it is the selection of two second rows on the England bench, to the exclusion of the excellent Zach Mercer, that is the biggest cause for concern.  I would have had Mercer – playing out of his skin this season – starting at number 8, but his entire omission from the matchday squad means that England will have no proper back row cover on Saturday, with either one of Courtney Lawes or Maro Itoje probably having to fill in at flanker if required.  Let’s be clear, Lawes/Itoje at flanker has never worked previously for England and there’s absolutely nothing to suggest that it will be successful this time against what is probably the most effective back row trio in world rugby.  I had hoped that Eddie Jones might have learned from previous experience. It seems I was mistaken.  ",SPORTS,Fake

Subsidised plug-in cars driven on fuel ,"Company car drivers don’t have time to wait for recharges when working, even if they could find an available charging point, and usually they aren’t personally paying for the fuel anyway. Farcical waste of subsidies, but at least the batteries won’t be worn out when these vehicles hit the second-hand market.  Plug-in hybrids bought for fleets with subsidies may never have been charged, research for BBC shows.  Tens of thousands of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) bought with generous government grants may be burning as much fuel as combustion-engine cars.  ​Data compiled for the BBC suggests that such vehicles in corporate fleets averaged just 40 miles per gallon (mpg), when they could have done 130.   Find Out More >  57,691 Many drivers may never have unwrapped their charging cables, The Miles Consultancy said.  Subsidies for new PHEVs were recently scrapped, after seven years.  The plug-in grant was introduced in 2011, gifting buyers up to £4,500 off new cars. The incentive helped the UK become the biggest market for PHEVs in Europe.  The majority of the tens of thousands of eligible vehicles sold were bought by company fleets, including more than 70% of the 37,000 plug-in hybrids sold so far in 2018.  But data from The Miles Consultancy, a Cheshire firm which advises 300 blue-chip companies on fuel management, reveals that many businesses simply used the grant to save on buying regular cars.  Mileage records from 1,500 models, including Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Volvo vehicles, showed an average real-world mpg of 39.27, against an average manufacturer advertised mpg of 129.68.  Figures for 2,432 hybrids – including non plug-in varieties – showed an average real-world mpg of 49.06, still vastly lower than the potential range.  “There are some examples where employees aren’t even charging these vehicles up,” said Paul Hollick, The Miles Consultancy’s managing director.  “The charge cables are still in the boot, in a cellophane wrapper, while the company and the employee are going in and out of petrol stations, paying for all of this additional fuel.  This practice, he added, was “ridiculous”.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake

Judge Presiding Over Exxon Climate Lawsuit Agrees To Divest From The Oil Giant ,"A New York judge agreed to sell his stock in ExxonMobil to resolve a potential conflict of interest flagged by the New York attorney general’s office after it filed its lawsuit alleging the oil giant misled investors over climate change risk.  Responding to the state’s request that he recuse himself from the case, Judge Barry R. Ostrager said in a hearing Wednesday in New York Supreme Court that he would sell his Exxon stock if New York withdraws its request and waives any claim of conflict of interest.   Ostrager, 71, had held up to $250,000 in Exxon shares, according to the judge’s latest financial disclosure form filed with the Ethics Commission for the Unified Court System.

Déjà Vu? Obama-Appointed Judge Blocks Keystone XL Pipeline ,"A federal judge moved Thursday to block President Donald Trump’s decision to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline without providing a reason for overturning the Obama administration’s ruling on the project.  Judge Brian Morris found that the Trump administration did not account for how a decline in oil prices might affect the pipeline’s viability.  The government’s analysis failed to address how greenhouse gas emissions might increase as a result of the project’s approval, he noted.  “The Department instead simply discarded prior factual findings related to climate change to support its course reversal,” he wrote.  Morris also cited a U.S. Supreme Court noting: “An agency cannot simply disregard contrary or inconvenient factual determinations that it made in the past.”  Find Out More >  58,263 The Department of State issued a 300-page report in July finding that the Keystone extension could damage wetlands across parts of Nebraska, though most of the impact would be temporary.  The report was required after the Nebraska Public Service Commission voted in November 2017 to allow TransCanada to build the multi-billion dollar pipeline only on an alternative route.  The Trump administration prepared a new environmental assessment for the new Nebraska route.  Morris also dinged the Trump administration for failing to address the Obama administration’s moves to keep rising global temperatures at low levels for denying the pipeline permit.  Former President Barack Obama had nominated Morris in 2013 to fill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana.  Obama vetoed a bipartisan bill in 2015 approving the 1,200-mile long pipeline.  Trump later signed an executive order approving both projects subject to regulatory review.  Activists cheered Morris’s decision. “Keystone XL would be a disaster for the climate and for the people and wildlife of this country,” Jackie Prange, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement Thursday.  The White House has not responded to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. Trump or TransCanada, the company behind the project, could appeal Morris’s ruling to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
"Coveted Carl Sagan Prize Goes To Scientist Who Admitted To Fraud, Conning Think Tank ","A prominent California-based scientist will be awarded a prestigious science award Friday, despite the fact he admitted to obtaining confidential documents from a conservative think tank “under someone else’s name” before leaking them to reporters.  Pacific Institute President-emeritus Peter Gleick will receive the Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization, named for the late science communicator and physicist Carl Sagan. Gleick will be presented with the prize at Wonderfest in San Francisco.   Chosen by a committee, the Sagan prize is awarded to Bay Area scientists who progress “the public understanding and appreciation of science.” The prize also comes with $5,000.  “Sagan would be proud to know that Peter Gleick, so renowned for his research and his outreach, has received Wonderfest’s Sagan Prize for 2018,” Wonderfest’s founding executive director Tucker Hiatt said in a statement issued in late August.  Find Out More >  58,307 Gleick has been a prolific author and outspoken proponent of policies to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Gleick is also a critic of skeptics of catastrophic global warming, whom he’s called “deniers.” (SEE ALSO: Building his legacy of hate, Peter Gleick mocks the death of John Coleman)  In fact, Gleick admitted in 2012 his hatred for those who disagree with him on climate science led to a “serious lapse of my own professional judgment and ethics.”  Tomorrow in San Francisco, @PeterGleick will receive the 2018 Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization. The prize recognizes researchers who have contributed to the public understanding and appreciation of #science: https://t.co/FZnd9iq1lH pic.twitter.com/pxa5xsK7l9  — Pacific Institute (@PacificInstitut) November 8, 2018  Gleick admitted in a 2012 Huffington Post blog post he used “someone else’s name” to extract confidential internal documents and sensitive donor information from the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank skeptical of man-made global warming.  Gleick then leaked those documents, including one that might have been fake, to reporters. At the time, Heartland kept its donors private, in part, because activists had harassed them in the past. Gleick did this while chairing the American Geophysical Union’s panel on “Scientific Ethics.”  “My judgment was blinded by my frustration with the ongoing efforts — often anonymous, well-funded, and coordinated — to attack climate science and scientists and prevent this debate, and by the lack of transparency of the organizations involved,” Gleick wrote in 2012.  Gleick was a frequent critic of Heartland’s, routinely criticizing the group for not publicly disclosing its donors.  Gleick posed as a Heartland Institute board member to extract internal funding documents from the group, the group’s spokesman says.  A former Heartland board member speculated Gleick was the source of the leaked documents three days before the renowned scientists admitted to it.  “Nevertheless I deeply regret my own actions in this case. I offer my personal apologies to all those affected,” Gleick wrote.  The Heartland Institute bills itself as the most prominent think tank that promotes skepticism of man-made global warming.  The group routinely releases reports to counter the mainstream climate science narrative put out by the United Nations.  “Wonderfest brings disgrace upon itself and sullies the memory of Carl Sagan by giving this award to an admitted liar and thief,” Heartland spokesman Jim Lakely told The Daily Caller News Foundation.  Gleick’s actions, spurred by a possibly false document sent to him “anonymously,” allowed Greenpeace and other environmental groups to pressure Heartland Institute donors to withdraw their funding. GM and Diageo stopped funding Heartland amid pressure.  “Peter Gleick’s reward for impersonating a member of Heartland’s board of directors via email, stealing private documents, and writing a fake ‘memo’ to smear The Heartland Institute should have been a prison sentence,” Lakely said. “Instead, he is regularly celebrated by the radical environmental movement.”  Gleick’s admission earned him condemnation from across the ideological spectrum. Columnist Megan McArdle, then writing for The Atlantic, wrote at the time, “I confess to wondering whether he doesn’t have some sort of underlying medical condition that requires urgent treatment.”  A Washington Post writer bemoaned that Gleick has “done more to discredit himself and his work than he has to expose cynicism and collusion among global-warming deniers.”  Gleick resigned from AGU’s ethics board and also from the National Center for Science Education. However, Gleick was restored to his post as Pacific Institute president after a three-month investigation into his conduct.  Heartland Institute lawyers prepared a lengthy slideshow of evidence of Gleick’s fraud, including emails and document metadata, for federal prosecutors. The government did not prosecute Gleick.  Neither Wonderfest’s Hiatt nor Gleick responded to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.  “I’m thrilled to be honored with the Sagan Prize,” Gleick said in a late August statement. “Carl Sagan’s early efforts to bring science challenges and solutions to the public and policymakers was an inspiration to me, and has encouraged a whole generation of scientists now willing to speak up on the critical challenges of our day.”  Update: Wonderfest founding executive director Tucker Hiatt gave the following statement to TheDCNF after press time.  In 2012, Peter Gleick had a lapse of judgment and (as described in the Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gleick as “Heartland Institute Incident”) dissembled to the anti-climate-change Heartland Institute, allowing an employee to believe he was a member of its board. < https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/science/earth/in-heartland-institute-leak-a-plan-to-discredit-climate-teaching.html?pagewanted=all>  Gleick was attempting to confirm material previously sent anonymously to him that revealed planned Heartland Institute projects to mislead the public on issues of climate change, and even to engage in potentially illegal activity (supporting candidates for office). The information was important, but tarnished because it was confirmed through unethical means.  In this document  https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heartland-institute-documents_b_1289669.html as well as in others, Gleick publicly has expressed sincere remorse for his ethical lapse. Since then, he has put his head down and continued to do good work on both the scientific and public fronts, and has continued to enjoy the respect of his peers in the scientific community as well as the appreciation of the public he has continued to enlighten.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake

"Rize Expands Functional 3D Printing with More Materials, Full Color ","The world is in full color, and now so is functional 3D printing with Rize’s latest introduction.  Today Rize announces a significant portfolio enhancement, unveiling the full-color XRIZE desktop additive manufacturing system and expanding the materials capabilities of the Rize One 3D printer.  Let’s start with what’s new with the Rize One.  The Rize One at Rize HQ [Image: Fabbaloo]The Rize One at Rize HQ [Image: Fabbaloo]Since its market debut in 2016, Rize’s technology has included the capability to mark parts with some color, building on this inkjet ability over the years to present Digitally Augmented Additive Manufacturing Parts that utilize voxel-level control to securely mark 3D printed parts. Having brought Rizium One Black material to market earlier this year for another popular color option, Rize now continues its path in responding to customer demand with two new material options.  Find Out More >  58,915    Rizium Carbon and Rizium Endura have joined the Rizium material family. The former, reinforced with carbon fiber, is designed for functional prototyping for manufacturing, while the fiber-reinforced Rizium Endura offers high accuracy and high impact strength. The latter is also compatible with Rize’s full-color inks, which leads us to…  XRIZE.  Full-color 3D printing has represented something of a holy grail — especially when it comes to functional parts.  I was fortunate to find myself in Boston recently, and had the time to get hands-on with these new full-color parts and to hear first-hand from Rize CEO Andy Kalambi, Vice President of Product Kishore Boyalakuntla, and Vice President of Marketing Julie Reece.  L-R: Kishore, Julie, and Andy at Rize HQ [Image: Fabbaloo]L-R: Kishore, Julie, and Andy at Rize HQ [Image: Fabbaloo]  “What we have with XRIZE is what we like to call the world’s first safe, strong, multi-material desktop industrial printer with minimal post-processing,” Boyalakuntla explained.  “What we’re seeing is that color 3D printing is very messy, and you often get parts that are not functional — or if they are, they are very expensive. The innovation our team did is very unique; we don’t talk about it enough but it really is voxel-level… With true color capabilities, the imagination is the limit. The world is in color, right?”  Kalambi looked to the world of 2D printing as the precedent for the adoption of color.  “With the first introductions of color 2D printers, people thought they knew some uses, but the users kept expanding on that. No one buys black and white printers anymore,” he said.  “Today, we believe color will redefine how people look at 3D printed parts. Never before has this been possible except with expense and complexity attached to making those parts. We wanted to maintain simplicity and safety while creating functional, lifelike parts. We’ve seen functional parts that are not lifelike and lifelike parts that are not functional. Now, we push toward new end users, toward marketing professionals, designers, architects, and not just engineers; those kinds of applications will explode. We live in color. We are bringing 3D printing to the real world, in a way.”  As we spoke, I handled a few full-color parts, including a topographical map and a faithful replica of a Fanta can, both fully readable. I surreptitiously worked to bend or break another part, but it didn’t budge; after I came clean about having been trying to squeeze it, Boyalakuntla encouraged me to try harder. Still nothing.  “We are not going to announce anything that’s not working,” Boyalakuntla said with a smile. “And people want color. TV, 2D, anything that is color explodes.”  Squeezing this did nothing. [Image: Fabbaloo]Squeezing this did nothing. [Image: Fabbaloo]  The XRIZE jets CMYK inks during the printing process with its Augmented Polymer Deposition technology, and jets RELASE INK between part and support for the easy-removal capabilities that drew early attention to Rize.  Rize notes specs for the new system as:  Four-channel color and dedicated Release Ink channel Device dimensions: 21.4” H x 36” W x 25.4” D (535 x 915 x 647mm) Build volume: 12”x 8” x 8” (310 x 200 x 200mm) Weight: 135 lbs (61kg) Layer thickness: .250mm or .125mm Resolution: x/y 300dpi; Z 200dpi at .125mm layer thickness Accuracy: X/Y: +/- .127mm, or +/-.003mm/mm, whichever is greater and Z: +/- layer thickness (.250mm or .125mm) XRIZE [Image: Rize]XRIZE [Image: Rize]Along with the XRIZE system and expansion of offerings for the Rize One, today’s announcements also include Rize Connect.  Debuting at formnext, Rize Connect represents a logical step to take advantage of IoT and the intelligence that comes with that to help customers design and get feedback and analytics, Boyalakuntla explained.  “It captures valuable information and gives users proactive feedback to help them sequence things faster, better, and to execute what they need to do, to maximize throughput on a fleet of printers — both the Rize One and XRIZE,” he continued.  Rize will be showcasing all these announcements at formnext — as well as offering a show-only special for the new XRIZE. Any orders placed during formnext for an XRIZE (with a $55K MSRP) will become a two-for-one bundle that also includes a Rize One. The Rize One will ship immediately, and the XRIZE will ship upon general availability in 2019. Beta units will be shipping soon after formnext.  ",TECHNOLOGY,Fake

Historically the authors report, “This specimen is exposed on a limestone slab in dorsal view and was assigned to Pterosauria based on its perceived thin bone walls. Seeley (1880) noted that the arrangement of bones was more crocodilian than pterosaurian and considered this construction diagnostic of the new taxon. Significantly he (Seeley 1880: 30) stated: “I shall be quite prepared to find that all the ornithosaurians from Stonesfield belong to this or an allied genus which had Rhamphorhynchus for its nearest ally.” In the LRT crocodilians are closer to birds than pterosaurs are.

Rhamphocephalus chronologically precedes the Solnhofenbirds by several million years making it the oldest known euornithine bird.  Is the Middle Jurassic too early for a toothed bird? Perhaps not. Remembet that all of the Late Jurassic Solnhofen birds, traditionally named as one genus, Archaeopteryx, already represent a diverse radiation of taxa, suggesting an earlier genesis for that radiation. Rhamphocephalus indicates that the original bird radiation had its genesis at least 15 million years earlier.   It is unfortunate that O’Sullivan and Martill attempted to force fit the skull specimen into a crocodilian clade when no aspect of the thin-walled, goose-sized skull of Rhamphocephalus is crocodilian (Fig. 2)… or choristoderan (when flipped backwards!!). Adding Rhamphocephalus to the LRT gives it a single most parsimonious sister among all the toothed birds and a special Middle Jurassic place in the origin of birds story. All the details fit.  Working with a high-resolution image of Rhamphocephalus (Fig. 3) copied from a PDF of the paper by O’Sullivan and Martill made this all possible.  Once again, to determine the affinities of a specimen it is more important to have a wide gamut of taxa to work with than to have firsthand access to the specimen itself. No one likes this method, but it clearly works time after time and to not use it invites discredit.  USE THE LRT. That’s what it is here for.  References O’Sullivan M and Martill DM 2018.

The Homebrew Key Is A Key Which Opens Your Doors AND Your Beers ,"Would you say bottle openers are useless? Some would… until they find themselves in a situation which needs one. But since most bottle openers are single purpose and slightly more useful than a rock, not too many folks carry one on their person. But, what if it had more uses?  When designer David Enrico came across a bottle opener shaped like a key, he knew the answer to lugging around a heavy bottle opener wasn’t far behind. Instead of making another key-shaped bottle opener, he instead made a bottle opener which also serves as an actual key. The end result was the Homebrew Key.  Homebrew Key  Homebrew Key  Find Out More >  59,302 The design philosophy behind the Homebrew Key is pretty simple: make a non-obtrusive key on a keyring which opens both doors and bottles. Though the body is a tad larger in order to fit the bottle opening portion of the key, the Homebrew Key fits on your keyring like any other house key.  Homebrew Key  And just like any house key, this bottle-and-house opening key starts off as either a blank SC1 or KW1 key. To get it to actually open doors, you need to bring it to your local locksmith. You could try cutting the key yourself to save some money, but the chances of you jamming up your door would be far greater than if you took it to a professional.  Homebrew Key  Homebrew Key  David Enrico carved out the first Homebrew Key using a drill, saw, incisors, and a file, but the resulting key ended up looking like something Michael Myers would use. The succeeding Homebrew Keys were made using a CNC machine and given an added curve on the opener and made studier.  The Kickstarter project is live, so if you’re having trouble opening both your doors and your brews, you should definitely give the Homebrew Key a look.

The Children's Crusade: Thousands of Children March to Holy Land but Never Return ,"The Children’s Crusade is one of the more unusual events that occurred in Medieval England. In the year 1212,  tens of thousands of self-proclaimed, unarmed crusading children set out from northern France and western Germany to regain Jerusalem from the Muslims. While never actually receiving official sanction, the so-called crusade was a disaster. None of the children reached the Holy Land, many were said to have been sold into slavery, and thousands never returned at all.  The Major Crusades  Between the 11th and 13th centuries, seven major Crusades were launched by Christians in Europe against Muslims that were in control of the Holy Land. In addition to these major military campaigns to the East, the Latin Roman Catholic Church also sanctioned numerous minor Crusades against her enemies. These included the Albigensian Crusade (1208–1241), aimed at eradicating the Cathar heretics of southern France, and the Northern Crusades (1193–1290) against the pagans of Northern Europe. Yet, one of the most bizarre episodes in the history of the Crusades is perhaps the so-called ‘Children’s Crusade’, said to have taken place in 1212.    According to a 13th century source, the Chronica regia Coloniensis (‘Royal Chronicle of Cologne’), the Children’s Crusade began around Easter or Pentecost of 1212:  Many thousands of boys, ranging in age from six years to full maturity, left the plows or carts they were driving, the flocks which they were pasturing, and anything else which they were doing. This they did despite the wishes of their parents, relatives, and friends who sought to make them draw back. Suddenly one ran after another to take the cross. Thus, by groups of twenty, or fifty, or a hundred, they put up banners and began to journey to Jerusalem.  Find Out More >  59,245 ‘The Departure: An Episode of the Child's Crusade 13th Century’ by Joanna Mary Boyce  ‘The Departure: An Episode of the Child’s Crusade 13th Century’ by Joanna Mary Boyce ( Wikimedia Commons )  The children claimed that it was the will of the Divine that prompted them to undertake this Crusade. In spite of this, their expedition did not achieve its intention in the end, “Some were turned back at Metz, others at Piacenza, and others even at Rome. Still others got to Marseilles, but whether they crossed to the Holy Land or what their end was is uncertain.” The author ends the account on a grim note, “One thing is sure: that of the many thousands who rose up, only very few returned.”  Stephen and Nicholas: Leaders of the Children’s Crusade More recent versions of the story have suggested that there were actually two separate groups of children involved in this Crusade. The first group came from France, led by a peasant boy called Stephen of Cloyes. The boy claimed that Christ had appeared to him in a dream, and delivered a letter from Heaven. Stephen assembled a group of young followers in the city of Vendôme, and then marched to Saint-Denis, just outside Paris, where he intended to pass the contents of his ‘letter’ to the French king, Philip II. The king, however, was not amused by the young crusader, did not even bothered meeting him, and told them to go home. Although some took the king’s advice, and went home, many others took their place. It is said that Stephen succeeded in gathering 30,000 children, and led them to Marseilles, where they would cross the Mediterranean to the Holy Land.  ‘The Children’s Crusade’ by Gustave Doré  ‘The Children’s Crusade’ by Gustave Doré ( Wikimedia Commons )  At the same time, another ‘army’ of child crusaders was gathering in Germany. Their leader was a boy from Cologne called Nicholas, and he is reported to have attracted about 50,000 followers. Unlike Stephen, however, Nicholas’ followers included a small number of adults as well, though they were probably not in charge. These crusades travelled from Germany to Italy across the Alps, and are said to have even met the pope in Rome. Whilst the pope praised the children for their bravery, he also told them that they were too young to undertake such a venture. With that, most of the crusaders returned to Germany, though many of them would die on the way. A few determined youngsters boarded ships intended for the Holy Land, and then disappeared completely from history.   ‘The Children’s Crusade, 1212’ ( Wikimedia Commons )   Although the Children’s Crusade is referenced in more than 50 chronicles dating from the 13th century, many question the accounts that have been given, and suspect they were at best an embellished version of what actually occurred.  Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... The Children’s Crusade was not a crusade in its truest sense as the Pope did not call for it nor sanction it. Rather it was a popular movement whose details remain obscure and hard to trace, which was spurred on by religious fervour and fanaticism that sadly resulted in thousands of deaths.   What Makes a “Children’s Crusade?” Some have even questioned if the Children’s Crusade was even a movement led by youth at all. For example, Peter Raedts reviewed documentation of the crusade and suggested in 1977 that they were, as History.com writes, “participants in the Children’s Crusade had existed on the margins of society. They may have believed it was up to poor and marginalized people to take up the flag for Christianity after the first Crusades failed. Raedts concluded the crusaders were not really children, but poor people […]”",TECHNOLOGY,Fake

"Half Of Peer-Reviewed Climate Science Results Non-Replicable, Flawed ","“A number of biases internal and external to the scientific community contribute to perpetuating the perception of ocean calamities in the absence of robust evidence.”  – Duarte et al., 2015  Half-of-Peer-Reviewed-Science-Flawed-Larcombe-Ridd-2018  Image Source: Larcombe and Ridd, 2018Within a matter of days after the press release for a newly published Nature paper spewed the usual it’s-worse-than-we-thought headlines throughout the ‘alarmosphere’ (Washington Post, BBC, New York Times), the paper’s results were assessed to have “major problems” by the author of multiple CO2 climate sensitivity papers (Lewis and Curry, 2015, 2018).

Find Out More >  59,913 And yet the paper was able to pass through peer review anyway.  Dr. Michael Mann’s error-riddled 2016 paper A few years ago Dr. Michael Mann was the lead author of an embarrassingly non-scientific paper fraught with glaring methodological and statistical errors.  A post-publication reviewer (statistician Dr. William Briggs) wrote in his point-by-point critique of the paper that “Mann’s errors are in no way unique or rare; indeed, they are banal and ubiquitous.”  Despite the glaring errors, the paper made it through peer-review and was published in Nature‘s Scientific Reports journal anyway.   70% of “hoax” papers can get published in peer-reviewed journals Analyses indicate that “fake peer review” often goes undetected, and as much as 70% of deliberately-written “hoax” papers with ridiculous and meaningless results can get published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  “Any reviewer with more than a high-school knowledge of chemistry and the ability to understand a basic data plot should have spotted the paper’s shortcomings immediately. Its experiments are so hopelessly flawed that the results are meaningless. … The hoax paper was accepted by a whopping 157 of the journals and rejected by only 98. Of the 106 journals that did conduct peer review, 70% accepted the paper…”  (Murphy, 2017  The Failure of Peer Review)  A new paper cites analyses that find half of the peer-reviewed science results are flawed, not replicable Earlier this year, a review paper (Larcombe and Ridd, 2018) published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin delivered a stinging rebuke to the modern version of science’s disturbing lack of replicability and verifiability.  Half-of-Peer-Reviewed-Science-Wrong-Larcombe-Ridd-2018  Image Source: Larcombe and Ridd, 2018  The authors go on to detail a large volume of examples when peer-review failed to detect errors in Great Barrier Reef (GBR) coral research.  Confirmation bias appears to permeate the peer-reviewed literature, slanted in the direction of finding evidence for a catastrophic decline in coral health.  This isn’t the first time that marine research has been called out for overselling calamity (see Cressey, 2015, “Ocean ‘calamities’ oversold, say researchers – Team calls for more scepticism in marine research.”) and falling “into a mode of groupthink that can damage the credibility of the ocean sciences.”  As just a single example among the many provided, Larcombe and Ridd reviewed the De’ath et al. (2009) study in which an “unprecedented” decline in GBR corals was alleged to have occurred between 1990-2005.  After a reanalysis of the measurements and methods used, Larcombe and Ridd used corrected data to show there has actually been “a small increase in the growth rate” of corals since the early 1900s (see below image) instead of the dramatic decline after the 1990s documented in the peer-reviewed paper.  These errors slipped past the reviewers’ notice too.   The publication of flawed results has seemingly become so common that it’s no longer even surprising.  “This paper [De’ath et al. (2009): Declining coral calcification on the Great Barrier Reef.] studied 328 corals on the GBR and indicated a 14% reduction in growth rates between 1990 and 2005. It stated that the corals of the GBR are declining “at a rate unprecedented in coral records reaching back 400 years”. Subsequent reanalysis of the data indicated that the apparent recent reduction in growth rate was caused by a) problems with the physical measurements of calcification, which systematically biased recent growth bands to give lower growth rates (D’Olivio et al., 2013; Ridd et al., 2013), and b) an unjustified assumption that coral growth rate does not change with the age of the coral (Ridd et al., 2013). With these taken into account, the dramatic fall in growth rate after 1990 is no longer evident, and a small increase in growth rates since the early 1900’s appears (Fig. 6). Further, D’Olivio et al. (2013), working on a different set of GBR corals, showed an increase in coral calcification rates on middle and outer shelf reefs, which together represent 99% of GBR corals, of 10% for the period ~1950 to ~2005, but a decrease of 5% per decade between 1930 and 2008 on inner-shelf reefs, which represent only 1% of GBR corals. Therefore, it would be hard to glean from these datasets that there is a documented decline in coral ‘growth’ parameters, and even harder to attribute the change to a particular cause.”",TECHNOLOGY,Fake

Sutherland, M.Ed./sciences  INTRODUCTION:  The reason our young people are shooting one another has a direct correlation to the fact that they are taught to do it.  Adults have refused to take responsibility for this travesty coming out of Hollywood movies, television, newspapers, organized religions, as well as the federalized Public School system.     QUOTE: We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false. – William Casey, CIA Director (from first staff meeting in 1981)  Find Out More >  60,013    FIRST:  I grew up in a home that did not have television until I was seven years old.  The day my father brought home the black-and-white Zenith television, so that he could watch the news in the morning, there began a long-term confrontation with my mother.  She refused to let us watch the “children shows”.  Why?  She said that the stories taught children how to disobey their parents, and that was wrong.  Her children would not be allowed to disobey.  Needless to say, my mother’s decision put her children outside of the circle of conversation within their peer group.  We could not talk about the adventures of Lassie or Flicka or Fury or Mighty Mouse or Disney movies.  We did not watch them.     SECOND:  Today, I am a grandmother with three adorable grandchildren.  I see the children about two times each year, because distance separates us.  In 2016 they came to visit.  I was sitting on the carport enjoying my four year old granddaughter play with her two year old brother.  While playing, my granddaughter said, “Brother, we choose evil, don’t we?”  To which he responded, “Yep.”  Instantly I said, “Oh no you don’t.  You choose to be good.  That is important.”  The stared at me with a blank expression, and then turned back to playing with the toys.  They have wonderful parents who strive to help the community and raise good children.  Unfortunately, the children are getting a serious message from demonic dung that spews from the demonic dynasties on earth.  The false teachings have already interrupted the family’s moral training…quietly and without warning.      THIRD:  I began to explore where the idea entered into my children’s minds.  I visited them in 2018.  It did not take long to find the demonic source.  My grandchildren are not allowed to watch television during the week.  On weekends they are allowed an indulgence.  On Saturday, my granddaughter chose a Disney videotape to watch and she insisted that her grandmother watch it with her.  In the video in big bold letters was a sign behind the dancers that stated: “We Choose Evil.”  The musical song, which my granddaughter can sing for memory, stated the same words.  I looked at the television and stated very clearly, “I do not like this movie.  It is evil.”  I walked out of the room.  My grandchildren were stunned.  They began to tell me, “No, Grana, this is a good movie.”  We had a very brief conversation, and I held my ground.     FOURTH:  In the 1960s there was a song entitled, “Where have all the flowers gone?”  The chorus asks, “When will they ever learn?”  That remains the question.  When will adults choose goodness?  If one takes any ancient religion, and reads the literature, it is obvious that ancient men recognized that there is a difference between good and evil. Even the atheist philosophers discussed it.  In the 1950s, unfortunately our nation was treated to a huge disinformation campaign concerning that choice.  The seminaries were filled with Human Secular professors.  They taught the young priests and pastors that “God is dead” and that the entire idea of God is a myth.  I remember in 1960, as a first grader attending Sunday school, there was a change.  No longer did we study the Bible, but we started studying the United Nations.  The mind-bending literature continued into my adult years.  We were brain-washed with false teachings, which were coming out of the mouths of our trusted adults like parents, teachers, and pastors.  If one questioned the facts, there was severe punishment.  One was branded as a trouble maker and banished from the discussion.  In 1986, a team of parents discovered the RAND institute and public education system created the Delphi Technique, which facilitated groups to obey the chosen path of thinking.  Yes, for decades our youth have been trained to obey FALSE DOCTRINE.     FIFTH:  In 2014, technology caught up with the ancient writings.  Today the quantum computers are communicating across dimensional divides with entities who give men answer to math questions.  In fact, the CERN project is On the Record that there is a Triune energy, which really does exist.  That is scientific knowledge. There is no mass.  Everything is pure energy.  CERN has found portals… doorways… through which a transfer of information can pass.  The LORD God is not a “belief system”.  He is a reality that can be documented via quantum physics.  The Adversary of mankind is also real, and he is documented.

They infiltrated the school system first, because they knew that in order to stop the ideas that breed freedom, they would have to change an entire generation of children.  That is state on the record by the men who invented the American public school system.  There is no doubt about the intentions of those men.  Of course, this information is not taught to young teachers.  It is only taught during a Master’s degree of education.  By then, the teacher is so deeply entrenched in the education system, and usually in deep debt for the education, that they just go along with the program, because it pays them a check.

College students inside the night club were gunned down by a young man who was a former United States soldier.  Once again the mantra is building for the Gun Control advocates.  Of course, the demon-led advocates totally ignore the fact that Chicago has the tightest gun control laws, but remains the highest on the list for homicides by gun.  They ignore the fact that Britain used gun control long ago, but it has not stopped knifing murders. They also ignore the fact that two cities in the USA passed laws forcing every adult to carry a gun, which stopped all homicides.  Data means nothing to those who promote a lie.

Global Fertility Rates Cut In Half Since 1950 ,"Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make. The death rate will increase until at least 100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years. —Paul Ehrlich, April 1970  The world’s total fertility rate has been cut in half since 1950, but the population is still rising, according to a study published Thursday in The Lancet. The total fertility rate — or the average number of children a woman would have if she lived through all her reproductive years — declined from 4.7 live births in 1950 to 2.4 in 2017. —Michael Nedelman, CNN, 9 November 2018   There has been a remarkable global decline in the number of children women are having, say researchers. Their report found fertility rate falls meant nearly half of countries were now facing a “baby bust” – meaning there are insufficient children to maintain their population size. The researchers said the findings were a “huge surprise”. And there would be profound consequences for societies with “more grandparents than grandchildren”. –James Gallagher, BBC News, 9 November 2018  Population Bombed: Exploding the link Between Overpopulation and Climate Change is an extensively researched, well-written and concise new book published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation. The book comes out exactly 50 years after Paul R.

"Ancient Comet Sightings Inspired, Frightened, Dazzled, and Baffled Past Astronomers and Star Gazers ","A foreboding comet crossing the sky. Ancient comet sightings were often linked to important, and sometimes frightening, events in the minds of those who witnessed them. Source: CC0  Since the earliest days of humankind, our ancestors looked into the night sky and watched bright celestial spectacles we know today as comets. While modern astronomers have a rich understanding of the phenomenon, ancient comet sightings were thought of as heavenly messages and were often feared as omens of ill fortune.  Chaldean Astronomers Sight Comets The European Space Agency website informs that the first systematic observations of the sky can be credited to the Chaldeans, who lived in the region of ancient Babylon, or modern day Iraq, around the third millennium BC. Clay tablets with explicit references to comets date from the last few centuries BC, but indirect sources, for example, the Roman philosopher Seneca, report that Chaldean astronomers had a keen interest in comets for a very long time.

Chinese records of comets exist at least as far back as 613 BC, and historians believe records had been kept for many centuries before then. Ancient Chinese astronomical data accuracy is unsurpassed and was not overtaken by Western accuracy until the 15th century. This is demonstrated, for example, with Halley’s comet, which appears in the sky every 70 to 75 years and was painted by Chinese astronomers from about 3000 years ago.    Detail of astrology manuscript, ink on silk, 2nd century BC, Han dynasty, unearthed from Mawangdui tomb. The page gives descriptions and illustrations of seven comets, from a total of 29 found in the document. (Public Domain )  In ancient Egypt, Pharaonic astronomical texts dating back to the ninth Egyptian dynasty (c. 2150 BC) name 36 stars which rise within 10 days of each other at the same time as the sun. Astronomers under Thutmosis III (1504-1450 BC) also recorded the apparition of what was later named Halley’s comet.  Comets in the Middle Ages By the Middle Ages, fear of comets had reached astronomical proportions and they were believed to portend natural disasters like floods and earthquakes. These so-called “tailed stars” appeared in famous works of art, such as the fresco Adoration of the Magi , by Renaissance painter Giotto di Bondone in the Cappella degli Scrovegni in Padua around 1304 AD. This image gave rise to the widespread belief that the Biblical Star of Bethlehem was actually a comet.  Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More...

(Public Domain)  Original Title:  Adorazione dei Magi,  c.1304 – c.1306, Fresco. Series: Scenes from the Life of Christ. Scrovegni (Arena) Chapel, Padua, Italy. ( Public Domain )  A 15th century poem provides historians with an impressive insight into the Medieval beliefs in the supernatural nature of comets: “They bring fever, illness, pestilence and death, difficult times, shortages and times of great famine.”  In 1540 AD, Peter Bienewitz (1495-1552) was the first astronomer of modern times to make the observation that comets’ tails always pointed away from the sun. He wrote about this in his book  Astronomicum Caesareum. Three decades later, the famous Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) measured the parallax of a comet which appeared in 1577 AD to be around 230 Earth radii, corresponding to 1.5 million kilometers. This measurement refuted the teachings of Aristotle, who believed comets to be phenomena generated “within” the terrestrial atmosphere, and Brahe proved that comets were independent celestial bodies.

( Public Domain )  A dispute emerged regarding the trajectory of comets and the cause of their trails, which was presented on the title page of Hevelius’  Cometographia, published in 1665 AD. On one hand, Tycho Brahe predicted that comets would return periodically, however, Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) believed they projected in straight lines. This argument was later settled by Danzig alderman and astronomer, Johannes Hevelius (1611-1687), who proposed that comets traveled in elongated parabolas and hyperbolas, as we now know they do.    Illustration of comet tail shapes featured in Johannes Hevelius’, ‘ Tavola N dell’opera Cometographia di Johannes Hevelius.’ ( Public Domain )  Halley’s Comet and Hale-Bopp When we were in junior school, there was only ever one comet talked about, famously named after the 24-year-old Edmond Halley (1656-1742) who in 1680 explained to his friend Isaac Newton that the comet probably had a “sharply curved” trajectory. In scholar Peter Lancaster Brown’s 1985 book Halley & His Comet we learn that with this primary observation, Halley entered a world of celestial dynamics and spherical geometry, and he calculated that the comets’ elongated ellipse should cause it to return in 1758. On the evening of December 25, 1758 the amateur astronomer Johann Georg Palitzsch (1723-1788) reported a weak spot of light in the Pisces constellation… The Halley’s comet returned just as predicted.  Hale-Bopp was the last bright comet seen from Earth. It appeared in the terrestrial sky in the spring of 1997. Since then, comet technology has advanced at such a rate that a mission to comet Wild 2 showed crater-covered “space potatoes” ejecting frozen material into space, which has remained almost unchanged since it originated 4.5 billion years ago.

(John Vermette/ CC BY SA 4.0 )  Modern Technology and the Study of Comets Journeying towards the sun, comet gases vaporize and form a thin extended atmosphere known as the coma. Flows of electrically charged particles called solar winds are generated by the sun and travel through space at a speed of 400 kilometers per second, which forms the comet’s tail – the archetypal aesthetic feature of a comet which can measure 100s of millions of kilometers.  Today, astronomers are performing acts of mechanical and engineering genius which were beyond the wildest dreams of even the brightest minds in ancient history. Comet ‘Tempel 1’ was photographed 67 seconds after it collided with Deep Impact by a high-resolution camera mounted on a spacecraft flying by the event. The following image reveals the comets ridges, scalloped edges and impact craters.  Comet ‘Tempel 1’ passed close to the Sun and warmed up, releasing gases in a process known to astronomers as outgassing, which produces a visible coma and sometimes a tail.

( Public Domain )  Space rubble around comets consists of very fine particles and larger rocks which solar winds blow off the surface a comet. When Earth passes through a field of this material, the particles penetrate the atmosphere and appear to race across the sky in a phenomena we call shooting stars. The largest pieces of space rubble that penetrate the terrestrial atmosphere fall to Earth as meteorites.  The Hoba West meteorite impact is thought to have occurred more recently than 80,000 years ago and this space rock is still located on a farm near Grootfontein, in the Otjozondjupa Region of Namibia. Its extreme mass means it has never been moved from the spot where it collided with the surface of Earth.

Ninth Circuit Pauses Kids’ Climate Suit to Hear Latest Government Appeal ,"The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals once again postponed the landmark constitutional climate case, Juliana v. United States, on Thursday, granting a motion by the Trump administration for a temporary stay of District Court proceedings.  Despite halting the trial while it considers the government’s latest appeal, the Ninth Circuit ordered trial preparations to continue.  In a separate conference later in the day, U.S. District Court Judge Ann Aiken said she will quickly get the case back on the court schedule if the stay is lifted.  “The Court told us to continue getting our work done for trial so that we are all ready when the Ninth Circuit rules. That’s exactly what we will do. And our briefs to the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit on mandamus will show that there is no basis to grant the Government’s request of an appeal before final judgment,” said Julia Olson, co-counsel for the 21 young plaintiffs.  The Ninth Circuit’s ruling came in response to a fourth petition for a writ of mandamus filed by the government on Monday.  Find Out More >  60,511 It is the latest in a continuing effort by the Trump administration to sidetrack the case, which was first filed in 2015. Thursday’s ruling grants a temporary stay until that petition can be considered.  The Ninth Circuit has already turned down three previous petitions for mandamus, a rarely used legal mechanism in which a higher court is asked to overrule a lower court before a trial or verdict.  The Ninth Circuit also said that the young plaintiffs and the District Court must file a response to the government’s petition within 15 days.  The government will then have five days to respond. The parties must also file a joint report on the status of discovery and any relevant pretrial issues within 15 days.  The young plaintiffs assert that the U.S. Government is depriving their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property by creating a national energy system based on climate-changing fossil fuels.  They are asking the federal government to implement a science-based plan to curb climate change.  “Given the urgency of climate change, we hope the Ninth Circuit will recognize the importance to these young Americans of having a prompt trial date,” said Philip Gregory, co-counsel for the plaintiffs.  “We will continue to move the case forward by completing discovery and responding to the various petitions filed by the Trump administration. We are pleased this stay is only temporary. We want to commence presenting climate science in court as soon as possible.”  ",TECHNOLOGY,Fake

Nearly 50 Oregon Gun Owners Have Their Firearms Seized by the State ,"Nearly 50 Oregon gun owners are the latest to fall victim to “extreme risk protection orders,” (ERPOs) otherwise known as “red flag gun confiscation laws.”  “At least 46 Oregonians have been ordered to surrender their guns under a new type of court order intended to stop suicides and mass shootings, law enforcement and court officials testified to state lawmakers [in September],” Oregonlive.com reported. “…Analysis showed judges ordered guns seized mostly from people affected by substance abuse, anger or mental health problems. Research presented to lawmakers indicates that trend has continued.”  Gunpowder Magazine has highlighted four scary facts gun owners should know about red flag laws:  1. Law-abiding gun owners are guilty until proven innocent under ERPOs. These bills open the floodgates for vindictive family members, friends, or John Q. Public to accuse you of almost anything as justification to take your firearms.  2. ERPOs open up a Pandora’s Box of ways for cunning lawyers and conniving family members to exploit gun owners. Red flag ERPO bills have been written so broadly on two fronts that in some instances, people are given near-endless possibilities by which to use the legal system to persecute gun owners.  3. The time frame for confiscation can go on for months. ERPOs can last for weeks, months, or up to a year in cases where a gun owner would have to appear for repeated court hearings to try to win back his or her Constitutional rights. In some instances, the government would hold onto your guns for you; other bills have a neutral third party holding onto your guns.  4. Both political parties are supporting ERPOs. Many would have you believe that Democrats are leading the charge for gun control in the wake of the horrific school shootings of 2018. But nothing could be further from the truth. Republicans are leading efforts as well.  ",POLITICS,Fake
"Video Shows NYPD Officer Punching, Tasing Handcuffed Disabled Man ","The NYPD Internal Affairs Division is investigating the violent arrest of a 24-year-old Staten Island man with severe medical issues, after an officer was caught on video repeatedly punching and using a taser on him while he was in handcuffs. The officer—since identified as Vincenzo Trabolse—was previously named in a lawsuit for allegedly assaulting a man with cerebral palsy.  Smart Preppers Shop Here!  The video, taken by a distraught family member and shared by the Legal Aid Society, shows officers responding to a call about a domestic disturbance at 24-year-old William Colon’s Port Richmond apartment on September 28th. After barging into the apartment, Officer Trabolse seizes Colon, who is 4-foot 8-inches tall and weighs 85-pounds, and tackles him onto a bed.  Trabolse proceeds to punch Colon in the ribs, as a family member pleads with the officer to take it easy because of Colon’s medical issues. Despite the relative’s warning that “if you tase him he will get hurt,” Trabolse pulls out a stun gun and zaps Colon until his body crumples onto the bed.    Find Out More >  25,935 According to the Legal Aid Society, Colon suffers from several health issues related to diabetes, including Mauriac syndrome, GERD, scoliosis, and asthma. Doctors determined that the taser caused Colon’s blood sugar levels to skyrocket, leading to a possible coma, lawyers said. He was hospitalized following the arrest, and Legal Aid says he was shackled to his bed for four days.  “Mr. Colon suffered a brutal attack at the hands of Officer Trabolse, which given our client’s medical condition, could have been fatal for him,” said Legal Aid Society spokesperson Redmond Haskins. “After the chokehold death of Eric Garner, we’re appalled to see that there are officers still on Staten Island that employ this degree of brute force at first impulse. New Yorkers deserve better from the Department in these situations.”  Officers initially arrived at Colon’s home after a neighbor said that she heard arguing coming from inside the apartment. Lawyers say that there was some sort of dispute between Colon and his girlfriend, Lissette Torres, and she had to be escorted out of the house by his brother. Colon claims that he never touched Torres, who now says she was pressured by police to bring charges against her boyfriend.  “They kept trying to get me to write a statement. I said I didn’t want to press charges,” Torres told the Daily News. “They told me I was going to get locked up for vandalizing the house if I didn’t. I was frightened. I didn’t want to get arrested.

Colon’s lawyers also note that this is not the first time that Trabolse has been accused of using excessive force on a vulnerable person. A lawsuit filed in June alleges that Trabolse repeatedly punched Dante Daniels, who suffers from cerebral palsy, in the face, then forced his hands behind his back, causing him severe pain. Trabolse is also accused of arresting Daniels on false information that resulted in criminal charges of resisting arrest and governmental administration.  A spokesperson for the NYPD tells Gothamist that “the department is aware of the incident” involving Colon, and that an Internal Affairs investigation has been opened. On Wednesday night, City Councilmember Debi Rose called for a “transparent and swift review” of the “disturbing” arrest.

Trump calls on Chicago to embrace stop-and-frisk policing ,"Trump calls on Chicago to embrace stop-and-frisk policing method  ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump drew an enthusiastic response from a law-and-order crowd Monday, advocating the use of “stop and frisk” policing and saying he has directed the Justice Department to work with local officials in Chicago to stem violence in the nation’s third-largest city.  Find Out More >  25,930 “The crime spree is a terrible blight on that city,” he said at a convention of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.  Trump said he had ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to “immediately” go to Chicago “to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave.” He also encouraged the city to embrace the stop-and-frisk policing method, in which large numbers of people are temporarily detained, questioned and sometimes searched for drugs and weapons. It was used extensively in New York City until it was deemed unconstitutional because of its overwhelming impact on minority residents.  “Gotta be properly applied, but stop-and-frisk works,” said Trump, who had traveled to Orlando with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.  Chicago police said last week that there have been 102 fewer homicides and nearly 500 fewer shooting victims in the city this year, compared with the first nine months of 2017. The city of Chicago reached an agreement with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois in 2015 to curb stop-and-frisk procedures after the ACLU threatened to file a lawsuit over the issue. The ACLU said the police inordinately targeted blacks.  A spokesman for Mayor Rahm Emanuel blasted Trump for reviving criticism of the city’s homicide rate and the agreement with the ACLU.  “Even someone as clueless as Donald Trump has to know stop-and-frisk is simply not the solution to crime,” Matt McGrath said in an emailed statement.  The ACLU of Illinois’ Karen Sheley said Trump’s comments were neither accurate nor helpful. The Trump administration has consistently “encouraged strong-arm tactics and unconstitutional practices by police,” she said, adding, “The solutions to violence in Chicago are not going to come from Donald Trump.”  The White House and Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for more details on what Trump had asked Sessions to do.  Chicago’s violent crime has repeatedly drawn national attention — and Trump’s — as shootings and homicides climbed to levels not seen in nearly two decades. But the number of homicides has fallen — from 771 in 2016 to 650 in 2017, with a further decline expected this year. The number of slayings still exceeds numbers in Los Angeles and New York combined.  A report last year by former U.S. Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys to assess how Chicago was compiling with the agreement on stop-and-frisk noted a dramatic decrease in the number of stops since the ACLU lawsuit, but found that officers were still targeting racial minorities. The number of investigatory stops fell from more than 1.3 million in 2014 and 2015 to just over 54,000 in the first six months of 2016, the report said.  Emanuel, who recently announced he will not seek a third term, has clashed several times with Trump over the gun violence.  Soon after becoming president, Trump tweeted, “If Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on … I will send in the Feds!” Emanuel said he welcomed federal help but cautioned against the strictly “tough and rough” approach Trump seemed to advocate.  Trump’s comments came three days after a jury convicted white Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke of second-degree murder in the death of black teenager Laquan McDonald. Video showing Van Dyke shooting McDonald 16 times as he walked away from police carrying a knife stoked outrage nationwide and put the nation’s third-largest city at the center of the debate about police misconduct and use of force.  Trump, in his remarks Monday, singled out politicians who have criticized police, often in the wake of shootings of young, black men.  “Politicians who spread dangerous anti-police sentiment make life easier for criminals and more dangerous for law-abiding citizens,” he said.  Just weeks before the midterm elections, Trump accused Democrats of being soft on crime.  “The Democrats fight us at every turn. Whether it’s law enforcement or military. They fight us at every turn. And we win,” Trump said.  And he blamed “evil” people for nearly sinking his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation, saying, “It was a disgraceful situation.”  Trump said Kavanaugh would be “a faithful defender of the rule of law.”  Hours before Trump addressed the police chiefs, a handful of protesters outside the Orange County Convention Center waved signs reading “Sexual Predators Belong in Jail Not as President or Supreme Court” and “We Wish You Were Fake News.”  Trump also heralded recent declines in unemployment as a positive step toward lower crime rates. He said he was working hard on the opioid crisis and announced more than $42 million in new grant funding for innovative projects to fight the drug epidemic.  The money will fund more than 50 innovative projects through the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy’s High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program.  ",POLITICS,Fake
Blackboard Transact allows university police to track everything a student purchases and everywhere they go ,"CR80 News reports that Apple’s long-standing vision of tracking students smartphones has become a reality.  Earlier this month Apple kicked off its mobile student ID program at three college campuses, much to the delight of university police.  “Starting today on the campuses at the University of Alabama, Duke University and the University of Oklahoma, Blackboard with the aid of Apple is enabling students to use mobile credentials everywhere their plastic ID card was previously accepted.”  As far as I can tell, there are at least nine universities using iPhones and Apple Watches to track students. The other universities are Santa Clara, Bowling Green, Sacred Heart, South Carolina Independent, Fitchburg State and Purdue.    Purdue University’s Blackboard Transact program       Find Out More >  25,971 Apple’s spy on every student program is called “Blackboard Transact” which gives campus police an unprecedented view into students private lives. (Click here to learn more.)  Ironically, a Purdue student named Seth reveals what Blackboard Transact really is, an all-in-one tracking program that gives authorities “the keys to the castle” (approx. 1:15)  Blackboard uses a students biometrics to track everything they do at “college facilities, residence halls and all their payments for dining, laundry, vending and retail.”  University police can also use Blackboard’s Security Solutions and Automated Attendance Monitoring functions to track students in real-time.  Blackboard boasts that their biometric program “makes monitoring attendance as easy as possible.”  In the near future, university police can use Blackboard to limit a student’s access to buildings in real-time.  “These schools will leverage Blackboard’s NFC-compatible equipment on their campuses to facilitate a variety of transactions, including secure access to facilities such as residence halls, the dining hall, gym, library or campus events and for making payments at the bookstore, for laundry or off campus where student IDs are accepted. “  With Blackboard, free-speech zones and activism will become a thing of the past as universities will have unprecedented access to students lives and be able to momentarily lock doors.  Universities appear to be using Blackboard as a testing ground for total surveillance mobile devices. Because once students accept programs like Blackboard it will be much easier for DHS to convince them to accept mobile drivers licenses.  Mobile student ID’s and mobile drivers licenses are all about surveillance and profit (tracking your purchases). They can and will be used to create “trust scores” of everyone.  Sadly, this is just the beginning.  At least six more colleges are planning on using Blackboard.    Johns Hopkins University, Chapman University,  Northwest Florida State University, Texas A&M University–Corpus Christi, Bellevue University, Temple University     Blackboard plans on expanding to K-12 schools  Blackboard also has plans to use mobile devices to spy on K-12 schools across America.  Blackboard plans to use smartphones, mobile apps, and social media to send mass notifications to everyone in the community.  “Create your message once, and let Blackboard Mass Notification publish it across all your communication channels.”  Blackboard, because who doesn’t want to give police the keys to your kids “castle”?",POLITICS,Fake
Creating a Suspect Society: The Scary Side of the Technological Police State ,"By John W. Whitehead  /  The Rutherford Institute  John Whitehead  “If, as it seems, we are in the process of becoming a totalitarian society in which the state apparatus is all-powerful, the ethics most important for the survival of the true, free, human individual would be: cheat, lie, evade, fake it, be elsewhere, forge documents, build improved electronic gadgets in your garage that’ll outwit the gadgets used by the authorities.”—Philip K. Dick  It’s a given that Big Brother is always watching us.  Find Out More >  26,167 Unfortunately, thanks to the government’s ongoing efforts to build massive databases using emerging surveillance, DNA and biometrics technologies, Big Brother (and his corporate partners in crime) is getting even creepier and more invasive, intrusive and stalker-like.  Indeed, every dystopian sci-fi film (and horror film, for that matter) we’ve ever seen is suddenly converging into this present moment in a dangerous trifecta between science and technology, Big Business, and a government that wants to be all-seeing, all-knowing and all-powerful—but not without help from the citizenry.  On a daily basis, Americans are relinquishing (in many cases, voluntarily) the most intimate details of who we are—our biological makeup, our genetic blueprints, and our biometrics (facial characteristics and structure, fingerprints, iris scans, etc.)—in order to navigate an increasingly technologically-enabled world.  As journalist Anna Myers notes, “Fingerprint readers, eye scans, and voice recognition are no longer just the security methods of high-tech spy movies. Millions of mobile phone, bank, and investment customers now have these technologies at their fingertips. Schwab uses voice recognition, Apple uses fingerprints, Wells Fargo scans eyes, and other companies are developing heartbeat or grip technology to verify user identity. Whether biometric technology will thrive or meet its demise depends not only on the security of the technology, but also whether the U.S. legal system will adapt to provide the privacy protections necessary for consumers to use it and for companies to invest in its development. Currently there is no federal law and only one state with a law protecting biometric information.”  Translation: thus far, the courts have done little to preserve our rights in the face of technologies and government programs that have little respect for privacy or freedom.  Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... Consider all the ways we continue to be tracked, hunted, hounded, and stalked by the government and its dubious agents:  By tapping into your phone lines and cell phone communications, the government knows what you say.  By uploading all of your emails, opening your mail, and reading your Facebook posts and text messages, the government knows what you write.  By monitoring your movements with the use of license plate readers, surveillance cameras and other tracking devices, the government knows where you go.  By churning through all of the detritus of your life—what you read, where you go, what you say—the government can predict what you will do.  By mapping the synapses in your brain, scientists—and in turn, the government—will soon know what you remember.   By mapping your biometrics—your “face-print”—and storing the information in a massive, shared government database available to bureaucratic agencies, police and the military, the government’s goal is to use facial recognition software to identify you (and every other person in the country) and track your movements, wherever you go.  And by accessing your DNA, the government will soon know everything else about you that they don’t already know: your family chart, your ancestry, what you look like, your health history, your inclination to follow orders or chart your own course, etc.  Of course, none of these technologies are foolproof.  Nor are they immune from tampering, hacking or user bias.  Nevertheless, they have become a convenient tool in the hands of government agents to render null and void the Constitution’s requirements of privacy and its prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Consequently, no longer are we “innocent until proven guilty” in the face of DNA evidence that places us at the scene of a crime, behavior sensing technology that interprets our body temperature and facial tics as suspicious, and government surveillance devices that cross-check our biometrics, license plates and DNA against a growing database of unsolved crimes and potential criminals.  Increasingly, we are all guilty until proven innocent as the government’s questionable acquisition and use of biometrics and DNA to identify individuals and “solve” crimes makes clear.  Indeed, for years now, the FBI and Justice Department have conspired to acquire near-limitless power and control over biometric information collected on law-abiding individuals, millions of whom have never been accused of a crime.   Going far beyond the scope of those with criminal backgrounds, the FBI’s Next Generation Identification database (NGID), a billion dollar boondoggle that is aimed at dramatically expanding the government’s ID database from a fingerprint system to a vast data storehouse of iris scans, photos searchable with face recognition technology, palm prints, and measures of gait and voice recordings alongside records of fingerprints, scars, and tattoos.  Launched in 2008, the NGID is a massive biometric database that contains more than 100 million fingerprints and 45 million facial photos gathered from a variety of sources ranging from criminal suspects and convicts to daycare workers and visa applicants, including millions of people who have never committed or even been accused of a crime.  In other words, innocent American citizens are now automatically placed in a suspect database.  For a long time, the government was required to at least observe some basic restrictions on when, where and how it could access someone’s biometrics and DNA and use it against them.   That is no longer the case.  The information is being amassed through a variety of routine procedures, with the police leading the way as prime collectors of biometrics for something as non-threatening as a simple moving violation. The nation’s courts are also doing their part to “build” the database, requiring biometric information as a precursor to more lenient sentences. And of course Corporate America has made it so easy to use one’s biometrics to access everything from bank accounts to cell phones.  We’ve made it so easy for the government to target, identify and track us—dead or alive.  It’s like shooting fish in a barrel.  For instance, in March 2018, Florida police showed up at a funeral home, asked to see the corpse of 30-year-old Linus F. Phillip, and attempted to use the dead man’s finger to unlock his cell phone using his biometric fingerprint. (It turns out, cops unlocking cell phones with dead people’s fingerprints is now relatively common.)  In 2016, the Department of Justice secured a warrant allowing police to enter a California residence and “force anyone inside to use their biometric information to open their mobile devices.”  Two years earlier, in 2014, a Virginia court “declared it legal to use criminal suspects’ fingerprints to open up smartphones.”  This doesn’t even touch on the many ways in which the government is using our DNA against us, the Constitution be damned.  In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the Maryland Court of Appeals’ ruling in Raynor v. Maryland, which essentially determined that individuals do not have a right to privacy when it comes to their DNA.  Although Glenn Raynor, a suspected rapist, willingly agreed to be questioned by police, he refused to provide them with a DNA sample.  No problem: Police simply swabbed the chair in which Raynor had been sitting and took what he refused to voluntarily provide. Raynor’s DNA was a match, and the suspect became a convict. In refusing to hear the case, the U.S. Supreme Court gave its tacit approval for government agents to collect shed DNA, likening it to a person’s fingerprints or the color of their hair, eyes or skin.  Whereas fingerprint technology created a watershed moment for police in their ability to “crack” a case, DNA technology is now being hailed by law enforcement agencies as the magic bullet in crime solving.   It’s what police like to refer to as a “modern fingerprint.”   However, unlike a fingerprint, a DNA print reveals everything about “who we are, where we come from, and who we will be.”",POLITICS,Fake
"Grandfather and Grandsons Detained by Officer, Kicked Out of Park for Drinking Kombucha Tea ","After visiting the grave of their deceased father and son, a Virginia grandpa and his grandchildren were kicked out of a park for drinking Kombucha.    kombucha    Chesapeake, VA — Sid Tatem was trying to enjoy a picnic at Chesapeake’s Northwest River Park last week, but an overzealous park ranger quickly ruined the family outing. The ranger approached Tatem and sons inquiring about what they were drinking. Turns out the trio was enjoying some of grandpa’s homemade Kombucha, a fermented tea that has been around for thousands of years. Ranger Michael Peters was informed by Tatem the mixture might have residual alcohol from its fermentation but it could hardly be considered an alcoholic beverage.  Kombucha is the fermented tea that is sold in nearly every store across the country and which has an alcohol content so low that children can purchase it legally.  Currently quite a health food rage, it’s loaded in probiotics, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory substances. In other words, it’s really good for you and your body.  Find Out More >  26,175 However, Peters detained the family, confiscated the Kombucha, forced them to pour it out and promptly kicked the innocent grandfather and his grandchildren out of the park. The three had made a day visiting Tatem’s father’s grave and decided to stop by the park and enjoy some food and family time. Tatem said:  I thought it was good, clean fun…And as far as I’m concerned, it is.  The grandfather described the encounter between he, his 8 and 14-year-old grandsons, and Peters.  He said real assertively, ‘What are you guys drinking today?’…He was very disturbed, convinced I was contributing the delinquency of my grandsons…Kombucha is not considered an alcoholic drink anywhere.  Grandpa’s right. Kombucha is sold to minors as if it were a soda and the alcohol content is somewhere between .5 and 2 percent, hardly enough to have any effect on anyone. It is similar to a “near beer” drink such as the marked brand of beer O’Douls which has .5 percent alcohol. Even in Texas, where weed is still illegal, minors can buy O’Douls and kmobucha.  Tatem described what happened after he attempted to reason with Peters.  I thought, this is a losing situation. I asked the officer what he wanted us to do. He said, ‘Dump the kombucha out, and leave the park.’ We did so in silence.  Predictably, Peters’ supervisors stood behind their agent of the state. City spokeswoman Elizabeth Vaughn, supported the ranger’s decision to confiscate property which didn’t belong to him, pour it out, and send the trio from whence they came. Vaughn stated:  The citizen offered up the information that the containers had home-brewed kombucha, and the fact it contained alcohol. Seeing it was given to juveniles, he was told to leave the park.  One could say Tatem got off pretty lucky. Had he resisted the confiscation, other men with guns could have been called and they could’ve been hurt. Had he chose not surrender his homemade Kombucha, he could have been tased, beaten, or possibly even killed. We’re not exaggerating folks. This happens all the time.  When citizens are determined to flex their rights, bad things can often happen. Tatem had a right not to be contacted by the Park Ranger. He also had a right not to speak with the ranger. He also had a right not to be searched and his property seized. Furthermore, the grandpa and his two grandsons had a right to be able to enjoy the park just like everyone else—without becoming subject to the American police state.",POLITICS,Fake

"WATCH: Cop Pulls Gun, Drags Woman from Car, Punches Her in the Face Over Suspended License ","An Arizona woman was punched and dragged from her vehicle all for having a suspended license, a ticketable offense. We’ve uncovered a flaw in the system which places police officers as well as unsuspecting members of the public at risk for harm.    license    Goodyear, AZ — More controversy created by law enforcement coming out of Arizona this week as a Goodyear police officer was caught on camera beating and dragging a woman out of her car on pavement which routinely reaches flesh melting temperatures. Her crime: having a suspended drivers license.  Unlike other states, Arizona has a flaw in its motor vehicle insurance tracking software. Inexplicably, as one resident told TFTP, a person’s insurance can appear to not be valid. The Arizona MDV system then notifies the resident their appears to be a lapse in their insurance coverage. If the notice goes overlooked, the resident’s drivers license can then be suspended.  The motorist will then be pulled over by police. If they cannot prove they have insurance, the car is towed and the motorist can be arrested for driving on a suspended license. Goodyear police did not say such is the case with the motorist in the following video but they did confirm she was driving on a suspended license.  Find Out More >  27,078 The Goodyear PD officer can be seen dragging the woman from her car. He punches her in the face, and then drags her down the hot pavement. The man in the car with the woman was told to get on the ground as the officer pointed his service pistol at him. He complied.  The woman’s daughter, Cassandra, told AZFamily reporters:  It was heartbreaking for me to see like, I just couldn’t believe it, that’s my mom. I didn’t know what he was going to do to her, she was scared for her life. It was really outrageous, it shouldn’t have went that far. It was ridiculous.  She believes the entire incident could have been handled differently. She said:  “I don’t know why they treat people like that, she’s human. She’s a woman, he’s a man,” Cassandra said. “They need to be able to nonviolently arrest people, they need more training. You shouldn’t do that to someone. We’re all humans.”  Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... Unfortunately, when it comes to the police state generating revenue for the county, all bets are off in regard to police officers treating citizens like humans. We at TFTP have confirmed with numerous individuals in Arizona that the AZ MDV system is flawed, whether unintentionally or intentionally, to drive up the issuance of citations, arrests, and court costs—all of which necessitates the contracting of lawyer services.  Whether or not Cassandra’s mom and her ordeal will be the catalyst for fixing the error is anyone’s guess.  Goodyear Police Department responded with the following statement:  On Thursday, September 6, 2018, at 1148 hours, a Goodyear officer conducted a motor vehicle stop near the northwest corner of Van Buren and Dysart. The driver who had a suspended driver’s license was notified that she was being placed under arrest; at that time she began to retreat.  When a conflict with a suspect occurs during an arrest, this presents a challenging and often dangerous situation for the arresting officer. The top priority of the Goodyear Police Department is the safety of the public as well as our officers. When a situation such as this occurs, it can appear frightening to passersby who don’t understand the full context of the situation. In the interest of transparency and maintaining the trust of our public, the Goodyear Police Department is currently investigating the specific details of this particular case. We are working to review body cam footage and conducting interviews to determine exactly what occurred. Once our investigation is complete and all the facts are in, we will be better able to provide accurate information as to the details of this arrest. We appreciate your patience as we conduct our thorough investigation.  We at TFTP believe we’ve identified at least one error in the legal system. Because insurance gaps appear on AZ MDV programming, innocent people with insurance are being pulled over, threatened with having their car towed, and being arrested, all for paying their insurance premiums on time in a failed bureaucratic police state.",POLITICS,Fake

In testimony to HUAC in 1953, she revealed some Liberals “have allowed themselves to become supporters of the very members of this conspiracy. This is not liberalism, not liberalism in the finest sense of the word. This is just allowing the Communist to pull them into a propaganda environment which says that “anyone who is close to the Communist is a liberal.

The Protocols of Zion make it clear that the Illuminati bankers promoted liberalism and equality only to overthrow the gentile aristocracy and church. “While preaching liberalism to the goy we at the same time keep our own people and our agents in a state of unquestioning submission.” (15)  “In order to annihilate the institutions of the goyim … we have replaced [their mechanism] by the chaotic license of liberalism. We have got our hands into the administration of the law, into the conduct of elections, into the press, into liberty of the person, but principally into education and training as being the cornerstones of a free existence.” (9)  Their control is based on the paralysis they induce in representative government. “We replaced the ruler with a caricature of a government–by a President taken from the mob, from the midst of our puppet creatures or slaves. This was the foundation of the mine which we have laid under the GOY peoples…” (10)  Harry-Waton-Quote-1.jpgThrough their control of the press and education, they lionized “sedition-mongers” which in turn has protected them. “This advertisement has increased the contingent of liberals and has brought thousands of GOYIM into the ranks of our livestock cattle.” (19)  As for equality, the founders of Communism write:” Far back in ancient times we were the first to cry among the masses of the people the words “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,” …” baits” [which] carried away the well-being of the world, true freedom of the individual, formerly so well guarded against the pressure of the mob.”  “The would-be wise men of the goyim, the intellectuals…did not see that in nature there is no equality, there cannot be freedom: that Nature herself has established inequality of minds, of characters, and capacities,… it was based upon these things that dynastic rule rested: the father passed on to the son a knowledge of the course of political affairs in such wise that none should know it but members of the dynasty and none could betray it to the governed. As time went on, the meaning of the dynastic transference of the true position of affairs in the political was lost, and this aided the success of our cause.” (1-25)   CONCLUSION  As well as controlling society, the Rothschild banking syndicate uses the Left to extort and undermine the competition. During the French Revolution, the Rothschild mansion was spared by the rioting masses. The Bolsheviks were instructed to appropriate Russian factories and hand them over to the bankers.  We are all liberals in the classical sense of believing in individual freedom. But the Illuminati bankers have changed the definition of liberal to the spurious notion of championing the underdog. This has been used to divert, divide and undermine the majority, and subject the individual to the collective will which they define.  20150716_socialism.jpgUntil liberals wake up to what the Protocols refer to as “the true nature of things,” they will continue to embrace their own destruction and that of Western civilization.

California Will Be the First State to Eliminate Bail Before a Trial After Governor Signs a New Reform Act ,"Governor Jerry Brown signed the California Money Bail Reform Act on Tuesday The bill, which takes effect on October 1, 2019, will eliminate bail before trial  It will replace bail with a risk-assessment system which determines if a suspect poses a risk to the public of may not show up for their court date Brown said the bill ‘reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly’ California’s governor Jerry Brown signed a bill on Tuesday which will eliminate bail for suspects awaiting trial – making it the first state to enact such a law.    The California Money Bail Reform Act will replace bail with a risk-assessment system, which will determine a defendant’s risk to public safety and probability of that suspect missing a court date rather than their ability to pay bail.   Brown said in a statement that the bill ‘preserves the rights of the accused, while prioritizing public safety’.  ‘Today, California reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly,’ Brown said.

Pictured are inmates outside at San Quentin State Prison in San Quentin in August 2016  Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye called the bill signing a ‘transformative day in our jusice system’.   ‘Our old system of money bail was outdated, unsafe, and unfair. It took a three-branch solution with Governor Brown, the Legislature led by Senator Hertzberg and Assemblymember Bonta, and the Judicial Council’s Administrative Director Martin Hoshino working with judges in my Pretrial Detention Reform Work Group to bring about a fair and just solution for all Californians,’ Cantil-Sakauye said.     Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... Brown’s signature gives the state’s Judicial Council broad authority to reshape pretrial detention policies.  Each county will use the council’s framework as a basis to set its own procedures for deciding whom to release before trial, potentially creating a patchwork system based on where a suspect lives.  Most suspects arrested for nonviolent misdemeanors will be released within 12 hours of being booked under the new law. Those facing serious, violent felonies will not be eligible for pretrial release.  The legislation gives officials 24 hours to determine whether other suspects should be released before trial. That time can be extended by 12 hours if necessary.  Some criminal justice reform advocates worry defendants will spend weeks in jail while their lawyers try to prove they deserve to be set free.    Brown said the bill ‘reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly’ Opponents of the legislation say it gives judges too much power. Some worry dangerous people will go free and won’t return for trial.  Supporters, including the Judicial Council headed by the state Supreme Court’s chief justice, say the change will end the unfair practice of imprisoning people simply because they are poor. Incarceration should instead depend on the risk a defendant poses if they are released, they argue.  ‘Wealth is not the measure of any woman or man. By eliminating cash bail, we are saying that those with the least ability to pay should not be released or incarcerated solely on the basis of their wealth or poverty. SB 10 is only one leg of the long journey toward perfecting our justice system, but it is an important one,’ said Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.   Other states such as New Jersey and New Mexico have overhauled their bail systems, although neither state has completely eliminated bail.  The Judicial Council is the policy-making body for California’s courts. It creates rules and procedures to ensure consistency across the state.  The California bill will take effect on October 1, 2019.   ",POLITICS,Fake
Vigilantes with a Badge: Warrior Cops Endanger Our Lives and Freedoms ,"There are always risks in challenging excessive police power, but the risks of not challenging it are more dangerous, even fatal.”—Hunter S.

So when I say that warrior cops—hyped up on their own authority and the power of the badge—have not made America any safer or freer, I am not disrespecting any of the fine, decent, lawful police officers who take seriously their oath of office to serve and protect their fellow citizens, uphold the Constitution, and maintain the peace.  Find Out More >  27,498 My beef is with the growing squads of warrior cops who have been given the green light to kill, shoot, taser, abuse and steal from American citizens in the so-called name of law and order.   These cops are little more than vigilantes with a badge.  Indeed, it is increasingly evident that militarized police armed with weapons of war who are allowed to operate above the law and break the laws with impunity have not made America any safer or freer.  Don’t take my word for it.  A new study by a political scientist at Princeton University concludes that militarizing police and SWAT teams “provide no detectable benefits in terms of officer safety or violent crime reduction.”  In fact, according to researcher Jonathan Mummolo, if police in America are feeling less safe, it’s because the process of transforming them into extensions of the military makes them less safe, less popular and less trust-worthy.  The study, the first systematic analysis on the use and consequences of militarized force, reveals that “police militarization neither reduces rates of violent crime nor changes the number of officers assaulted or killed.”  In other words, warrior cops aren’t making us or themselves any safer.  Consider that not a day goes by without reports of police officers overstepping the bounds of the Constitution and brutalizing, terrorizing and killing the citizenry. Indeed, the list of incidents in which unaccountable police abuse their power, betray their oath of office and leave taxpayers bruised, broken and/or killed grows longer and more tragic by the day.  Americans are now eight times more likely to die in a police confrontation than they are to be killed by a terrorist.  The problem, as one reporter rightly concluded, is “not that life has gotten that much more dangerous, it’s that authorities have chosen to respond to even innocent situations as if they were in a warzone.”  This battlefield mindset has gone hand in hand with the rise of militarized SWAT (“special weapons and tactics”) teams.  Frequently justified as vital tools necessary to combat terrorism and deal with rare but extremely dangerous criminal situations, such as those involving hostages, SWAT teams—which first appeared on the scene in California in the 1960s—have now become intrinsic parts of local law enforcement operations, thanks in large part to substantial federal assistance and the Pentagon’s military surplus recycling program, which allows the transfer of military equipment, weapons and training to local police for free or at sharp discounts.  Ponder this: In 1980, there were roughly 3,000 SWAT team-style raids in the US.  Incredibly, that number has since grown to more than 80,000 SWAT team raids per year.  There are few communities without a SWAT team today.  Where this becomes a problem of life and death for Americans is when these SWAT teams dressed, armed and trained in military tactics are assigned to carry out routine law enforcement tasks, such as serving a search warrant.  No longer reserved exclusively for deadly situations, SWAT teams are now increasingly being deployed for relatively routine police matters, with some SWAT teams being sent out as much as five times a day. In the state of Maryland alone, 92 percent of 8200 SWAT missions were used to execute search or arrest warrants.  For example, police in both Baltimore and Dallas have used SWAT teams to bust up poker games.  A Connecticut SWAT team swarmed a bar suspected of serving alcohol to underage individuals.  In Arizona, a SWAT team was used to break up an alleged cockfighting ring.  An Atlanta SWAT team raided a music studio, allegedly out of a concern that it might have been involved in illegal music piracy.  A Minnesota SWAT team raided the wrong house in the middle of the night, handcuffed the three young children, held the mother on the floor at gunpoint, shot the family dog, and then “forced the handcuffed children to sit next to the carcass of their dead pet and bloody pet for more than an hour” while they searched the home.  A California SWAT team drove an armored Lenco Bearcat into Roger Serrato’s yard, surrounded his home with paramilitary troops wearing face masks, threw a fire-starting flashbang grenade into the house in order, then when Serrato appeared at a window, unarmed and wearing only his shorts, held him at bay with rifles. Serrato died of asphyxiation from being trapped in the flame-filled house. Incredibly, the father of four had done nothing wrong. The SWAT team had misidentified him as someone involved in a shooting.  And then there was the police officer who tripped and “accidentally” shot and killed Eurie Stamps, an unarmed grandfather of 12, who had been forced to lie facedown on the floor of his home at gunpoint while a SWAT team attempted to execute a search warrant against his stepson.  Equally outrageous was the four-hour SWAT team raid on a California high school, where students were locked down in classrooms, forced to urinate in overturned desks and generally terrorized by heavily armed, masked gunmen searching for possible weapons that were never found.  These incidents are just the tip of the iceberg.  Nationwide, SWAT teams have been employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances: angry dogs, domestic disputes, improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer, and misdemeanor marijuana possession, to give a brief sampling.  If these raids are becoming increasingly common and widespread, you can chalk it up to the “make-work” philosophy, in which you assign at-times unnecessary jobs to individuals to keep them busy or employed. In this case, however, the make-work principle is being used to justify the use of sophisticated military equipment and, in the process, qualify for federal funding.  Remember, SWAT teams originated as specialized units dedicated to defusing extremely sensitive, dangerous situations. They were never meant to be used for routine police work such as serving a warrant.  As the role of paramilitary forces has expanded, however, to include involvement in nondescript police work targeting nonviolent suspects, the mere presence of SWAT units has actually injected a level of danger and violence into police-citizen interactions that was not present as long as these interactions were handled by traditional civilian officers.   What we are witnessing is an inversion of the police-civilian relationship.  Rather than compelling police officers to remain within constitutional bounds as servants of the people, ordinary Americans are being placed at the mercy of militarized police units.   This is what happens when paramilitary forces are used to conduct ordinary policing operations, such as executing warrants on nonviolent defendants.  Moreover, general incompetence, collateral damage (fatalities, property damage, etc.) and botched raids tend to go hand in hand with an overuse of paramilitary forces.  In some cases, officers misread the address on the warrant.  In others, they simply barge into the wrong house or even the wrong building.

In another subset of cases (such as the Department of Education raid on Anthony Wright’s home), police conduct a search of a building where the suspect no longer resides.   SWAT teams have even on occasion conducted multiple, sequential raids on wrong addresses or executed search warrants despite the fact that the suspect is already in police custody. Police have also raided homes on the basis of mistaking the presence or scent of legal substances for drugs. Incredibly, these substances have included tomatoes, sunflowers, fish, elderberry bushes, kenaf plants, hibiscus, and ragweed.   As you can see, all too often, botched SWAT team raids have resulted in one tragedy after another for the residents with little consequences for law enforcement.   Unfortunately, judges tend to afford extreme levels of deference to police officers who have mistakenly killed innocent civilians but do not afford similar leniency to civilians who have injured police officers in acts of self-defense.    Even homeowners who mistake officers for robbers can be sentenced for assault or murder if they take defensive actions resulting in harm to police.   And as journalist Radley Balko shows in his in-depth study of police militarization, the shock-and-awe tactics utilized by many SWAT teams only increases the likelihood that someone will get hurt.    Drug warrants, for instance, are typically served by paramilitary units late at night or shortly before dawn. Unfortunately, to the unsuspecting homeowner—especially in cases involving mistaken identities or wrong addresses—a raid can appear to be nothing less than a violent home invasion, with armed intruders crashing through their door. The natural reaction would be to engage in self-defense. Yet such a defensive reaction on the part of a homeowner, particularly a gun owner, will spur officers to employ lethal force.   That’s exactly what happened to Jose Guerena, the young ex-Marine who was killed after a SWAT team kicked open the door of his Arizona home during a drug raid and opened fire. According to news reports, Guerena, 26 years old and the father of two young children, grabbed a gun in response to the forced invasion but never fired. In fact, the safety was still on his gun when he was killed. Police officers were not as restrained. The young Iraqi war veteran was allegedly fired upon 71 times. Guerena had no prior criminal record, and the police found nothing illegal in his home.   The problems inherent in these situations are further compounded by the fact that SWAT teams are granted “no-knock” warrants at high rates such that the warrants themselves are rendered practically meaningless.    This sorry state of affairs is made even worse by U.S. Supreme Court rulings that have essentiallydone away with the need for a “no-knock” warrant altogether, giving the police authority to disregard the protections afforded American citizens by the Fourth Amendment.   In the process, Americans are rendered altogether helpless and terror-stricken as a result of these confrontations with the police.   Indeed, “terrorizing” is a mild term to describe the effect on those who survive such vigilante tactics. “It was terrible. It was the most frightening experience of my life. I thought it was a terrorist attack,” said 84-year-old Leona Goldberg, a victim of such a raid.    Yet this type of “terrorizing” activity is characteristic of the culture that we have created.   If ever there were a time to de-militarize and de-weaponize local police forces, it’s now.   While we are now grappling with a power-hungry police state at the federal level, the militarization of domestic American law enforcement is largely the result of the militarization of local police forces, which are increasingly militaristic in their uniforms, weaponry, language, training, and tactics and have come to rely on SWAT teams in matters that once could have been satisfactorily performed by traditional civilian officers.   Yet American police forces were never supposed to be a branch of the military, nor were they meant to be private security forces for the reigning political faction.   Instead, they were intended to be an aggregation of countless local police units, composed of citizens like you and me that exist for a sole purpose: to serve and protect the citizens of each and every American community.   As a result of the increasing militarization of the police in recent years, however, the police now not only look like the military—with their foreboding uniforms and phalanx of lethal weapons—but they function like them, as well.    Thus, no more do we have a civilian force of peace officers entrusted with serving and protecting the American people.  Instead, today’s militarized law enforcement officials have shifted their allegiance from the citizenry to the state, acting preemptively to ward off any possible challenges to the government’s power, unrestrained by the boundaries of the Fourth Amendment.   As journalist Herman Schwartz observed, “The Fourth Amendment was designed to stand between us and arbitrary governmental authority. For all practical purposes, that shield has been shattered, leaving our liberty and personal integrity subject to the whim of every cop on the beat, trooper on the highway and jail official.”   Armed police officers, the end product of the government—federal, local and state—and law enforcement agencies having merged, have become a “standing” or permanent army, composed of full-time professional soldiers who do not disband.    Yet these permanent armies are exactly what those who drafted the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights feared as tools used by despotic governments to wage war against its citizens.   This phenomenon we are experiencing with the police is what philosopher Abraham Kaplan referred to as the law of the instrument, which essentially says that to a hammer, everything looks like a nail.    In the scenario that has been playing out in recent years, we the citizenry have become the nails to be hammered by the government’s henchmen, a.k.a. its guns for hire, a.k.a. its standing army, a.k.a. the nation’s law enforcement agencies.   Yet the tension inherent in most civilian-police encounter these days can’t be blamed exclusively on law enforcement’s growing reliance on SWAT teams and donated military equipment.   It goes far deeper, to a transformation in the way police view themselves and their line of duty.   Specifically, what we’re dealing with today is a skewed shoot-to-kill mindset in which police, trained to view themselves as warriors or soldiers in a war, whether against drugs, or terror, or crime, must “get” the bad guys—i.e., anyone who is a potential target—before the bad guys get them.   The result is a spike in the number of incidents in which police shoot first, and ask questions later.   Making matters worse, when these officers, who have long since ceased to be peace officers, violate their oaths by bullying, beating, tasering, shooting and killing their employers—the taxpayers to whom they owe their allegiance—they are rarely given more than a slap on the hands before resuming their patrols.   As I document in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, this lawlessness on the part of law enforcement, an unmistakable characteristic of a police state, is made possible in large part by police unions which routinely oppose civilian review boards and resist the placement of names and badge numbers on officer uniforms; police agencies that abide by the Blue Code of Silence, the quiet understanding among police that they should not implicate their colleagues for their crimes and misconduct; prosecutors who treat police offenses with greater leniency than civilian offenses; courts that sanction police wrongdoing in the name of security; and legislatures that enhance the power, reach and arsenal of the police, and a citizenry that fails to hold its government accountable to the rule of law.   Clearly, it’s time for a reality check, for both the police and the citizens of this nation.  ",POLITICS,Fake
New Report Details US Public Less Safe Under Militarized Police ,"A new study published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on August 20 reveals that the militarization of law enforcement in the United States does not make communities safer nor does it enhance officer safety. Study author Jonathan Mummolo conducted a statistical analysis on crime rates and officer safety data from Maryland, using an expired law — in effect between 2010-2014 — required that police agencies submit reports on how often they use SWAT teams.   A German Bundeswehr soldier of the 122th Infantry Battalion  SWAT (Special Weapons And Tactics) teams are intended to be used in emergency service and specifically for hostage, armed standoff and barricade situations in which heavily armed and armored troops assault an area after negotiations have broken down.  The study revealed that after controlling for variables such as local crime rates, a 10-percent increase in the black population resulted in a 10-percent increase in the chance of that zip code being “swatted” by an emergency service response team, but not routinely for the purpose for which they are intended.  Find Out More >  27,537 “Given the concentration of deployments in communities of color, where trust in law enforcement and government at large is already depressed, the routine use of militarized police tactics by local agencies threatens to increase the historic tensions between marginalized groups and the state with no detectable public safety benefit,” Mummolo wrote in his study.  “While SWAT teams arguably remain a necessary tool for violent emergency situations, restricting their use to those rare events may improve perceptions of police with little or no safety loss,” he noted.  The study found that an overwhelming 90 percent of SWAT deployments in Maryland over five fiscal years were conducted to simply serve search warrants.  In the study no evidence came to light proving that a SWAT team decreases crime or enhances officer safety, although the heavily militarized teams are often described as being integral tools to combat dangerous situations.  In addition, Mummola examined how the use of SWAT teams impacts the public perception of police. In two surveys, he showed volunteers stories about a police chief requesting a budget increase.   German Chancellor Angela Merkel with 'binoculars'  Volunteers received one out of four photos with the story. One photo showed a group of officers in traditional blue uniforms while the other three photos depicted heavy militarization gear.  “The control image featured five male, traditionally uniformed officers (e.g., blue uniforms, brimmed caps, and standard sidearms). The ‘low’ militarization conditions showed five male officers with ‘riot gear’ and batons or with body armor and assault rifles. The ‘high’ militarization condition added an armored vehicle,” according to the study.  Study results showed that people assumed that the locations where there were militarized cops had higher crime. Revealingly, observers were also less trusting of police in those places.  “The high militarization condition in the survey caused a statistically significant 2.2-point increase in the perceived level of crime in the vignette city and, strikingly, a 3.2-point drop in respondents’ desire for more police patrols in their own neighborhoods,” the study stated.",POLITICS,Fake
Battlefield America: The Ongoing War on the American People ,"By John W. Whitehead  /  The Rutherford Institute  August 21, 2018  John Whitehead  “A government which will turn its tanks upon its people, for any reason, is a government with a taste of blood and a thirst for power and must either be smartly rebuked, or blindly obeyed in deadly fear.”—John Salter  Find Out More >  27,615 Police in a small Georgia town tasered a 5-foot-2, 87-year-old woman who was using a kitchen knife to cut dandelions for use in a recipe. Police claim they had no choice but to taser the old woman, who does not speak English but was smiling at police to indicate she was friendly, because she failed to comply with orders to put down the knife.  Police in California are being sued for using excessive force against a deaf 76-year-old woman who was allegedly jaywalking and failed to halt when police yelled at her. According to the lawsuit, police searched the woman and her grocery bags. She was then slammed to the ground, had a foot or knee placed behind her neck or back, handcuffed, arrested and cited for jaywalking and resisting arrest.  In Alabama, police first tasered then shot and killed an unarmed man who refused to show his driver’s license after attempting to turn in a stray dog he’d found to the local dog shelter. The man’s girlfriend and their three children, all under the age of 10, witnessed the shooting.  In New York, Customs and Border Protection officers have come under fire for subjecting female travelers (including minors) to random body searches that include strip searches while menstruating, genital probing, and forced pelvic exams, X-rays and intravenous drugs at area hospitals.  At a California gas station, ICE agents surrounded a man who was taking his pregnant wife to the hospital to deliver their baby, demanding that he show identification. Having forgotten his documents at home in the rush to get to the hospital, the husband offered to go get them. Refusing to allow him to do so, ICE agents handcuffed and arrested the man for not having an ID with him, leaving his wife to find her way alone to the hospital. The father of five, including the newborn, has lived and worked in the U.S. for 12 years with his wife.  Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... These are not isolated incidents.  These cases are legion.  This is what a state of undeclared martial law looks like, when you can be arrested, tasered, shot, brutalized and in some cases killed merely for not complying with a government agent’s order or not complying fast enough.  This isn’t just happening in crime-ridden inner cities.  It’s happening all across the country.  America has been locked down.  This is what it’s like to be a citizen of the American police state.  This is what it’s like to be an enemy combatant in your own country.  This is what it feels like to be a conquered people.  This is what it feels like to be an occupied nation.  This is what it feels like to live in fear of armed men crashing through your door in the middle of the night, or to be accused of doing something you never even knew was a crime, or to be watched all the time, your movements tracked, your motives questioned.  This is what it feels like to have your homeland transformed into a battlefield.  Mind you, in a war zone, there are no police—only soldiers. Thus, there is no more Posse Comitatus prohibiting the government from using the military in a law enforcement capacity. Not when the local police have, for all intents and purposes, already become the military.  In a war zone, the soldiers shoot to kill, as American police have now been trained to do. Whether the perceived “threat” is armed or unarmed no longer matters when police are authorized to shoot first and ask questions later.  In a war zone, even the youngest members of the community learn at an early age to accept and fear the soldier in their midst. Thanks to funding from the government, more schools are hiring armed police officers—some equipped with semi-automatic AR-15 rifles—to “secure” their campuses.  In a war zone, you have no rights. When you are staring down the end of a police rifle, there can be no free speech. When you’re being held at bay by a militarized, weaponized mine-resistant tank, there can be no freedom of assembly. When you’re being surveilled with thermal imaging devices, facial recognition software and full-body scanners and the like, there can be no privacy. When you’re charged with disorderly conduct simply for daring to question or photograph or document the injustices you see, with the blessing of the courts no less, there can be no freedom to petition the government for a redress of grievances.  And when you’re a prisoner in your own town, unable to move freely, kept off the streets, issued a curfew at night, there can be no mistaking the prison walls closing in.  This is happening and will happen anywhere and everywhere else in this country where law enforcement officials are given carte blanche to do what they like, when they like, how they like, with immunity from their superiors, the legislatures, and the courts.  You see, what Americans have failed to comprehend, living as they do in a TV-induced, drug-like haze of fabricated realities, narcissistic denial, and partisan politics, is that we’ve not only brought the military equipment used in Iraq and Afghanistan home to be used against the American people.  We’ve also brought the very spirit of the war home.  “We the people” have now come full circle, from being held captive by the British police state to being held captive by the American police state.  In between, we have charted a course from revolutionaries fighting for our independence and a free people establishing a new nation to pioneers and explorers, braving the wilderness and expanding into new territories.   Where we went wrong, however, was in allowing ourselves to become enthralled with and then held hostage by a military empire in bondage to a corporate state (the very definition of fascism).   No longer does America hold the moral high ground as a champion of freedom and human rights. Instead, in the pursuit of profit, our overlords have transformed the American landscape into a battlefield, complete with military personnel, tactics and weaponry.  To our dismay, we now find ourselves scrambling for a foothold as our once rock-solid constitutional foundation crumbles beneath us. And no longer can we rely on the president, Congress, the courts, or the police to protect us from wrongdoing.   Indeed, the president, Congress, the courts, and the police have come to embody all that is wrong with America.  For instance, how does a man who is relatively healthy when taken into custody by police lapse into a coma and die while under their supervision?  What kind of twisted logic allows a police officer to use a police car to run down an American citizen and justifies it in the name of permissible deadly force?  And what country are we living in where the police can beat, shoot, choke, taser and tackle American citizens, all with the protection of the courts?  Certainly, the Constitution’s safeguards against police abuse means nothing when government agents can crash through your door, terrorize your children, shoot your dogs, and jail you on any number of trumped of charges, and you have little say in the matter. For instance, San Diego police, responding to a domestic disturbance call on a Sunday morning, showed up at the wrong address, only to shoot the homeowner’s 6-year-old service dog in the head.

WATCH: Unarmed Dad Murdered by Cops in Front of His Kids While Trying to Rescue a Stray Dog ,"For not having the proper driver’s license when he tried to bring a stray dog to a shelter, an innocent man was killed by police in front of his children.    license  Dothan, AL – A 30-year-old father, Robert Earl Lawrence was shot and killed by police in front of his own children, after he attempted to do a good deed by turning a stray dog in at a local animal shelter. The horrifying dash cam video showing this otherwise entirely innocent father’s execution has just been released.  On Dec. 30, 2014, Lawrence and his three young children—all under 10-years-old—found a stray dog in the parking lot of a Walmart in Dothan, Alabama. After they put the dog in their car, the family drove to the Dothan Animal Shelter to attempt to save its life.  However, instead of accepting this good deed and taking the animal in without question, the workers at the shelter demanded that Lawrence show them his government issued ID.  Find Out More >  27,689 Instead of giving them his ID, Lawrence showed them notarized and legal identification that was an affidavit instead of Motor Vehicle Administration ID card because he was a sovereign citizen. After being told that he couldn’t drop the dog without a state-issued driver’s license, Lawrence told the shelter that he would leave and bring the dog elsewhere.  However, the shelter told Lawrence that he couldn’t leave. The employees of the shelter, including an officer on the scene, then made a careless decision that would end the man’s life. It was not reported that Lawrence was at all belligerent or violent with the employees of the shelter, however, the police were present because he did not have a form of ID with which they were familiar.  As the dash cam shows, when police arrive, Lawrence was being polite and cordial and complying with the officer’s orders. However, it was the officer who grew belligerent and began making threats toward the father in front of his children.  As AL.com reports, a Dothan police officer stationed at the shelter followed him to his car and wouldn’t let him leave without producing a license. A couple months earlier, according to his cousin, Lawrence had begun to read about sovereign citizens, an anti-government movement that often includes, among other things, complicated arguments against the constitutionality of driver’s licenses. In short, Lawrence was ready to argue.  Having studied all the laws surrounding the sovereign citizen’s movement, Lawrence attempted to plead his case for not having to produce a driver’s license to the officer who wanted nothing of it.  Several minutes later, after multiple threats from the officer to Lawrence, the officer attempted to kidnap the man for trying to plead his case as to why he didn’t think he required a driver’s license.  Remember, Lawrence had caused harm to no one. He had not stolen anything, broken any laws, or otherwise done anything to warrant the presence of police. He and his children were simply trying to rescue a dog.  As police tried to take Lawrence into custody, a struggle ensued as Lawrence—knowing he had caused no harm and hurt no one—did not want to be kidnapped.  Moments later, as AL.com reports, Sgt. Adrianne Woodruff reached her arm through a melee, between the arms of two officers tugging at Lawrence, to press the barrel of her service weapon into in his gut and, without warning or utterance, pulled the trigger.  Lawrence was unarmed and was not hitting or otherwise attempting to harm the officers. He was simply defending himself by pulling away. At one point, as shown in the video, as the officer was using the taser like a cattle prod on the innocent father, Lawrence grabbed his hand and tried to pull it away.  This pulling away of the taser was used to justify Sgt. Woodruff in the murder of Lawrence as they claimed he was an armed threat. Woodruff never received so much as a slap on the wrist for killing Lawrence that day and has fought for immunity in a civil case.  Now, however, a judge disagreed that Woodruff is entitled to immunity and has ruled that a lawsuit can move forward.  “It is undisputed that Woodruff gave no warning before shooting Lawrence,” wrote the magistrate last month. “A jury could conclude that Lawrence did not pose a serious threat of harm to the officers to warrant the use of deadly force by Woodruff.”  For not having a driver’s license to rescue a dog, Robert Earl Lawrence would be killed by police. His children would watch with their own eyes as their father died in front of them at the hands of those they thought were there to protect them.  As the lawsuit moves forward, it is highly likely that the taxpayers will be held liable for Lawrence’s death. However, no amount of money will ever fix the PTSD and anguish his children suffer from every single day as a result of Woodruff pulling that trigger.",POLITICS,Fake
Assaulting Cops Is Now Considered A Hate Crime In Connecticut ,"A 20-year-old man in Connecticut has been charged with a hate crime for throwing a brick at a police squad car, which could set a precedent for how assaults on police are categorized.  Police say a white man, Devon Adams-Almstad, threw a brick through a police officer’s patrol car window and said he “hates white police officers.”  Adams-Almstad was arrested Monday night for the incident and charged with first-degree criminal mischief, assault on police, reckless endangerment, hate crime and breach of peace, according to the Hartford Courant.  The responding officer’s incident report says that Adams-Almstad stated that “he hates white police officers because they shoot black people and that he hates all of us.”  Find Out More >  27,770 The incident comes after a video surfaced last week of a Hartford police sergeant telling a group of trespassers that he is “trigger happy.” The sergeant, Stephen Barone, was suspended for the incident but it has caused brewing outrage and facts have emerged that he was suspended prior to the current situation for an incident in 2016.  “If anybody wants to fight or run, I’m a little trigger happy guys, I’m not gonna lie. And I get paid a ton of money in overtime, if I have to shoot somebody. So don’t do anything stupid,” Barone is heard telling the group on Heath Street Thursday night in a three-minute clip posted on Facebook Friday.  Barone, a 10-year veteran of the department, was among several officers suspended in an investigation into a 2016 car chase in which then Sgt. Sean Spell kicked a man while he was handcuffed. Barone was later promoted to sergeant.  Adams-Almstad did not mention the video, according to the incident report, but Police Chief David Rosado brought it up in his comments on the attack.  “I know members of our community are deeply distressed about the statements made in the video that was released last week, and as someone born and raised in Hartford, I share that sense of distress,” Rosado said.  As a department, we take great pride in the relationship of mutual respect we’ve worked to foster between the department and the community we serve,” he added. “Attacks on our officers are entirely and unequivocally wrong, counterproductive and themselves damaging to that relationship.”  The brick did not hit the officer in the car, but he was cut by flying glass from the window, according to officials. Police stated that he got lucky and the “brick narrowly missed Officer Carlo Faienza’s head.”  “Like many in our city, I am disappointed and angered by the video which was released last week, but anyone who thinks it’s OK to express that anger through violence is doing grievous damage to our community,” said Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin.  Rosado spoke about the video condemning the attack on an officer and the video by the sergeant threatening the teens.  “I know members of our community are deeply distressed about the statements made in the video that was released last week, and as someone born and raised in Hartford, I share that sense of distress,” Rosado said Tuesday afternoon. “As a department, we take great pride in the relationship of mutual respect we’ve worked to foster between the department and the community we serve.  “Attacks on our officers are entirely and unequivocally wrong, counterproductive and themselves damaging to that relationship,” he added. “We should both continue to have a dialogue about the challenges we face and reject any violence directed at our officers because they are there to serve, even in the most dangerous and difficult times.”  The ACLU of Connecticut echoed statements by others that the actions by the officer were unacceptable.  “This video confirms that Hartford’s emphasis on ‘quality-of-life’ policing is not an investment in stronger communities, but in over-policing and under-protecting some city residents. As long as Hartford’s executive branch and police department continue to condone policing without checks and balances created by and for the people, this kind of unacceptable behavior will be a feature of the police department, not a bug,” said Executive Director David McGuire.  Apparently, it’s now a hate crime to assault a police officer, which I thought was a designation reserved for racial instances and not law enforcement dealing with dissident citizens after a video of a corrupt sergeant leaks threatening lives of citizens, but what do I know? The ACLU at the time of this report has not responded to the charge of a hate crime for throwing a brick at a police cruiser.  ",POLITICS,Fake
From Boston to Ferguson to Charlottesville: The Evolution of a Police State Lockdown ,"By John W. Whitehead  /  The Rutherford Institute  “It takes a remarkable force to keep nearly a million people quietly indoors for an entire day, home from work and school, from neighborhood errands and out-of-town travel. It takes a remarkable force to keep businesses closed and cars off the road, to keep playgrounds empty and porches unused across a densely populated place 125 square miles in size. This happened … not because armed officers went door-to-door, or imposed a curfew, or threatened martial law. All around the region, for 13 hours, people locked up their businesses and ‘sheltered in place’ out of a kind of collective will. The force that kept them there wasn’t external – there was virtually no active enforcement across the city of the governor’s plea that people stay indoors. Rather, the pressure was an internal one – expressed as concern, or helpfulness, or in some cases, fear – felt in thousands of individual homes.”—Journalist Emily Badger, “The Psychology of a Citywide Lockdown”  It has become way too easy to lockdown this nation.  Five years ago, the city of Boston was locked down while police carried out a military-style manhunt for suspects in the 2013 Boston Marathon explosion.   Find Out More >  28,015 Four years ago, the city of Ferguson, Missouri, was locked down, with government officials deploying a massive SWAT team, an armored personnel carrier, men in camouflage pointing heavy artillery at the crowd, smoke bombs and tear gas to quell citizen unrest over a police shooting of a young, unarmed black man.  Three years ago, the city of Baltimore was put under a military-enforced lockdown after civil unrest over police brutality erupted into rioting. More than 1,500 national guard troops were deployed while residents were ordered to stay inside their homes and put under a 10 pm curfew.  This year, it was my hometown of Charlottesville, Va., population 50,000, that was locked down while government officials declared a state of emergency and enacted heightened security measures tantamount to martial law, despite the absence of any publicized information about credible threats to public safety.  As Tess Owen reports for Vice:  One year after white supremacists paraded through the streets, the face of downtown Charlottesville was transformed once again – this time with checkpoints, military-style camps for National Guard, and state police on every corner.

More details from journalist Ned Oliver:  Downtown Charlottesville felt like the green zone of a war-torn city Saturday. More than a thousand local and state police officers barricaded 10 blocks of the city’s popular pedestrian district, the Downtown Mall, to prepare for the one-year anniversary of the white supremacist rally last year that left dozens injured and one dead. To enter, people had to submit to bag checks and searches at one of two checkpoints… Preparations aside, unlike last year, no white supremacist groups had said they were going to visit the city, and, by week’s end, none had. Instead, it was a normal day on the mall except for the heavy security, a military helicopter constantly circling overhead, and hundreds of police officers milling around.  Make no mistake, this was a militarized exercise in intimidation, and it worked only too well.  For the most part, the residents of this city—once home to Thomas Jefferson, the nation’s third president, author of the Declaration of Independence, and champion of the Bill of Rights—welcomed the city-wide lockdown, the invasion of their privacy, and the dismantling of every constitutional right intended to serve as a bulwark against government abuses.  Yet for those like myself who have studied emerging police states, the sight of any American city placed under martial law—its citizens essentially under house arrest (officials used the Orwellian phrase “shelter in place” in Boston to describe the mandatory lockdown), military-style helicopters equipped with thermal imaging devices buzzing the skies, tanks and armored vehicles on the streets, and snipers perched on rooftops, while thousands of black-garbed police swarmed the streets and SWAT teams carried out house-to-house searches—leaves us in a growing state of unease.  Watching the events of the lockdown unfold, I couldn’t help but think of Nazi Field Marshal Hermann Goering’s remarks during the Nuremberg trials. As Goering noted:  It is always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.  As the events in Charlottesville have made clear, it does indeed work the same in every country.  Whatever the threat to so-called security—whether it’s civil unrest, school shootings, or alleged acts of terrorism—government officials will capitalize on the nation’s heightened emotions, confusion and fear as a means of extending the reach of the police state.  These troubling developments are the outward manifestations of an inner, philosophical shift underway in how the government views not only the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, but “we the people,” as well.   What this reflects is a move away from a government bound by the rule of law to one that seeks total control through the imposition of its own self-serving laws on the populace.  Unfortunately, it doesn’t take much for the American people to march in lockstep with the government’s dictates, even if it means submitting to martial law, having their homes searched, and being stripped of one’s constitutional rights at a moment’s notice.  In Charlottesville, most of the community fell in line, except for one gun-toting, disabled, 71-year-old war veteran who was arrested for purchasing cans of Arizona iced tea, a can of bug spray and razor blades, all of which were on the City’s list of temporarily prohibited, potentially “dangerous” items. Incidentally, the veteran’s guns (not among the list of prohibited items) caused no alarm.   Talk about draconian.  This continual undermining of the rules that protect civil liberties will inevitably have far-reaching consequences on a populace that not only remains ignorant about their rights but is inclined to sacrifice their liberties for phantom promises of safety.   Be warned: these lockdowns are just a precursor to full-blown martial law.  The powers-that-be want us acclimated to the sights and sounds of a city-wide lockdown with tanks in the streets, military encampments in cities, Blackhawk helicopters and armed drones patrolling overhead.  They want us to accept the fact that in the American police state, we are all potentially guilty, all potential criminals, all suspects waiting to be accused of a crime.  They want us to be meek and submissive.  They want us to report on each other.  They want us to be grateful to the standing armies for their so-called protection.  They want us to self-censor our speech, self-limit our movements, and police ourselves.  As Glenn Greenwald notes in The Intercept:",POLITICS,Fake

Hartford Sergeant Shown On Video Saying He's 'Trigger Happy' Had Been Suspended In 2016 Abuse Incident ,"officials suspended Sgt. Stephen Barone Friday after a video surfaced that shows him telling suspected trespassers that he is “trigger happy.” “If anybody wants to fight or run, I’m a little trigger happy guys, I’m not gonna lie. And I get paid a ton of money in overtime, if I have to shoot somebody. So don’t do anything stupid,” Barone is heard telling the group on Heath Street Thursday night in a three-minute clip posted on Facebook Friday.  Barone, a 10-year veteran identified in the video by police officials Friday, was among several officers suspended in an investigation into a 2016 car chase in which then Sgt. Sean Spell kicked a man while he was handcuffed. Barone was later promoted to sergeant.    The video shows the suspects remained calm during the interaction, but one is heard describing the sergeant’s statement about being trigger happy as “spooky.”  “There’s four of you, one of me. Alright?,” Barone then told the group.  Find Out More >  28,666 It appears that during the conversation at least one other police car arrived at the scene.  Hartford police Assistant Chief Rafael Medina said in an email to community leaders that police are still reviewing the nature of the interaction Barone had with the group, but said he has been placed on leave and internal affairs has started an investigation.  “Regardless of the context or the intent, those statements are entirely unacceptable and represent a fundamental disregard for the conduct we expect and the standards we hold ourselves to,” Medina said. “We look at it from the perspective of the person on the other end of the field interview, and to hear those words isn’t just scary, it projects an image of law enforcement officers who take use of force lightly. As I hope you know, we do not take any use of force lightly as a Department.”  Stephen Barone  Sgt. Stephen Barone, second from left, was placed on leave after a video surfaced in which he was heard saying he was “trigger happy,” officials said.   One of the people said they were approached by the police at about 9:30 p.m. She said they were near an abandoned house that her boyfriend is considering buying, given it’s near to a store he runs.  The individual said they were all given a ticket for trespassing after they were searched by officers. She said no contraband was found.  Mayor Luke Bronin condemned the actions by the officer.  “The behavior in this video is completely unacceptable. It’s inconsistent with the values of our police department and our city, and it is deeply damaging and disappointing. Law enforcement officers have a responsibility to treat the use of force and threats of force seriously at all times,” Bronin said. Bronin does not plan to call for an independent investigation, but will rely on the findings of the department’s internal affairs division.  The president of the Hartford police union did not immediately return a call for comment.  During the video, the sergeant voiced concerns that the group was hanging out near a vacant home. He asked anyone if they had any weapons, drugs or any warrants.  He also asked the group for identification. When he asks the individual holding the camera, the video stops.  Barone was assigned in May as the ranking officer in the police department’s Community Response Unit, an initiative under the new chief that is tasked with engaging “in proactive problem resolution for quality of life issues that impact residents, visitors, and those who conduct business within the City.”  Medina said the department is reviewing the unit and its role following Barone’s suspension.  Hartford Cops Disciplined In West Hartford Arrest Probe Promoted  Barone, prior to his promotion to sergeant, was one of several officers disciplined for violating department standards during a police chase in June 2016 that turned physical when then-Sgt. Sean Spell kicked a man, Emilio Diaz, while he was handcuffed on the ground.  He was suspended for four days following a lengthy internal affairs investigation into what transpired that night. Investigators learned that at several times Barone “improperly” stopped the camera in his cruiser, including when he first tried to stop the car and when the chase ended on Flatbush Avenue in West Hartford.  During an interview, investigators said that Barone provided “excuses,” according to the expansive report. Barone, at one point, said it was muscle memory. He also said he manually shut the camera off follwing the chase and during the struggle with Diaz and Ricardo Perez, the two men in the car, because he didn’t think it was “relevant” to record the interaction.  He denied that he turned it off so it wouldn’t capture efforts to take the men into custody, the report read. Given that the camera was shut off, investigators from the state’s attorney’s office “were concerned that the video was physically tampered with” and had hard drives from the cruiser cameras sent for forensic testing.  Hartford Police Unit Formed To Crack Down On Quality Of Life Issues  Despite this, Barone, and a detective who was also involved, were both promoted to sergeant in September of last year. Police officials at the time said they had previously been passed up for promotions at the time because of this incident.  Hartford City Council President Glendowlyn Thames said she was disturbed and disappointed by what she saw on the video.  “It’s extremely troubling. Just based off the video, not knowing the full context, it’s very troubling to see one of our police officers interacting with our citizens in that way. It’s not acceptable behavior. It’s not the model we’re trying to build. As I understand it, the police department has taken swift action to put him on administrative leave,” she said.  She said the officer’s language was “unacceptable.”  In a scathing response to the video, the ACLU of Connecticut echoed statements by others that the actions were unacceptable, while calling into question the quality-of-life policing initiative.  “This video confirms that Hartford’s emphasis on ‘quality-of-life’ policing is not an investment in stronger communities, but in over-policing and under-protecting some city residents. As long as Hartford’s executive branch and police department continue to condone policing without checks and balances created by and for the people, this kind of unacceptable behavior will be a feature of the police department, not a bug,” said Executive Director David McGuire.

According to a criminal complaint, 33-year-old Tomas Medina was outside a car dealership at 438 West 206th Street around midnight on July 14th when Detective Fabio Nunez and Officer Shanee Pierce responded to a complaint of loud music.  “They told me the neighbors complained about the music,” Medina told the Daily News, which first reported the story. “I told him I was already picking everything up to go.”  Find Out More >  28,782 At around the 11:39 mark in the video below, which was provided by Medina’s attorneys at the Legal Aid Society, Detective Nunez approaches Medina from behind, grabs him by the neck, and pushes him into the side of a car.    As Medina appears to resist and protest his treatment, Detective Nunez appears to put Medina in a chokehold, which are explicitly prohibited by the NYPD patrol guide.  Later, the detective seems to draw his Taser gun, and shoot Medina, shocking him. The two exit the frame as bystanders gather and record the encounter, and uniformed NYPD officers swarm the scene.  “He just started choking me. I couldn’t breathe,” Medina told the News.

He also served in the @USNavy  3:46 PM – Nov 11, 2015  9 See NYPD 34th Precinct’s other Tweets Medina was charged with felony assault of an officer and resisting arrest. The criminal complaint against him alleges that Detective Nunez was “attempting to place [Medina] under arrest for disorderly conduct relating to playing music at an excessive volume,” and that Medina bit the Detective’s finger and hit Officer Pierce in the eye.  Court documents show that the City has paid out more than $250,000 in five separate settlements since 2005 related to Detective Nunez’s conduct; one case involved hitting a man with a baton, another involved a broken arm, another involved a home invasion.  The Manhattan DA’s office, which is prosecuting the case against Medina, sent a letter to Legal Aid attorneys this year stating that Detective Nunez may have lied under oath in 2009. That case involved Detective Nunez pulling over a livery cab and chasing and arresting its passenger for drug possession. According to the letter, Detective Nunez claimed that he had never spoken to the cab driver before the arrest occurred, and that he pulled the car over because it had its robbery light on. But the driver would testify that he never engaged his robbery light, and that Nunez pulled up to him earlier that evening to ask questions about his fare. The DA’s office declined to charge Nunez for lying.  Detective Nunez, who has been a police officer for 18 years, is currently listed as a “neighborhood coordination officer” for the 34th Precinct.  Medina’s arrest occurred one day after the NYPD decided to move forward with departmental charges against Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who was involved in the fatal choking of Staten Island man Eric Garner in 2014.  Cynthia Conti-Cook, a staff attorney with Legal Aid’s Criminal Special Litigation Unit, and one of Medina’s attorneys, told Gothamist that there have been at least 48 chokehold allegations against the NYPD in federal court since Garner’s death, costing the City more than a half a million dollars in settlements.  “Even though it rose to everyone’s attention in 2014 as a prohibited use of force, it still hasn’t stopped being used by officers, and it has been named in multiple allegations in lawsuits since,” Conti-Cook said.  She added that the fact that Detective Nunez is supposed to be part of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s community policing initiative “substantiates what we’ve been hearing from traditionally targeted communities about neighborhood policing.”  “It isn’t all basketball games and block parties. Many of the patterns of abusive policing still persist.”  View image on Twitter  View image on Twitter    NYPD 34th Precinct✔@NYPD34Pct  NCO’s Troppmann & Nuñez with our Mayor @BilldeBlasio & First Lady of NYC @Chirlane.

The NYPD’s shielding of disciplinary records means that the public does not know if Detective Nunez has been brought up on internal charges before (a search of a BuzzFeed News database of leaked records did not yield any results).  A spokesperson for Manhattan DA Cy Vance Jr. declined to comment because the case is still pending.  After Garner’s death, a 2015 report by the New York City Department of Investigation and the NYPD’s Inspector General’s Office found that the NYPD’s disciplinary process related to chokeholds yielded “inconsistent results,” and recommended that the department work more closely with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, and that officers undergo de-escalation retraining.  The NYPD responded to that report with a letter stating that eventually all 35,000 uniformed officers would receive the three-day training every year. Just last week, the CCRB released a memo flatly stating that if a chokehold is substantiated in a case, they would recommend disciplinary action.

"Where They Burn Books, They Will Soon Burn People ","Fact: President Trump is sitting in the White House, today, largely because of the Independent Media.  Find Out More >  28,858 Fact: President Trump just thumbed his nose to one of his biggest supporters, Alex Jones, when he refused to use the power of the President to reign in the illegal behaviors of the social media monopolies.  Fact: One-time staunch supporter of Trump, Gary Heavin, retired owner of curves, philanthropist and movie producer, stated on The Common Sense Show, that he no longer supports Trump and that he is clearly compromised. In the interview, I was shocked but I could not deny his supporting evidence. I desperately wanted Gary to be wrong! Sadly, everything he said was true.  Is It Time to Forsake Trump? Am I jumping off of the Trump train? No, I am not, I am being pushed of off the train by his explainable inaction in moving to protect the only media that has been friendly to the President.  There is no denying the many great economic accomplishments of the Trump administration. However, and for the time being, he has clearly deserted his base. This is my line in the sand for Donald Trump. If Trump does not move to undo the illegal censorship of the social media giants, it is time for the Independent Media to re-evaluate where we will place our efforts.  The  social media giants are low hanging fruit. They are in such blatant violation of Federal law, that prosecuting them is easy. Again, under the open forum laws that all social media giants claim membership status in, they are not allowed to discriminate and censor. Ted Cruz exposed the open forum umbrella that all the social media giants are operating under. Further, there is no question that the social media giants are monopolies. In fact, they are poster-children for this concept. However, monopolies cannot selectively censor without being in violation of anti-trust laws. Again, where is Trump?  Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... Where Will You Go For the Only True Version of the News? You are on this website, because you know you cannot trust CNN, ABC, MSNBC, the Washington Post, etc. By election day of 2018, you will not have many places to go to find out what’s really going on.  The following entities are actively censoring and banning the Independent Media:  The country of New Zealand for canceling the planned appearances of Lauren Southern Google which should now be considered the face of the New World Order Twitter Facebook Snap Chat Instagram All of the MSM, print, radio and TV. Patreon Any and every form of social media…. A man, who I suspect was an AI troll, sent me an email I want to share:  Hodges,  You and your kind are an absolute joke. You poor bastards in the alt right media deserve to go out of business. I am so happy that Alex Jones otherwise known as Bill Hicks is going out of business. Your sorry ass is next.   You are lucky that we don’t kill all of you and your families so you cannot reproduce your kind. Very soon you poor bastard you will have nowhere to go to spread your Christian BS. That will indeed be a good day when you are shipped off to a Fema camp……  I get emails like this all the time, but this one is important because it captures what many liberals are feeling in the present moment.  The Goal of Censorship As I previously said I used to be marginalized by being labeled a conspiracy theorist. After several decades of employing that strategy, it no longer works.  The globalists are attempting to permanently  silence the Independent Media once and for all. In the election of 2016, they made a mistake and it cost Hillary the election. They are determined that our influence on the upcoming mid-term elections is negated.  Heed my next words. The globalists have made another miscalculation. Even if every alt right media source was effectively censored the Blue Wave coming from the Democrats will fail. The damage has been done.  What’s Coming? The answer to that question is another question in response. Blue Dawn, Red Dawn and the destruction of America is on the table. There is no hiding the agenda of the globalists.  Many journalists are predicting widespread violence between now and the November election. Trump will be either a Hillary clone, at this point, or he will just fade away and become another New World Order puppet, or he can take some political Viagra and act accordingly.  Trump could still act, but I am not holding my breath. He needs us now in the midterm elections any by October many of us are going to be MIA. Donald Trump Jr. did talk about censorship yesterday, but he’s not his father.  What’s Next for the Media One must ask, if Trump continues to desert those that brought him to power, what lies next? Will the American people have anywhere to go to learn the truth about what is happening? The answer is yes, because nature hates a vacuum.  Unless Trump acts decisively, and soon, there will be significant changes. You will not see any of us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc.  The Independent Media (IM) will change form. The subscription model put forth by John B. Wells will very likely be repeated. With the revenues from YouTube, Facebook, etc., drying up, we will see the IM move to subscription services. At first the public, who are used to getting a free lunch (80%), will yell and scream at having to pay a subscription. However, after watching a week of CNN, they will return and pay a nominal subscription fee.  What you will see in the future, if this censorship trend continues, are nothing but websites and radio shows generated from those websites. However, the IM will have to be on a platform that they cannot be removed from such as GoDaddy. I have already positioned myself in this manner and my radio show is not hosted by anyone that can be pressured.  In the final analysis, we are witnessing the Great American Book Burning. Today’s libraries are housed on the Internet. The Alex Jones wing of the library was burned down in this latest purge. And what is that saying…..Where they burn books, they will soon burn people.We are no living under the American version of Maoism. What did Mao do to the Chinese people after the books were all burned and all information was controlled? He murdered 60 million of his own people.

Hungry 11 yo Girl Taken to Hospital After Cop Tasered Her in the Back for Stealing Food ,"After a cop suspected an 11-year-old girl of stealing food and she walked away, he tasered her in the back causing her to be taken to the hospital.    food  Cincinnati, OH — A disturbing story out of Cincinnati is making headlines this week after a police officer tasered an 11-year-old girl after he suspected her of stealing food. The officer who tasered the girl has been put on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. “Tasing someone…a child, for shoplifting? That’s ridiculous,” one witness told WLWT. “There is no reason for that.”  According to police, an off-duty officer working as a security officer at the Spring Grove Village Kroger confronted the girl after he suspected her of stealing food. When the officer attempted to stop the little girl, according to police, she did not listen to him.  The girl kept walking in an apparent attempt to get away from the officer who then pulled out his taser and shot her in the back.  Find Out More >  28,922 While being tasered, the girl was injured and was taken to a nearby children’s hospital where she was treated and released to her parents. According to police, the girl is charged with theft for stealing the food and obstruction of justice.  The officer involved was equipped with a body camera, however, according to police, he failed to turn it on during the incident. It was only turned on after the girl was tased.  Police also said they did not know if there was surveillance footage from the Kroger. However, they likely have it by now.  Although the officer was placed on administrative leave, police say the officer acted within the guidelines of their use of force regarding children.  As WLWT reported, Lt. Steve Saunders with CPD said their guidelines allow them to use a Taser on anyone 7 and older.  The department’s policy adds, “Officers should avoid using the Taser on obviously pregnant females and those individuals under the age of 7 or over the age of 70 due to the potential for these individuals to fall when incapacitated by a taser, unless the encounter rises to the level of a deadly force situation.”  Yes, you read that correctly. Police in Cincinnati can taser children as young as 7-year-old. They can apparently do so over the alleged theft of food as well.  “I would like to confer with the police officers to see why that policy is in place,” Coucilman Jeff Pastor said. “I’m not in the business of criticizing the policy, however a 7-year-old kid, being eligible for use of force by Taser, it probably shocks me, probably shocks most Cincinnatians.”  “We’re still waiting on bits and pieces of information but I can see no reason, I have a 12-year-old daughter, but I can see no reason why an 11-year-old child would be tasered given the circumstances for shoplifting,” Pastor said.  “We are extremely concerned when force is used by one of our officers on a child of this age,” Isaac said in a statement. “As a result we will be taking a very thorough review of our policies as it relates to using force on juveniles as well as the propriety of the officers actions.”  To be clear, stealing food is certainly wrong. However, it is one of those things that is easily forgiven as this girl was likely hungry. The cop could’ve used his discretion and allowed the girl to return the food. Or, he could’ve done like this cop in Myrtle Beach, SC, who was called to Hardees to arrest a homeless man in June. Instead of arresting him, however, he bought him dinner. ",POLITICS,Fake

New range of license-free ‘age appropriate’ images released to address ‘old age’ stigma One may be best known as Captain Jack Sparrow, the other the leader of the Avengers – but although both Johnny Depp and Robert Downey Jnr are in their mid-fifties, a majority of British daters think they are younger, highlighting a deeper dating age and image challenge in the UK.   With Wolverine and Greatest Showman movie superstar Hugh Jackman turning 50 on Friday (12/10) – the new research reveals Brits find it increasingly difficult to guess the age of people by looking at their photos. Lumen, the first ever app-only dating platform dedicated to the over-fifties, has revealed the trends and needs for this age group on the dating scene as it sets out its ‘anti-ageism’ mission to end the misperceptions associated with this group.   The app has found that over 41% find it very difficult to predict the age of someone by simply by looking at a photo of them with 21% often thinking everyday people are older than they are, which they blame on Hollywood using older actors to player younger characters.   To test this Lumen asked a panel of daters to guess the age of eight famous Hollywood actors.  Results show that the public is far from clear with over 60% thinking 55 year old Johnny Depp was under 50, 63% thinking 53 year old Robert Downey Jnr was under 50, and nearly half (46%) thinking 56 year old Tom Cruise was under 50. In fact, less than a quarter of the 1,300 people surveyed placed the celebs in their correct five-year age bracket.

Charly Lester, co-founder of Lumen said: “Our aim at Lumen is to shine a light on images and realities that truly reflect today’s over fifties, not just a Hollywood version of them.”  “It isn’t easy to age someone based on their picture, especially as the entertainment industry constantly uses older men to play younger roles.  Given Will Smith just turned 50 and Hugh Jackman will turn 50 this month, we were curious what UK daters thought their actual ages were.”   To reflect the reality of what it means to be over 50 today, Lumen has created a library of copyright-free images accurately capturing the vibrancy of this demographic, which it is calling on other brands to adopt.   Lumen thinks this is a deeper issue with current portrayals of over-fifties missing the mark, with stereotyped stock imagery and misleading language failing to capture the fun and adventure of being single and over 50. Just one in five (21%) of those aged 50 and upwards believe brands’ representations of their age group are accurate, according to research by YouGov.   Charly Lester, continued: “Of course those on our app are primarily concerned with the authenticity of images. To ensure everyone on the platform is genuine, we make every new user take a selfie when they join, which is cross-referenced against the photos they use in their profile. Everyone on the app must have at least three profile photos so people can see what they really look like.”  Technology is central to this process, and Lumen uses a specially created algorithm to assess the selfie image and authenticate against the other images provided as well as highlight likely age of the person.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

Mr. Damiano informs me that Steven Kramer (James Damiano’s lead attorney) had several boxes of songs delivered to Parcher & Hayes during the discovery phase of his case against Dylan.

Times was to simply change the words to existing melodies then credited his name to the entire song. Dylan even admitted that he wrote ‘Blowin’ in the Wind’ in 10 minutes by simply changing the words to the old spiritual song ‘No More Auction Block”  James Damiano’s movie “Eleven Years” cites by comparison Dylan’s complicity in these blatant thefts.   In 1982 Damiano auditioned for the legendary music producer John Hammond Sr. who was instrumental in signing  Dylan to Columbia Records.

The 13th Amendment Formally Outlawed Slavery and Was Ratified By the States in 1865   View this document on Scribd  The 13th Amendment was passed by the Senate on April 8, 1864. The House formally approved the measure in January of 1865. President Abraham Lincoln sent the proposal off to the states for approval. Three-fourths of the state need to approve an amendment to the constitution. It was ratified on December 6, 1865.  The 13th Amendment reads:  Section 1.  Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.  Section 2.  Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.  5. The 13th Amendment Allows for Prisons to Use Inmates as Laborers and It’s a Common Practice in the United States The criminal justice system allows for inmate labor. The 13th Amendment stated that convicted criminals can be forced to work. It does not stipulate whether inmates must be paid for their services.  According to the Prison Policy Initiative, inmates are paid on average about 86 cents per hour for non-industry prison jobs. Inmates may be put to work for state businesses or work for the prison itself. Newsweek reported that about half of the nation’s 2.3 million incarcerated people do some form of daily work.

Bill Cosby’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is vandalized — again ,"HOLLYWOOD — For the second time in four years, Bill Cosby’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been vandalized.  Someone spray-painted the words “Serial Rapist” across the star Monday night, said the Los Angeles Police Department, which is investigating the incident.  Cosby was found guilty in April of sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home in 2004. Although Constand’s allegations are the only ones that have resulted in criminal charges against the actor-comedian, dozen of other women also have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct.  Someone scrawled a similar message on Cosby’s star in 2014, CNN affiliate KTLA reported.    Find Out More >  94,386 For the second time in four years, Bill Cosby’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been vandalized.  Cosby’s star has been cleaned since the incident Monday, but his is not the only one to be targeted on the sidewalks of Hollywood. Here are a few more — including some that may surprise you.  Donald Trump In July a man smashed President Trump’s star to pieces with a pickax.  The former reality TV star’s star has been the target of repeated vandalism since Trump’s turn to politics. The beleaguered Trump star also has been covered in stickers, splattered with paint and had a tiny wall built around it.  A Superman impersonator told CNN in 2016 he once saw a visitor allow his dog to relieve himself on the star.  Michael Jackson This star actually honors a talk-radio host named Michael Jackson, not the late King of Pop, who has his own star with a symbol of a record. This star was spray-painted red in June, and it’s not clear whether the vandals knew the difference. Either way, the pop star’s daughter Paris Jackson shared a photo of herself scrubbing the star clean on Instagram, saying, “some people have no f***ing respect.”  Sofia Vergara In 2015, the “Modern Family” actress’ star was desecrated a month after it was installed. Protesters painted the words “Embryo Defense,” an apparent reference to a legal dispute between Vergara and her ex-fiance over whether she might destroy two frozen embryos from their relationship.  Bob Marley In late 2017, the star of the late reggae icon was damaged by someone with a hammer.  “Why would anyone do this to Bob Marley’s star? Help me understand,” said Hollywood Walk of Fame producer Ana Martinez, speaking for music fans everywhere. She called the act “disrespectful.”  John Lennon In 2013, three days before what would have been his 73rd birthday, Lennon’s star was defaced with several scrawled messages. Although none appeared to be negative, a Beatles fan club member called the doodlers “pigs” on Facebook.  Hugh Hefner In the days after the Playboy founder’s death in September 2017, a fan tried to pay tribute by scribbling “R.I.P” and a blue crown on Hef’s star. Because the vandal used an oil-like crayon instead of spray paint, the graffiti was easily cleaned up.  The stars are not cheap to replace There are now more than 2,600 celebrities’ stars embedded in sidewalks across a 15-block stretch of downtown Hollywood.  Whoever nominates a celebrity for a star usually pays the $40,000 cost of installing and maintaining the terrazzo and brass landmarks.  Keeping them clean and intact is not an easy task, which is why the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce — which oversees the Walk of Fame — has installed surveillance cameras in the hopes of deterring vandals.  “The Hollywood Walk of Fame is an institution celebrating the positive contributions of inductees. When people are angry with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark,” said the Chamber in a new statement.

Exclusive: Cosby Recording Could Prove Comedian Innocent ,"Login | Sign Up Featured-Money-Health-Beyond Science-Power of Belief-Sustainable Living-Inspiration-Live Stream-Video-Classic Home-All Categories Profile image 30 1 By Reaper (Reporter) Contributor profile | More stories Story Views Now: 1 Last Hour: 1 Last 24 Hours: 1 Total: 381 Exclusive: Cosby Recording Could Prove Comedian Innocent Saturday, September 22, 2018 20:20  Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Stumbleupon Share on Reddit    cosby 091018  Bill Cosby walks to the courtroom during his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa., Tuesday, June 6, 2017.  A source who can only be identified as a ‘neutral’ Montgomery County Court official, claims a tape played in court which helped convict Bill Cosby was either doctored or partly erased and the original recording contained information that would exonerate the comedian.  “No one in the media, no one on the defense really, have either asked me or pressed me or, to my knowledge, anyone else, about the tape,” said the individual, who has requested anonymity because identification could lead to employment loss and other sanctions.  Find Out More >  94,657 The recording in question aired during Cosby’s trial in April 2018 before a jury found him guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault for providing Benadryl tablets to former Temple University employee Andrea Constand and then engaging in foreplay where he touched her under her pants and she touched his penis.  “What did you give my daughter? I know my daughter ….,” Gianna Constand, Andrea’s mother, said in a decades-old conversation with Cosby.  However, a source said what’s been omitted from the tape could prove Cosby’s innocence.  “What’s not on the tape are two things. It was not what’s been reported, that this is some angry person,” the source said.  “She said, ‘Look Bill, I know my daughter and something is wrong with my daughter. Bill, I have to tell you something, what did you give my daughter?’”  Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... While that might sound consistent to the recording played inside the Montgomery County Courthouse in Pennsylvania, the source said here’s where the change or omission occurred.  “Mr. Cosby said to her, asked her point blank, ‘Are you accusing me of date rape?’ Mr. Cosby was incredulous because he knew and Gianna knew that he and Andrea’s relationship was consensual,” the source said.  Gianna Constand continued, according to the source:  “She said no, she wasn’t accusing him of date rape, but then you get to see her real motivation which was money because she said to him, ‘Bill, things are tough, I don’t know how I’m going to make it’ — and this is a married woman saying this so Mr. Cosby — just goes on to apologize for having the relationship with her daughter and she told him that his apology was enough and that she didn’t want anything else.”  When Cosby overheard a noise on the phone, he asked Constand whether he was being recorded and she denied she was recording saying that the sound was her pet parrot.  Testimony revealed that even while Constand surreptitiously recorded Cosby, she had already first searched for a civil lawyer and then called police.  “They ran out of money and this was a way of them getting money and Gianna Constand hated Blacks,” said Robert Russell, a former friend of the Constand family whose potential bombshell testimony was not allowed by Judge Steven T. O’Neill.  Russell said he was prepared to testify that Andrea Constand, at her mother’s direction, plotted to extort Cosby, who eventually settled a civil suit with Constand for $3.4 million.  Throughout the trial, those not in the courtroom were provided the mainstream media’s version of the tape, which many neutral observers said included so much bias that they believed the media worked in concert with prosecutors to convict Cosby and decimate his legacy.  For instance, it was widely reported in headlines and leads that “Cosby admits to being a dirty old man.”  However, the tape clearly reveals Cosby saying, “I don’t want you to think that I’m a dirty old man.”  Famed forensic psychiatrist Carole Lieberman, who has years of experience in hundreds of civil and criminal trials, said it’s appalling to discover – after Cosby’s conviction – that Gianna Constand may have doctored or left out parts of the recording that could have changed the face of the trial.  “To be honest, I always suspected that there was something off with his accuser and her story. The defense obviously did not do a good enough job for Cosby despite the hundreds of thousands they were paid,” Lieberman said.  “They should have sent this tape to a forensic analyst who would have been able to  tell that it was doctored. This is done on a routine basis in cases where tapes are involved,” she said.  Lieberman said even though Cosby is set to be sentenced on Sept. 25, it’s still not too late to right the wrong.  “First, the court should order that the tape be analyzed. If it is doctored, then a mistrial should be declared and his conviction should be thrown out,” Lieberman said.  “The prosecutors should be reprimanded and the defense attorneys should return the fees Cosby paid them. Otherwise, they should be sued for malpractice. If his conviction isn’t thrown out, he can appeal on the basis of ineffective representation by counsel,” she said. – ",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

A beach blanket is not only weighted down in the corners so it won’t blow away, it is sand resistant and larger for you to spread out. Plus, you won’t have to use your towel when lounging around, so it can stay sand-free and available to dry you off between your dips in the ocean.  With these items on your list, you will be prepared for anything that comes your way during your Hawaiian vacation. You’ll be perfectly ready to hit the beach and immerse yourself in island time.

Hoppin’ John is a popular choice because you can mix in rice, pork, greens and beans – all on the approved lucky foods list. In a Spanish household, another dish would be Congri which is white rice, black beans and pork. If you don’t like black eyed peas, lentils are also popular due to their green color. Any rice, including risotto are all good options as well, since they swell when you cook them, which represents abundance in the New Year.  Don’t forget about noodles. There are tons of recipes that call for noodles – just don’t cut the noodles – boil and serve them whole which represents long life.  Fish…all fish are a good main course except for catfish since they are bottom dwellers. Remember that the fish scales represent silver and fish swim forward good symbols for the new year. If you are only cooking for 1 or 2 people, fish tacos are quick and easy. Remember no turkey, chicken, steak, lamb, lobster or crab.  collage of mixed traditional christmas food  So to recap, here are some New Years lucky foods dinner and side dish ideas:  Warm kale and lentil salad Seafood Paella (recipe from Disney Cruise Line) Pork Tenderloin with sauerkraut Honey baked ham Shrimp stir fry (with long noodles such as soba) Fish tacos with slaw Seafood Risotto (recipe from Disney Cruise Line) Enchilado de camarones (shrimp in Cuban tomato sauce) Shrimp or pork lettuce wraps Soy and ginger glazed salmon Italian Tagliare Assorito (a/k/a Chopped Salad – recipe from Celebrity Cruise Line) Fettucine alfredo (don’t forget to leave noodles whole for luck) Black eyed peas with collard greens Cuban style lentils Lentil and rice salad Hoppin John Black bean soup 15 bean soup (Chef Nobu Matsuhisa’s) Black Cod with Miso Kielbasa with sauerkraut Roast pig Corn bread Southern style collard greens Shrimp and grits Portobello mushrooms stuffed with kale and rice Pork chops with onions, apples and cabbage Oven roasted whole red snapper Mushroom risotto Cabbage rolls Tuna stuffed peppers Spicy chili lentils Sauerkraut Braised pork with apples, onions & cabbage Shrimp noodle bowl with kale Sole with Sundried Tomato Risotto Soups: In the mood for soup? Make a fish stew, seafood boullabaisse or minestrone soup with lots of beans and veggies in it. You can also include Italian or Andouille sausage. Ribollita is a popular bean and veggie stew in Tuscany or try an Italian Fish soup.  Try a tomato bisque or a pumpkin soup.  Perhaps a meatless chili with several types of beans or a hearty mushroom soup. In Romania, they make Ciroba de Varza, which is cabbage soup.  Want to order out? For Chinese order a pork fried rice or pork lo mein. BBQ – have ribs or pulled pork. Italian – have pasta with sausage, cheese lasagna or a pepperoni and sausage pizza. Of course cheese pizza works too, I just try to keep sneaking that pig in there, since so many cultures believe it brings good luck both because it roots forward, which we all want to progress in the New Year, and also because their fatty meat is said to be symbolic for a fat wallet.  Desserts:  Round cakes, cookies, donuts and pies all work. If you want to impress, make some chocolate truffles. Try Grand Marnier Chocolate Volcano cake, Raspberry creme brulee, Looking for more healthy, try Almond Butter Balls.  Breakfast:  If you didn’t eat enough at the stroke of midnight and are in the mood for breakfast, stay away from omelets and go for round shaped items like quiche lorraine, donuts, crepes, pancakes or bagels. (round representing coins again.) Of course smoked salmon or white fish on your bagels combines the good luck from fish along with your round bagel.  We hope you enjoy these fun ideas, and wish you good fortune in the new year!

It is also where royals Prince William and Kate Middleton went for their honeymoon.  The Seychelles is the perfect romantic getaway for a honeymoon with plenty of activities for couples to do such as snorkeling and sightseeing, trekking through rainforest, or soaking up the sun on the beautiful untouched beaches.  The Seychelles is also the ideal venue for privacy and luxury– two things necessary for honeymooning like a royal.

Art and Museums In Philadelphia - Part 1 ,"Last month Eric and I went to Philadelphia to immerse ourselves in our country’s history. I was lucky enough to get the chance to work with Visit Philly to get ourselves to all of the city’s awesome landmark attractions. I want to start by talking about all the amazing art in Philly.     Philadelphia is home to some of my bucketlist travel items and, of course, those things were on the top of my itinerary. Let’s talk about the one place I’ve been wanting to visit for probably two decades. The Mütter Museum.    I am such a sucker for medical mysteries, weird medical things and how the human body is so different when it comes to different people. Unfortunately, I was not able to take any photos inside the actual exhibit part of the Mütter Museum, because there are still people on display that have living relatives that come to visit them and it is for their privacy. I did ask one of the security guards how many people got busted for trying to take pictures everyday and was told that at 11am, they already caught two. I’m not a rule breaker, even for my blog, so I’ll just explain some of the awesome stuff they had.   The Mütter Giant, as he’s called, can’t be contained in one photo.   The Mütter Museum is part of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia has the tallest human skeleton displayed in North America in their museum. He’s 7′ 6″ and is displayed with one of the smallest female skeletons, a woman who had dwarfism and was a prostitute, who then got pregnant and couldn’t naturally deliver her baby. Doctors tried to save her by sacrificing the baby, but didn’t succeed, so both died. It makes me so happy for our medical strides, because I’m sure this was not a rare occurrence in the past.  The museum also has a cast of Chang and Eng, conjoined twins who were made famous by Robert Ripley (of Ripley’s Believe It Or Not!) and were their own manager when they worked in the circus. The liver that they shared is on display (as well as one of their chairs) that was saved when the hospital (before it became a museum) did the the autopsy. Seeing this, I wonder if they were born 100 years later, if they couldn’t have been separated and led their own lives.   Look at these ear bones! (I was allowed to take pics of these in the lobby.)   There is a whole wall of skulls from people who died in a variety of ways, this crazy enlarged colon, things people have swallowed, extremities with gangrene, tumors and so much more. I was fascinated and horrified and then fascinated again. You can view how medical practices have changed so much over the years and it’s brilliant. We also happened to visit on World Polio Day, which seemed very fitting.  There are rotating exhibits, so even if you’ve been before, there will be something you haven’t seen, and I doubt you’ll not be able to find something you missed on your previous visit(s).    There are so many museums in the city, but the largest and most prominent is the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Inside you’ll find several floors of labyrinthine rooms.    Not only can you run up the Rocky steps (there are so many), but on the last Wednesday of the month, they have pay what you want after 5pm. It’s the only day it’s open late. If you love all kinds of art, this is the place for you, but give yourself 3 or more hours. We visited the featured exhibit, which was women’s fashion throughout history (can you tell the difference between the 80s and the 50s or the 70s and 90s). In some cases, the accessories totally made it work.    There is so much art to see, plus on the night we visited they were also having Oktoberfest in the lobby and a trick-or-treat scavenger hunt for kids, so there were tons of littles in costumes, which was almost as fun as the art. You’ll find room after room full of artwork of all sorts, from paintings to sculptures to glasswork. Make certain to wear your walking shoes, if only for the thousand steps you’ll need to navigate just to get to the front door.     You’ll find modern art, contemporary, impressionism, surrealism, and everything else you can think of. From Diego Rivera to Picasso to Monet to Manet, there’s almost no great artist left out. But I’ll leave you with my favorite piece done in bronze by Cecioni, which I entitled “Me when I meet a puppy.” I have no idea what’s happening in this piece, but I found it hysterical. I’m not sure if everyone’s happy or no one is happy but it made me happy, and I feel like that’s what I want out of art.     This angle is deceiving. There are these steps (probably 5 sets of 20) and then another set at the top past a courtyard.  As I said, you can run up the many, many, many steps and do your Rocky pose, or you can drag yourself up the stairs, wonder how you’ve only made it halfway up, and debate rolling back down to find an elevator. We encouraged each other to the top, saying that if the two year old we passed could make it up 10 steps that were half her height, we could make it the rest of the way up.     You can also get your pic taken with a statue of Sylvester Stallone as Rocky at the bottom of the steps in the front of the museum. Every time we passed by, there was a long line, but as we were leaving the museum in the evening, there weren’t any people waiting (not shocking, since it was dark out), so I made Eric take my picture. I’m sorry I didn’t do a “Yo Adrian!” pose. This is all I could muster.  This isn’t the end of Philadelphia’s art, but I feel like it’s enough for one part of a post and I’ll continue with it in the next post. I could easily have filled two posts with just finds from the PMOA. It’s much more fun to explore for yourself though.   Where is your favorite museum?  ",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

It’s nice from a camping standpoint, but you’ll be starting and ending each day on the few park roads as you commute to the surrounding areas cutting into your ride time each day.  US 441 – Newfound Gap Road – GSMNP(http://miles-by-motorcycle.com/51999/photos/52118/untitled/55155/us-441—newfound-gap-road—gsmnp)  Outside the Park – Towns around the park can be divided by compass direction – north, south, east, west.

Easy to get to and just half an hour south from Knoxville, these towns are dominated by tourist attractions like Dollywood, Ripley’s, Ober Gatlinburg, the Space Needle, Smoky Mountain Opree, and all kinds of venues geared to kids, families, shopping, nightlife, and the scenic park views. It’s a busy, bustling, and energetic place with loads of places to stay. Riding in this area is comparatively limited and the major roads congested. North of the park the mountains quickly subside into the broad Tennessee River Valley. The riding is to the east and west, look to the lesser traveled valleys and back roads. South takes you into the park.  Townsend – West of the big towns, Townsend stretches along the Little River into the park. It has a large tourism focus but is not as built up. Riding to the east means passing through the big towns, to the south is one entrance to the park.

Cosby / Newport – This is pretty rural country except for the main road (US 321) which passes though it.

The mountains continue their arc north from the park to the highest of the peaks still miles distant. This area is rural and undeveloped. The few roads that do run through it are outstanding mountain rides, even Interstate 40 cutting through the Tennessee River Gorge is spectacularly scenic. Small mountain towns dot the landscape, Hot Springs is one of them. The historic town has limited places to stay and eat and a campground on the French Broad River.  Asheville – A vibrant and beautiful small city. The Blue Ridge Parkway passes through it. You’ll find ample places to stay in the surroundings, and the city traffic can be escaped fairly quickly. Known for its food and beer culture, parking is an issue to the point walking is the way to go when downtown.

5 Great Ways To Entertain Guests During Your Thanksgiving Celebration ,"For those of you who are actively avoiding the Black Friday Shopping frenzy, and actually looking forward to spending meaningful time with your family and friends, National Report has lovingly put together a list of new and unique ways to create memorable experiences during this year’s Thanksgiving celebration.  Surprise Thanksgiving Roasts One great way to involve folks in holiday oriented entertainment is to make the tried-and-true Thanksgiving meal into an unwitting scavenger hunt! Similar to the traditional Mardi Gras King’s cake, in which a small coin or figure of baby Jesus is hidden inside, we recommend you hide something small or unexpected inside of at least one of the main dishes or desserts. Staff picks include a set of false teeth submerged in Great Aunt Muriel’s homemade cherry cheesecake, or a modest bag of mixed prescription medication concealed in the mashed potatoes.  Once these unanticipated objects have been discovered, announce the finder as the subject of a brutal holiday roast! This game is a hilarious idea for all-inclusive entertainment, as everyone can criticize and berate the winner under the pretense of light-hearted ribbing, providing hours of amusement, and an acceptable excuse to dish out both emotional abuse, while creating fond memories for years to come.  Truth Or Dare Do you suspect your family and/or friends are holding out on some dark secrets or privy to juicy need-to-know gossip? Well, there’s no better way to really know your loved ones more intimately than to play an alcohol-fueled variant of truth or dare, also known as Spin the Bottle! If alcohol may not be effective for the family that already regularly drinks together, just use the CIA’s favorite truth serum, Scopolamine, and spike their drinks.  Of course, children must be excluded from this game due to its adult themes, so I suggested you shut them away in a distant room as to prevent any trauma due to all the familial skeletons figuratively pouring out of the closet. Who knew that Aunt Terri actually DID get rid of Uncle Berry for his $100,000 life insurance policy, and that he wasn’t simply a victim of an unfortunate, and unsolved hit-and-run accident? You never know what you might learn about your family’s history!  Outdoor Scavenger Hunt Like most Thanksgiving celebrations, it is likely your guests have had at least two other meals under their belt before the main event. Consequently, in order to work up a genuine appetite for your Thanksgiving spread, have them embark on a harrowing scavenger hunt through a rented corn maze! (The bigger, the better.) Not only will it make them feel genuinely thankful for all the work you’ve done to host this holiday event but also provide you with enough time to actually finish the cooking!  Provide your party with a flare gun and a small flashlight in case they get lost in the maze, or are unable to understand the clues you’ve dispersed randomly around the cornfield. That way they can find each other, and hopefully signal for help as darkness falls. The first ones out of the maze get to have the initial choice of their favorite foods, while the last to finish have to wash all the dishes, providing them with plenty of incentive to participate!  Cosplay Our next suggestion is to recreate an authentic Thanksgiving holiday by cosplaying as your favorite pilgrims from the Mayflower, complete with costumes and a vastly limited spread of food reminiscent of a meager Paleolithic diet. Hire real Native Americans to sit alongside your family and eat with you, just as they had with the pilgrims!  Keep it traditional by trading them in dried corn, glass beads, and firewater for their service, and insist that they too attend the meal in historically accurate attire, such as leather loincloths, feathered headbands and a necklace of real human scalps.  Invite The Homeless Turn your house into a surprise soup kitchen for the disenfranchised and unfortunate without informing your guests before they arrive!  Before turning your homestead into an impromptu food trough for the poor and downtrodden, it is highly recommended that you put up chicken wire to prevent them from getting into undesirable areas, such as your organic tomato garden, underwear drawer or medicine cabinet.  Thanksgiving is full of human-interest pieces and Facebook images about selfless individuals providing hot meals to the needy on a day known for generosity and goodwill. Bring this instant karmic good luck to you and all your loved ones by getting them unknowingly involved with your philanthropic endeavors. Put them on the spot as they are surrounded by shambling drug addicts and the streams of urine left in their wake. They will not be able to refuse an opportunity to brag about their charitable and selfless holiday on the nearest social media platform, especially before starting their Black Friday binge shopping!",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

Woman Comes Forward With Shocking Allegation: “I Was Not Raped By Bill Cosby” ,"n a shocking turn of events, area woman Joyce Taylor has broken her silence and proclaimed, “I was not raped by Bill Cosby.”  This news came on the day that two more defendants joined in the growing defamation case against the once beloved entertainer.  ** UPDATE: COSBY ADMITTED TO DRUGGING WOMEN IN 2005 DEPOSITION **  According to Ms. Taylor, she once met with Mr. Cosby decades ago at a Hollywood night club at the age of 17.  As the night progressed, she became increasingly intoxicated before her boyfriend, 18 year-old Danny Stevens, helped her home where she awoke the next morning alone, with full memory of what had not transpired the night before.  In a sworn statement given to officials earlier today, Ms. Taylor states, “Why was I not raped by Mr. Cosby?  Was I not pretty enough?  Did I do something wrong?  I mean I may have been a bit overweight, but I was still rapeable (sic).  These are all feelings I have struggled with since that fateful night in 1974.”     Bob Murphy, the attorney representing Ms. Taylor, had this to say, “I understand Joyce’s concerns, I mean she was in the right place at the right time, and feels she was entitled to be raped, but in a way, I think we have all been raped by Mr. Cosby.”  Since November, at least 15 women have come forward claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Cosby.  Cosby, who starred as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on “The Cosby Show” from 1984 to 1992, has not been formally charged in connection with any of the allegations and has denied his involvement.  Cosby’s career has unraveled since the allegations began and he has hired an extensive team of Public Relations experts in attempt to save what is left of his reputation going so far as to blame the victims themselves.  In the years since the non-incident took place, Joyce Taylor has sought counseling and has been treated for depression. “The last forty years, my weight’s gone up and down like a yo-yo.”  When “The Cosby Show” went off the air in ’92 I got things under control, but when he came back with another show four years later, I blew up like a damn balloon.  Now he’s in the news again and I’m fighting the urge to ‘make the plate my mate.’  It’s a struggle,” admitted Taylor, “but I’m not going to turn not being raped by Bill Cosby into a negative.”  It is presumed there are many more Joyce Taylor’s, possibly millions, out there waiting to tell their story of not being raped by Cosby, however as of press time National Report was unable to find any additional victims.  This development only leads to more confusion surrounding the multitude of accusers suggesting that they had in fact been raped by Mr. Cosby.  Cosby’s publicist David Brokaw and lawyer Martin Singer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake
"Millions Mourn As Rocker/Activist Ted Nugent, Age 68, Found Alive ","Millions of Americans are in mourning after news broke this afternoon that rocker/activist Ted Nugent was still alive. Word broke early, spread quickly, and sent shock waves throughout the rock and roll community and the Republican Party, where Nugent, 68, is well-known for his fierce advocacy for conservative causes, unwavering support for the rights of gun owners and hunters, and ferocious loyalty and devotion to today’s true American patriots. The National Rifle Association issued the following statement:  Ted Nugent has proudly and patriotically served on the NRA’s board of directors since 1995. The Association shares a deep sense of shock with our 4.5 million members and countless millions of supporters as details of this catastrophic event continue to unfold.  PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), one of several organizations Nugent violently criticized in the past, also issued a statement expressing condolences.     Originally from Detroit, Michigan, Nugent initially found fame as lead guitarist for The Amboy Dukes before embarking on a solo career. Highlights from Nugent’s life include a 1977 interview appearing in High Times magazine, in which he famously told a reporter how he avoided the [Viet Nam War] draft: he did not bathe, brush his teeth, or shave for 30 days leading up to his pre-induction physical. To sweeten the pot, he also defecated in his pants. “I was so proud,” Nugent recalled. In later years he denied those accounts, saying he made up the story to trick the gullible reporter. That same year, Nugent’s song Cat Scratch Fever dominated the rock and roll charts.  President Obama, the target of many of Nugent’s negative comments, reportedly expressed astonishment when informed during a cabinet meeting that Nugent had lived another day. During the White House’s daily media briefing, Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz informed the assembled press corps that the President asked members of his cabinet to join him in a moment of silence to acknowledge Nugent’s survival.  Throughout Detroit and surrounding suburbs, fans both old and new erected makeshift tributes to the rocker, lighting candles, singing songs, and leaving cards and ticket stubs from many of Nugent’s concerts as testimonials to a life still lived.

Emmy Awards Announce Addition of “Best Crisis Actor” Category ,"Crisis actors have been fighting for over a decade to get a category for their work added to The Oscars, but it was the Television Academy this week that showed its branch is more open minded when it comes to updating its awards ceremony to reflect the current landscape of entertainment.   The Television Academy announced Friday that the Emmys are expanding to include a “Best Crisis Actor” category. TV Academy chairman and CEO Bruce Rosenbloom tells National Report, “It’s time to acknowledge the incredible work crisis actors are doing. They bring some of the most heart-stopping performances to the screen, sometimes while events are still playing out on live television. It’s time they are recognized and rewarded for their contributions to the industry.”  Crisis actors are professional actors used by government agencies and/or the mainstream media to deceive the public with portrayals of trauma and human suffering. Specifically, they act as victims or witnesses in staged mass shootings or hoax terrorist attacks (i.e. ‘False Flags’).  Crisis actor on set Crisis actor on set  While many in the industry still believe crisis actors are one dimensional and undeserving of their own award, many are just now starting to appreciate the challenges they face on set.  How can the crisis actor take action in the imagined world that will move the storyline in an unforeseen direction? How can he or she make critical decisions that explore different options without giving up the narrative that is necessary to deliver a compelling experience? Those questions and more will ultimately decide who is nominated for this year’s prestigious new award.  Veteran crisis actor, Xavier Daniels, says while it would be an honor to win the first ever Best Crisis Actor Award, it’s not what motivates him. “I want the people hiring me for a gig, be it the government or just some local gun shop looking to boost sales, to know I won’t let them down. I will never break character like some of these hacks, and they can feel safe knowing I’m in the role.”  Makayla Williams, a newbie to the scene, says most crisis actors never make it past the audition phase. “You have to really dedicate yourself for this kind of performance art,” said Williams. “Sometimes to get into character I will have my boyfriend beat the hell out of me, so when I go live on TV my adrenaline is still pumping. Hopefully it helps give the viewers at home a real sense of authenticity.”  Jimmy Kimmel returns to host the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards airing live on Sunday, September 18th on ABC.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake
Actress Comes Forward With Shocking Allegation: “I Was Not Sexually Assaulted By Harvey Weinstein” ,"<National Report>In a shocking turn of events, actress Joyce Taylor has broken her silence and proclaimed, “I was not sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein.”  This news comes on the heals of multiple allegations published by the New  York times against the once beloved Hollywood executive. According to Ms. Taylor, she met Mr. Weinstein at a Hollywood night club at the age of 19.  As the night progressed she became increasingly intoxicated and found herself alone with the alleged serial harasser.  In a sworn statement given to officials Ms. Taylor states, “Why was I not sexually assaulted by Mr. Weinstein?  Was I not pretty enough?  Did I do something wrong?  I mean I may have been a bit overweight.  Was I not worthy of being assaulted?  These are all feelings I have struggled with since that fateful night.”  Bob Murphy, the attorney representing Ms. Taylor, had this to say, “I understand Joyce’s concerns, I mean she was in the right place at the right time, and feels she was entitled to be fondled, forced to perform fellatio, raped, something, anything.  In a way I think we have all been assaulted by Mr. Weinstein.”  The New York Times describes Mr. Weinstein as follows:  “(He) helped to reinvent the model for independent films, with movies such as “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “The English Patient,” “Pulp Fiction,” “The Crying Game,” “Shakespeare in Love,” and “The King’s Speech.” Beyond Hollywood, he has exercised his influence as a prolific fund-raiser for Democratic Party candidates, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weinstein combined a keen eye for promising scripts, directors, and actors with a bullying, even threatening, style of doing business, inspiring both fear and gratitude. His movies have earned more than three hundred Oscar nominations, and, at the annual awards ceremonies, he has been thanked more than almost anyone else in movie history, just after Steven Spielberg and right before God.”  It is presumed there are more Joyce Taylor’s, possibly millions, out there waiting to tell their story of not being assaulted by Weinstein, however as of press time National Report was unable to find any additional non-victims.  This development only leads to more confusion surrounding the multitude of accusers suggesting that they had in fact been sexually assaulted by Mr. Weinstein.  ",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

Jr Smith Admits He Drank Hennessy During Halftime Of Game 1 Of The NBA Finals ,"CLEVELAND – Days after the controversial Game 1 of the NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors, Cavs guard Jr smith admitted that he was slightly drunk during the second half and overtime.  Everybody has heard about the Cavs final play of regulation, when George Hill missed his second free throw that could’ve gave his team a 1 point lead, which followed by Jr Smith getting the rebound and running out the clock rather than go for the last shot to win the game.

Jr Smith was apparently drinking Hennessy cognac during halftime, a drink that Jr Smith is apparently known for liking.

Teammates and locker room officials say they have no idea how Jr was able to take shots of henny during halftime with none of them noticing. “If there’s one thing Jr is good at, it’s drinking with nobody noticing, because it ain’t basketball.” said Lebron James.

Michael Jordan Lowering Price to 19.99 On All Jordan’s By The End Of 2017 ,"“I’m just tired of people paying for the illusion that more expensive means better, when in reality my shoes cost $5 to make” Said basketball legend Michael Jordan on why he is lowering the price on his super popular Air Jordan brand sneakers.  MJ is sick and tired of blacks killing blacks over his high priced shoes. He wants to set a precedent by showing people that spending more money on something exclusive doesn’t make you special it just makes you a fool with money. Michael Jordan feels bad for all these young black males with these large Jordan shoe collections but they don’t have one red cent invested in Jordan or Nike Stock and he would like to save them from themselves.  He will make the transition in lowering the prices nationwide slowly over the course of the next couple months to deter any backlash in the black community we’re told some store like Target and Wallmart will also carry Jordan brand shoes.  “I think he smokin crack, you know how much money I spent on my Jordan collection?, I buy these to be a star in my hood, everywhere I go they call me Young Retro, if he make em cheap like them starbury’s I’m taking my shoe collection talents to Lebron” said disgruntled Jordan collector Malik “Young Retro” Wilburn.  We will have to wait and see how this change will effect the crime rate in the black community as well as MJ’s pockets.  Although Jordans approach is awesome. The problem is most people want Jordans so they can fulfill what’s lacking in their life like praise, self esteem, acceptance, and so forth. Those kids need to grow up and stop collecting shoes and start collecting stocks, bonds, & other investments.  ",SPORTS,Fake

New Study Finds That People Who Are Dallas Cowboys Fans Are More Likely To Be Assholes ,"DALLAS, TX – A recent study published by the Ledger’s Journal of Heath & Physiology has established a connection between supporting the Dallas Cowboys and the likelihood of being an asshole (or thereabouts).  Titled ‘The Association and Mediation of the Relationships Between Masculinity Ideology, Outcome Expectations, and Dallas Cowboys Fandom’, the study gathered a pool of 376 male participants between the ages of 16 and 65 (with a median age of 24), asking them a series of questions.  The results concluded a strong correlation between widely regarded backward views (for example, (‘homosexuals should never marry’) and a affinity for the Dallas Cowboys.  An excerpt from the journal entry reads as follows as followed:  The Association and Mediation of the Relationships Between Masculinity Ideology, Outcome Expectations –   Fans of the professional American Football team, the Dallas Cowboys, account for more of a percentage of such than any other team in the league, one of the many reasons the Cowboys are commonly referred to as “America’s Team.”  With 30% of fans living in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex area, a census of the pool of people beyond a 30 mile radius range of a team’s respective stadium account for more than any other team.  icon  HSCAC studies previous have found the stigma of Cowboys fans across the United States of America has been more negatively received by fans of other NFL teams along with bothered peoples outside the association of any professional football team. Based on the Rialli Jones Journal of Word Association, the English word ‘Asshole’ tops the list of words with a derogatory notion in association with fans of the Dallas Cowboys. Used in vulgarism pejoratively (as a type of synecdoche) to associate a noun the anus, ‘asshole’ makes up for 13% of disparaging of all words with a negative connotation.   376 Dallas Cowboys fans were surveyed in the study with 20 questions each, with the grade implicating endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology. 290 of persons questioned (77%) finished with an algorithmic score offering a link between predicators of cheering for the Cowboys and ‘assholeness’ (classified as the combination of rudeness, arrogance, association with “Dem Boyz”, slight barbarian behavior, inept to other’s opinions and ungraciousness. (PsycINFO Database Record)  The findings aren’t exactly surprising. The average Dallas Cowboys fan is a conglomerate of a middle aged, white male, brought up with a sense of entitlement based on past achievements whether they had any association in such, along with a falsified and skewed view of the future.  The results from the survey converted onto the Dynamic Fan Equity scale showed a steady increase in delusional based on the longevity of the fandom towards to Cowboys, with males 35 and older showing more aptitude towards false hope yet an eagerness to regard the facility of such. The only teams with more than 1.5 million fans on respective Facebook page that have not won a Super Bowl in recent years are the Cowboys and Bears.

Tony Romo Arrested In North Carolina For Using Mens Bathroom ,"CHARLOTTE, NC – There has been heated controversy over the recent legislation implemented by the leaders of the state of North Carolina.  The state made headlines and created a relative uproar after maintaining its stance on the LGBT community, essentially vetoing a bill that would protect those who are gay, bisexual, and transgender from discrimination.  The House Bill 2, known as HB2, has been criticized as being discriminatory toward transgender people. The statewide policy bans individuals from using public bathrooms that do not correspond to their biological sex and prohibits cities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances to protect gay and transgender identity, per CNN.  The Justice Department has filed a civil rights lawsuit against North Carolina and several entertainers have canceled planned performances there in protest.  “It’s dangerous, and it goes beyond bathrooms,” protesters are proclaiming.  Though there has been no cases which this law has been called into regard previous to recently, the state may have it’s first case on hand.  Thursday afternoon at approximately 4:57pm ET , North Carolina Police detained a man, later to be identified as Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, for using the men’s restroom in the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport.  Screen Shot 2016-05-18 at 3.24.36 PM  Police say they received a complaint from numerous bystanders and patrons inside the bathroom complaining of a person who didn’t belong there.  When asked how police recognized that the man who they received complaints about may have been a women, they pointed towards the Cowboys apparel Romo was wearing at the time. “It was a dead giveaway,” said officer Mike Roseman.  Under the state law, Romo was technically prohibited from using the men’s bathroom even if he identified as a man.  In Romo’s statement to police, the QB said, ” I don’t know what I was thinking. I could have swore I saw the proper sign but it was apparently something else. I have a hard time reading things. It happens a lot. Even off the field. Bathroom signs? Try defenses.” He added, “I was just trying to carry on with my business when you guy’s intercepted me.”  There’s no time table on if Romo will be charged with a crime or if he’ll receive disciplinary reparation from the NFL or the Dallas Cowboys.",SPORTS,Fake
UAB Running Back Greg Bryant Was Shot And Killed Saturday ,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — UAB running back Greg Bryant was shot and killed Saturday in South Florida, the school said. He was 21.  Bryant, a former Notre Dame player, and passenger Maurice Grover were found shot in a car along southbound Interstate 95 in West Palm Beach, police told The Palm Beach Post. Grover had minor injuries, police said.  ”We lost a member of our Blazer family today with the senseless passing of Greg Bryant,” Blazers coach Bill Clark said. ”We were so excited to recruit Greg, welcome him to Birmingham and to UAB football, and get to know him over the past several months. Greg was a very special talent and young man. He always had a smile on his face. While he was with us for a short time – too short – he was a big part of an exciting and historical time for our program and will always be a Blazer.”  Clark said in an earlier statement that Bryant had been surrounded by family as he received treatment for gunshot wounds.  Bryant was the biggest name in UAB’s first recruiting class since the school restarted the football program.  He spent last season living out of a hotel room in Miami with friends while attending classes at ASA College, playing in only one game. Bryant left Notre Dame after one season when he was ruled academically ineligible for the 2015 season.  ”Greg worked extremely hard this spring on the field and in the classroom,” Clark said. ”He told me his GPA this semester was the highest he has had in his life, and he was very proud. The light really went on for him here, and he had a bright future ahead of him.”  Since UAB won’t play again until the 2017 season, Bryant was allowed to enroll in January 2016 instead of possibly having to wait an extra year to get eligible elsewhere. He could become eligible to compete after spending an academic year at UAB.  ”Coach Clark, he really did me a favor, because I was living in hotels in Miami,” Bryant told The Associated Press before national signing day in February. ”He said I could come in as soon as the semester was over.

D’Angelo Russell To Be Banned From The NBA For Disregarding Player Privacy ,"LOS ANGELES – After Los Angeles Lakers point guard D’Angelo Russell posted a video on snapchat featuring teammate Nick Young, who appeared to be completely unaware he was being recorded, admitting to cheating on his Fiancé Iggy Azalea, the NBA announced that D’Angelo Russell will be permanently banned from the NBA for disregarding player privacy and breaking “locker room rules”, and thus forcing the Los Angeles Lakers to waive Russell.  The infamous video (Below)was posted by D’Angelo Russell as his snapchat story. seen by hundreds of thousands of people, including Iggy Azalea herself. Russell is now being shunned by pretty much almost everybody, especially his teammates. “There are levels to the rules,” said SportsNation co-host Marcellus Wiley, who played in the NFL for 10 seasons. “The violations start at pillow talk, and that happens in every single locker room. Guys are talking amongst guys, and someone goes home and tells their significant other, and that turns to gossip, and someone else hears about it from the outside and it comes back into the locker room. That’s a misdemeanor, because it happens so often. But what D’Angelo did was felonious. This is the worst example I’ve ever seen. This is damning.” Watch video:    Because of the video, D’Angelo Russell will join the small list of individuals who have been banned from the NBA, which includes former L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has announced that he will allow the regular season to end, around mid-April, before banning Russell for good. D’Angelo Russell will have no other option except to play professional basketball overseas. Subscribe to huzlers.com for regular updates and notifications straight to your email.",SPORTS,Fake
John Cena Accidentally Says “You Can’t See Me” To A Blind Kid ,"During one of his many meet-and-greet sessions at children’s hospitals across the nation, John Cena made an embarrassing gaffe by saying “You can’t see me” to a little blind boy.  Cena waved his right hand in front of his face, flashed a friendly smile and said “You can’t see me” to 11-year-old Timothy Greene, who suffers from a degenerative neurological disorder that affects his optic nerves.  An awkward hush fell over the lounge in Manhattan Pediatric Hospital, where several children and their parents were gathered for the much-anticipated meeting with Cena.  A WWE public relations associate then whispered to Cena that Timothy is legally blind, which caused Cena to turn pale and stammer something about “hustle, loyalty and respect.”  Timothy later said he wasn’t bothered by Cena’s comment, and insisted he found the whole thing kind of funny.  “Cena sucks anyway,” he said. “I’m a CM Punk fan.”",SPORTS,Fake
BREAKING: Chicago Cubs Believed To Have Sold Their Souls To The Devil For Success (Read Details) ,"CHICAGO – The Chicago Cubs are making history! For the first time ever at Wrigley Field, the Cubs have won a postseason series. Since Wrigley field opened in 1914, 101 years ago, The Cubs have not won a postseason series until today, after winning the division series against the St. Louis Cardinals 3 games to 1. Surely an unforgettable weak for Cubs fans in Chicago.  Many are asking, how are the Cubs so good all of a sudden? Is it real skill, luck, or is it something else that’s going on? Unfortunately, we are sad to inform you that the the entire Cubs roster, including the coaches and managers, have reportedly sold their souls to the devil shortly before the beginning of the season back in April. Officials, skeptical of the Cubs’ luck and talent to clinch a spot in the NLCS, decided to enter the Chicago Cubs locker room. Officials discovered a large pentagram drawn on the floor of the locker room. Officials also found the players sitting in a circle around the pentagram praying in an unknown language, with candles all over the place. “I couldn’t believe it”, says the official who walked into the locker room, “It was scary. I thought I had died and went to hell for a second”.  Stories of people selling their souls for fame, fortune, and in this case, luck and skill, is not new. Many people believe in the existence of the illuminati, as well as powers granted by the devil, upon selling your soul to him. And it seems like the Cubs were sick and tired of losing.  The real question here is— Will the Cubs actually win the NLCS, and later the World Series? Will selling their souls really pay off?

Chicago Cubs Purposely Lost Last 26 Years So They Could Fulfill Back To The Future’s 2015 Cubs Victory Prediction? ,"CHICAGO – Who doesn’t love the ‘Back To The Future’ trilogy? Well, as much as you may love it, you probably don’t love it as much as Chicago Cubs fans, better yet the Chicago Cubs themselves. The 1989 film ‘Back to The Futue 2′ predicted that the Chicago Cubs would finally win the World Series in 2015 (If you didn’t know, we are in 2015). And just yesterday, The Cubs beat The Pittsburg Pirates 4-0 In a wild-card match, which marks their first postseason victory since 2003. Coincidence? OR NOT?  The Chicago Cubs have not won a World Series since 1908, over 100 years ago. It is the longest championship drought of any North American professional sports team. I think it’s safe to say that no living human being can remember the Cubs’ last victory. It’s no surprise that Cubs fans loved Back to The Future 2, as it gave them a small glimpse of what that fateful day would be like. Could 2015 finally be the year?  Have the Cubs intentionally been losing for the past 26 years, just so they can finally fullfill Back to The Future’s prediction? Speculations arose after Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon reportedly told reporters: “2015 has finally come. We can finally try and win”. Whatever it meant, it sure seemed rather fishy. Is this just another marketing strategy for Back to The Future, happened to strike a deal with the Cubs? Have the Cubs been good all along? Whatever it is, we still want the Cubs to win, and we wish them good luck. We also heard Steve Bartman was secretly planning a 2015 comeback, hopefully he is actually arrested this time.

New Research Suggest That Men Who Cheat On Their Spouse Are More Honest And Emotional ,"This, of course, begs the question: Why? Why do men really cheat? And why do they sometimes continue cheating after they’re caught, even in the face of profoundly unwanted consequences like divorce, loss of parental contact, loss of social standing, and the like?  The truth is that all sorts of dynamics can play into a man’s decision to engage in infidelity. Generally, though, his choice to cheat is driven by one or more of the following factors:  Love: Most men cheat because they just love so much they can’t control themselves and sometimes this leads to cheating but he cheats because he a lover.  Honesty: Sometime a man is so honest with another woman it might lead to a sexual encounter with another female.  Emotional: Men try not to show their emotions but like anyone sometimes they need a shoulder to cry on and this may lead to accidental cheating  Accidental: Most men don’t cheat purposely sometimes is accidental forgiving your man for accidentally cheating can help you build a better relationship with your partner.  It’s Your Fault: Most men don’t cheat because they are tempted but pushed by their spouse to cheat you have to look in the mirror and ask yourself what are you doing wrong  It’s your fault Again: He may have undervalued his need for supportive friendships with other men, expecting his social and emotional needs to be met entirely by his significant other. And when she inevitably fails in that duty, he seeks fulfillment elsewhere.  Confusion about Limerence versus Commitment: He might misunderstand the difference between romantic intensity and long-term love, mistaking the neurochemical rush of early romance, technically referred to as limerence, for love, and failing to understand that in healthy, long-term relationships limerence is replaced over time with less intense, but ultimately more meaningful forms of connection.  The moral of this research suggest that men who cheat are the men you need around you if your husband or boyfriend is too honest he’s hiding something from you a man who cheats is open and you know his faults and could help him grow as a person.",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake

Man Allergic To Peanut Butter Hospitalized After Girlfriend Spreads Peanut Butter On Her Vagina ,"Bakersfield, CA – A Californian man is being hospitalized after his girlfriend spread peanut butter on her vagina to punish her cheating boyfriend.  Jane Lee Hopkins, 21, allegedly spread peanut butter on her vagina to teach her boyfriend a lesson after suspecting him of infidelity, fully knowing he had a severe peanut allergy.  Mike Hunt, 24, was diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy since birth and luckily had an EpiPen when his allergic reaction to peanuts became evident moments during sexual intercourse.  “When he went down on me and I saw his lips blow up minutes later, I felt horrible,” Hunt’s girlfriend told reporters in tears.

7 Of The Luckiest Casino Wins Ever ,"They say ‘fortune favors the brave’ and this can lead to some pretty reckless behavior in casinos all over the world. But every so often that bravery results in a seriously big win for someone. After all, isn’t it most people’s dream to put their last coin into a slots machine and see the jackpot come pouring out, or to pick their lucky number of the roulette wheel and see it come in? Here are seven stories of victories that have come against all the odds.  Sean Connery    Most famous as the quintessential James Bond, Sean Connery has become synonymous with smooth sophistication later in his career, as well as being a natural inhabitant of the casino. But Connery has proved himself as an accomplished gambler all his life. One night in a casino in the Italian Alps back in 1963, Connery was playing roulette. He placed a bet on 17 black. It failed so he repeated it, and lost again. Undeterred, he bet once again on the same number. This time, it came in. Rather than taking his winnings and calling it a night, he put them all on exactly the same number not once but twice and won both times. The result: an actor who was suddenly richer by 17 million lire – or around $230,000 at today’s rates.  Archie Karas    When Archie Karas arrived in Las Vegas in 1992, he had just $50 in his pockets, having recently lost £2million in a poker game in Los Angeles. His first stroke of luck was running into a friend who lent him £10,000 to buy into a game of Razz, a poker variant in which the lowest hand wins. Over the next three years he managed to amass a fortune of around $40million through a combination of poker playing and pool hustling, but his luck wasn’t destined to last. In a terrible run of bad fortune, he lost it all at craps, baccarat and poker. But he wasn’t a man to be kept down. Within three weeks he’d already managed to win back $1million, having borrowed $40,000 to set him on his way.  Patricia Demauro    Someone who had rather better luck at craps was Patricia Demauro. On 23rd May 2009, she had what must be one of the best ever examples of beginner’s luck. Demauro, a grandmother from New Jersey, visited the Borgata casino in New Jersey and played craps for only the second time in her life. Starting out with $100, she proceeded to convert it into hundreds of thousands of dollars by making 154 successive winning throws over 4 hours and 18 minutes. The odds of this happening were an estimated 1 in 1.56 trillion – and even she admits that she didn’t really understand what was happening. Demauro absolutely smashed the previous record of 147 successive winning dice throws held by a player known only as The Captain. Quite how Demauro came to hold the craps world bet is one of gambling’s most remarkable stories – and it makes for incredible reading.  Don Johnson    2011 was a tough time for casinos in the US with revenues falling thanks to the global economic slump. So many were desperate to attract high rollers in the hope of generating extra income. One blackjack player, Don Johnson, negotiated special terms in exchange for his custom, especially an agreed payback of 20% of his losses. So even if he dropped $100,000 in a session he’d still get $20,000 of it back. This, along with other concessions he’d negotiated to alter the standard rules of the game, meant that within three months he’d made a cool $15million. Johnson now claims he’s not welcome in many casinos, but with that much cash in the bank he may not be particularly bothered about this.  Ashley Revell    Ashley Revell is remarkable not for the amount that he won at the casino, but the way in which he won it. One day he was with friends in his home city of London when they were discussing what a blast it could be to bet all of your possessions on the spin of a roulette wheel. So that’s what he decided he would do, selling everything off and heading for Las Vegas with $115,000 in his pocket. He was put up in some style by the Plaza Hotel and Casino who saw it as a great publicity stunt. Ashley was planning to put everything on black but family and followers persuaded him to switch to red. This proved to be a good move as, unbelievably, it came up – and he headed home with $220,000 to his name.  Amy Nishimura    When Amy Nishimura headed off to Las Vegas for a Christmas break in 2003, there was no way that she could have anticipated the present she was due to receive. On the very first day of her holiday she put $100 in credit into a slots machine called Megabucks. $60 later she was looking at a jackpot of $8,919,598 at odds of over 1.6 million to 1. Although Amy had been playing the slots since the 1980s she’d never dreamt she’d ever win such a life-changing amount of money. In fact, when she was asked how she planned to spend it, she was simply lost for words.  Elmer Sherwin    Our final casino winner was also left speechless when he too won a big slots jackpot. One day in 2005 when he was visiting the Cannery Casino & Hotel in Las Vegas the 92-year-old WW2 veteran felt that a Megabucks machine was due to pay out. It turns out he was right and he picked up a $21,147,947 jackpot, part of which he donated to the Hurricane Katrina relief fund. But what makes the story really incredible is the fact that in 1989 he had already won $4.6 million from a slot in the newly-opened Mirage on the Las Vegas Strip.  Proof, as if it were ever needed, that lightning really can strike twice…",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake
"Man Calls Girlfriend ‘Yanny’ During Sex, Swears He Said ‘Laurel’ ","James Beacon and Laurel Cunningham were mid-coitus last night when James did the unthinkable: called his girlfriend by the wrong name. Although Beacon clearly remembers saying her name – Laurel – she swears that she heard him say “Yanny”.  They immediately stopped having sex after the incident as Cunningham began to grill him about this “other woman”.  “Who the hell is Yanny,” she reportedly asked him, through tears.  But Beacon had no memory of saying the name Yanny and insisted that Cunningham had misheard him.  “He was gaslighting me, plain and simple,” says Cunningham. “He said ‘Yanny’. There’s absolutely no way he said anything else. Like if you had been there and heard him and told me he said ‘Laurel’, I’d be like ‘You’re wrong. Is this some sort of prank? What is happening?’”  Still, Beacon asserts that he didn’t say ‘Yanny’, and would have no reason to.  “Why would I call my girlfriend Yanny,” he says. “Whose name is Yanny? That’s neither a name or a word. I heard myself say Laurel. Am I going insane?”  The two are now meeting with a couple’s counselor and consulting a hearing specialist to get to the bottom of this mix up.  “If he’s telling the truth, then I need to know the science behind it,” says Cunningham. “Is it a frequency thing? Was it like, the way I was laying down or the fact that my legs were up in the air or something? I’m feeling totally batshit crazy over this.”  At press time, Beacon was undergoing medical tests to see if he is possibly an automated computer system, and not a human being.  “We haven’t ruled anything out,” says Cunningham. “But if I’ve been dating a computer this whole time, I’m going to be so pissed.”",ENTERTAINMENT,Fake
Top 5 People We Wish Were Dissolved By Thanos ,"Most of us have seen Marvel Avengers: Infinity War already, but even if you haven’t, there’s probably a good chance you’ve seen the “disappearing memes” memes people have been posting. If you don’t understand the disappearing pics yet then go Watch the film first! Here’s 5 people who we wish dissolved  1) Lil Tay  Probably the most annoying little girl you will ever encounter in your life, that being even if you are fortunate enough to never meet in person. Lil Tay is… we actually don’t even know who she is or where she came from, but you can find videos of here everywhere calling you “broke” and a “hater”. Apparently nobody even knows who her parents are, but they are most likely rich.    2) Russ  There are 2 reasons why you know Russ,either for his music or because everybody hates him. Why is he so hated in the hip-hop community? Russ has a long history of dissing drug-referencing rappers, and perhaps even Lil Peep after he died of a xanax overdose, many hated Russ for disrespecting a young dead rapper. BUT, that’s not only why he’s on this list, aside from being corny, Russ is extremely arrogant and you can easily tell by his interviews and tweets, go check them out if you feel like hating someone new.    3) Mark ZUCCerberg  Deleting meme pages since one can remember. Mark has the reputation of an evil CEO among large facebook and instagram page owners for the ridiculous and confusing guidelines both sites share, although many deleted pages do in fact violate the terms, many don’t, and page owners are left confused and angry. Oh wait, let’s not forget the whole facebook privacy scandal either!    4) Donald Trump  The man himself, Donald Trump. Hated by almost everybody, except his republican supporters of course. What can we say? Trump really does not care what people think of him. From Mexico’s wall, muslim ban, sexist sandals, to anti-gay remarks, Trump has pretty much said offense possible. Please do us this favor Thanos.  5) Kanye West  Normally Kanye isn’t hated at all, but lately Mr. West has gone to waste with his fans after he revealed via twitter he supported Trump. But wait, there’s more! Kanye even showed up to TMZ to tell the world he thinks slavery was a choice, which was even worse than the former. Not-so-wise words Kanye, not-so-wise at all.

"JANITOR WHO WORKED AT SPERM BANK SUSPECTED OF FATHERING 20,000 CHILDREN OVER 20 YEAR PERIOD ","Toronto police have opened an official investigation after the administrators of a Canadian sperm bank have accused a former employee of replacing hundreds of sperm donors’ specimens with his own. Robert Casgrain, 58, who has worked as a janitor at the Toronto-based fertility clinic since 1996, is suspected by administrators of switching hundreds of semen specimens with his own sperm over a 20 year period.  Administrators claim in the official police report that they estimate Casgrain could potentially be the father to over 22,000 children over a period stretching two decades.  Although Robert Casgrain’s motives for replacing the sperm donors’ samples with his own are not clear at the moment, legal experts believe these revelations could unleash a potential class-action lawsuit against the former janitor.  “We cannot confirm precisely how many births have resulted from Robert Casgrain’s manipulations with registered sperm donor specimens before proper DNA analysis is performed” warned Detective Sergeant Rod Patterson of the Toronto Police Service.   Detective Sergeant Rod Patterson of the Toronto Police Service warned that “even though the precise numbers are not known”, Robert Casgrain’s sperm “may have given birth to thousands of children over a 20 year period” he said during a press conference.  “He kept bragging that half of the clinic’s babies were his,” one former coworker told reporters when reached by phone. Administrators at the fertility clinic were warned by employees of Casgrain’s erratic behavior and installed hidden cameras in the embryology laboratory last month before eventually contacting the police.  According to one employee who witnessed the surveillance footage, Casgrain is seen emptying the vials of semen into a sink and filling one up with his own sperm while masturbating to pornographic material.  Although it is impossible at the moment to know how many births resulted of Robert Casgrain’s manipulations at the embryology laboratory, DNA tests performed on clinical samples over the next year should authenticate which specimens are from Casgrain.  Legal experts believe Casgrain could face a sentence as low as 18 months and up to three to five years in prison according to current Canadian laws.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
GREENPEACE ACTIVIST GETS ARM BITTEN OFF AFTER HUGGING A WHITE SHARK ,"An environmental activist was almost killed yesterday in the Indian Ocean after the great white shark he was trying to hug suddenly attacked him and bit his arm off. 21-year old Darrell Waterford, from Eugene in Oregon, was participating in a promotional video for Greenpeace, some 100 nautical miles away from the Australian city of Perth.  Along with four other members of the organization, Mr. Waterford decided to dive with some great white sharks in order to improve the marine predator’s public image and raise awareness about shark hunting.  The group shot some incredible footage during the first 30 minutes as they swam with a group of sharks caressing and even hugging the large animals.  Unfortunately for the young American, one of the sharks suddenly became aggressive after being hugged and suddenly attacked him.  It attacked Mr. Waterford and tore off his right arm right below the elbow. The young man lost a large amount of blood, but was able to get out of the water and was rapidly taken to the hospital.  Huei Li Chong, the leader of the expedition, described the violent attack in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  “The shark seemed really friendly at first, but then it went totally berserk. It charged Darrell and bit off his hand in an instant, so we all hurried out of the water before it killed us.” According to him, the shark might have turned aggressive after smelling blood in the water.  “Sharks can be affectionate an cuddly when they’re calm, but the smell of blood activates their predator instincts. It’s not their fault, and we shouldn’t hold them responsible.”  Huei Li Chong, who was diving with Mr. Waterford at the time of the attack, believes the shark may have become aggressive after smelling blood. Huei Li Chong, who was diving with Mr. Waterford at the time of the attack, believes the shark may have become aggressive after smelling blood.  Greenpeace has been campaigning for years against shark finning, which consists of the removal of fins from sharks, often while the shark is alive.  Despite the organization’s efforts, finning has increased dramatically since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures.  Greenpeace has been trying for years to improve the white shark’s image in order to obtain an international ban, similar to the international treaty that applies to commercial whaling.  Several members of the organization now fear that this incident will compromise their campaign to restore the white shark’s image as a peaceful marine creature.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
FLAT EARTH THEORIST DISAPPEARS WHILE SAILING TO THE “END OF THE WORLD” ,"A 68-year old man from California has gone missing in the Southern Indian ocean while attempting to reach “the End of the World”, hoping to demonstrate that Earth is flat. An international rescue mission has been launched this morning in order to Irvin Walters, a retired trucker and notorious member of the Flat Earth Movement.

They think our world is in fact disk shaped, with the Antartica surrounding it. Adepts of the Flat Earth theory believe that our planet isn’t spherical. They think our world is, in fact, disk-shaped and surrounded by Antartica.  Being convinced that Antarctica is only a thin ice wall surrounding a disk-shaped Earth, he hoped to cross it and take pictures at the end of the disk.  Mr. Walters was reported missing by his family in California after he missed his last two radio conferences with them.  Since he left the United States in June, he would communicate every three days with his family using a satellite radio, but he hasn’t called for the last eight days.  Australian authorities have taken the American man’s disappearance very seriously and asked neighboring countries for help in finding him.  A spokesman of the Australian Coast Guard says they fear he may have gotten lost or even capsized, and could rapidly die of hypothermia.  They believe his ship has traveled at least 400 nautical miles south of Australia before it encountered problems, but they have very little information concerning his actual position.  The United States, New Zealand, the Philippines and Indonesia have also sent ships and helicopters to help in the search and rescue mission, allocating a total of 13 ships and 7 helicopters.  Despite all the resources allocated to saving him, many experts say it would be a miracle if he was found alive.  Mr. Walters has spent the last few months sailing on the Pacific an Indian Ocean aboard a small, specially designed boat.

TAIWANESE MILLIONAIRE SUCCESSFULLY GETS TRANSPLANTED 12-INCH-LONG BLACK MAN’S PENIS ,"Cape Town | A Taiwanese millionaire has just fulfilled one of his lifelong dreams after a successful penis transplant from a South African organ donor. Huy Xen Phang, a Taiwanese businessman who made his fortune in the real estate industry, had been waiting for 18 months before a suitable donor was found.  The penis transplantation is not only the fourth such surgery performed in the world but also the biggest known to date because of the enormous size of the penis in question.  “I am very proud of my big new penis, I don’t care if people know about it, it will only make them jealous,” Phang told reporters hours after the operation.  “My wife always tease me about my tiny penis, now she will have big black cock,” he said laughingly. “My penis was very, very small, like most Asian people. Now I will have biggest black dick in all of Taiwan and China,” he added with pride.  Dr. Andre van der Merwe of the Tygerberg Hospital admits he is very proud of the successful transplant but that it took a long time to find a suitable donor.

High requirements Dr. Andre van der Merwe of the Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, admits it took 18 months until a suitable donor was found.  “Usually we do transplants from dead bodies to living bodies but in this case, the donor is still alive,” he told the Cape Town Herald.  “Mr. Phang was very specific the penis needed to be over 12 inches long, not an inch shorter,” he explained. “We ran ads in national newspapers and finally found a number of suitable matches for Mr. Phang with whom he arranged a financial agreement,” he added.  A risky procedure Dr. Andre van der Merwe also warns that the procedure is expensive and not for everyone.  “There are many risks involved, such as rejection of the organ by the body or surgical complications,” he admits.  “There is also a period of adaptation, most people are not used to carrying such a heavy load,” he laughs.  “It is also recommended with a penis of this size to be careful during the first erections. One might become light-headed or even lose consciousness because of the blood transfer from the brain to the groin,” he adds.

Mr. Gordon’s lawyer, Ben Tillerman, says his client suffers from serious mental problems and has demanded a psychiatric evaluation to determine if he is fit to stand a trial.  The evaluation will take place as soon as the police investigation is completed and should take a few days, which means Mr. Gordon should make his first appearance in court next week.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
CHINA: FERTILITY CLINIC ACCUSED OF INSEMINATING WOMEN WITH PIG SEMEN ,"ix employees of a fertility clinic in the city of Lanzhou, in the Northwestern Chinese province of Gansu, received sentences ranging from 8  to 25 years in prison after they were found guilty of using pig semen to fertilize dozens of women. Between June 2016 and March 2017, a total of 86 women who had paid 50,000 yuán ($7,700) to be inseminated with sperm from “candidates carefully selected from the Chinese elite” were instead fertilized with swine semen.  Only 4 of these women actually got pregnant, and all of them miscarried before the end of their pregnancies.  Deformed fetuses One of these aborted fetuses was so deformed a doctor who saw it demanded an autopsy, and it was revealed that the embryo was part human and part animal.  A police investigation then led to the discovery of an unusual fraud involving the Rhinoceros Horn Fertility Clinic and six of its employees.  They discovered that the clinic was purchasing pig semen from farmers in a nearby village and using it to fertilize its customers.  Dozens of refigerated containers containing animal semen were found in the clinic during the police intervention.  During the investigation of the clinic’s dozens of refrigerated containers, the scientific police discovered over 80 samples of pig semen.  The animal semen was labeled was labeled as “platinum quality” and, surprisingly, sold at a higher price than “regular quality” human semen.  Six employees of the clinic were arrested in March and all of them were found guilty yesterday by the Lanzhou state court.  Exemplary sentences The director of the clinic, Mr. Wong Hu Chan, was sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for his responsibility in the fraud.  He admitted in his testimony that he had planned this unusual scheme in order to cope with the constant shortages of “high-quality semen”, which is hard to find in China.  The clinic’s two doctors were respectively sentenced to 15 years and 20 in prison, while two of the nurses were sentenced to ten years and one to eight years.  Four other employees of the clinic had first been suspected, but the investigation showed that they were not aware of the scheme.

DRUNK EMPLOYEE ARRESTED AT CERN AFTER CAUSING 3.2 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE ,"Geneva | One of CERN’s top scientists has been arrested after “highly dangerous operations” were conducted under his authority at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider based in Geneva. Russian physicist Alexandreï Ziouganov has been accused of “breaking CERN security rules” by “attempting highly risky and dangerous maneuvers” after he urged technicians to push the giant 27 km long particle accelerator to its limits, avoiding potential warning signs given by his coworkers while intoxicated by alcohol and under heavy medication.  The operation is believed to have caused an earthquake of 3.2 magnitude on the Richter scale, comparable to the impact of a large lightning bolt, assess experts.  « No serious damage was dealt to the Large Hadron Collider but several hyper-capacitors were damaged during the tests » – CERN spokesman, Olaf Gaardsteen  cern drunk test Under the supervision of the physicist, the LHC successfully collided two proton beams with 7.5 TeV of energy per proton, resulting in a record-breaking 13 TeV collision which is believed to have caused a 3.2 magnitude earthquake in the region  A history of recklessness The Russian physicist known for his bold character has been an outspoken CERN critic since he joined the team of international scientists nearly 5 years ago.  “He is a man of extremes” explains his coworker, Romanian physicist Yuri Malania. “He is possibly one of the 100 most brilliant minds in the world, but his character is like that of an erupting volcano. He wants everything to go faster, he strongly believes we are decades backward in science. He wishes humanity would already be colonizing Mars and the Moon, he wishes to leave his mark and push the limits of science into the 21st century,” he adds.  In a 2013 interview with Russian science magazine атомный, the physicist known for his outspokenness said that CERN scientists “were a bunch of wimps”, “incapable of understanding the importance of this technology” and that “they would never understand his genius”.  Creating a black hole The controversial physicist is also known for his obsession with dark matter and black holes.  “His dream is clearly to recreate a black hole within the LHC” explains French science journalist, Jeanne Legrand.  “He has always been a strong supporter within the European scientific community of increasing the capacities of the LHC and is at the origin of the highly controversial proposition of the LHCx, a process which would accelerate particles at speeds a thousand times faster, although most scientists do not approve of such tests for the moment,” she explains.  Last year his controversial views and statements on the LHC provoked a wave of hysteria after POPE FRANCIS warned such tests could “have disastrous consequences for humanity” and could “open the gates of Hell”.",TECHNOLOGY,Fake
WOMAN DEVELOPS IQ OF 220 AFTER DRINKING SPERM EVERYDAY FOR A YEAR ,"A student from UCLA has just achieved the highest score in history on an IQ test designed by Mensa, and she claims her astonishing result is due to her daily ingestion of sperm. 26-year old Alicia Franklin, was already a member of the high IQ society Mensa, after scoring 154 in her qualification test in September 2015.  The young woman searched for ways to improve her intelligence, and after taking a new test three weeks ago, it seems that she succeeded.  She allegedly raised her IQ by more than 65 points in 13 months, after she began ingesting a daily dose of fresh sperm. Her new results show that her cognitive intelligence, her perception, and her memory have all greatly improved.  According to her latest supervised test, her IQ is now evaluated at 220, making her smarter than Stephen Hawkins, Albert Einstein, and Leonardo Da Vinci, and placing her among the most intelligent people in human history.  “I did a lot of research on ways to improve my intelligence, and I found out that drinking sperm was probably the simplest and most efficient of them all,” she told Science Today. “There are many nutrients and chemical elements in it that are extremely important for the development of the brain.” According to Ms. Franklin, she started to notice the beneficial effects less than two weeks after she started ingesting semen.  mensapres The Chair of Mensa International, Bibiána Balanyi, says that Ms. Franklin could now be one of the three most intelligent people in history.  According to experts, Ms. Franklin’s theory is, indeed, founded on scientific facts, and it is very plausible to believe that people ingesting sperm could develop better intellectual capacities.  Semen contains over 200 proteins and several helpful vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, calcium, chlorine, citric acid, fructose, lactic acid, magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, vitamin B12, and zinc.  It also contains mood-enhancing compounds such as cortisol, estrone, oxytocin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, prolactin, melatonin, and serotonin.  Many of these elements could help get a better sleep, feel less stress and be in a better mood, which are all factors which may help to perform better.  ",TECHNOLOGY,Fake

TEAM OF SAUDI FORENSIC SCIENTISTS CONCLUDES DEATH OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI WAS A SUICIDE ,"A team of Saudi crime scene investigators and forensic scientists sent to the Istanbul Consulate have concluded that the cause of death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s was “most likely a suicide.” The Saudi government, which has taken a more proactive role in the case by conducting its own investigation after first denying the death of the journalist, said it will punish those involved.  The body of Jamal Khashoggi which was found last week in a back alley dumpster behind the Istanbul Consulate showed multiple wounds to the head, several broken ribs, crushed limbs as well as lacerations to the face and throat.  “All evidence gathered shows that Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of a suicide and died of self-inflicted wounds,” one Saudi specialist told reporters.   International skepticism has intensified since Saudi Arabia said on Saturday that Khashoggi, who had criticized the crown prince in his writing, died in a brawl. Yet Saudi officials now conclude the cause of death is most likely a suicide.  “We are grateful the truth surrounding this saddening death has finally been revealed and the International community can now focus its attention onto other matters of importance in the world,” one Saudi official said, visibly satisfied with the investigation. An interrogation of Khashoggi’s family members and friends by Saudi authorities revealed the journalist, who had planned to get married in the upcoming weeks, suffered from symptoms of “paranoid schizophrenia, depression and homosexual thoughts.”  One eyewitness told Saudi investigators how Khashoggi first got into a brawl with consulate employees and locked himself in a bathroom.  Saudi crime scene investigators concluded that Khashoggi violently threw his face against the walls, mirrors, and porcelain of the bathroom before attempting to drown himself in the toilet bowl by sustaining his head under water for several minutes at a time.  He then slashed his own face, head and throat with a rusty razor blade found on the scene of the suicide and during a violent schizophrenic episode threw himself from the window of the second story building of the Istanbul Consulate.  Experts believe he survived the two-story fall and dragged himself onto the back alley street of the Istanbul Consulate where he was accidentally driven over multiple times by a vehicle, as shown by multiple broken ribs and his crushed skull.  Khashoggi was then able to crawl into a back alley dumpster before bleeding to his death and was pronounced dead several hours later.  Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that he was « satisfied with the results of the investigation », that he was « glad that this controversy is now over » and that « the kingdom has redeemed itself in the face of the world once again.»",POLITICS,Fake
FORMER RUSSIAN SPY CLAIMS HE KILLED “THE REAL DONALD TRUMP” IN 2006 ,"A man claiming he was a professional assassin for the Russian secret services says he killed the “real Donald Trump” in 2006 and that Moscow replaced him with a look-alike. 59-year Vladimir Petrovitch Volchenkov left his home in St-Petersburg in May to seek asylum in France, arguing that his life was in danger if he remained in Russia.  He claims he spent 41 years working for the KGB and its successor the FSB and admits to killing over 180 people for the Russian state.  Mr. Volchenkov says most of those victims were Russians perceived as threats by the Kremlin, but at least a dozen were influential foreigners.  On his list, one name definitely stands out among the others: the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.  Mr. Volchenkov claims he killed Mr. Trump after an event in Prague in 2006, insisting that the man acting as president is an impostor.  “I would do as ordered, no matter who the target was. I didn’t know who Mr. Trump was when I was ordered to kill him. I just did what I had to do.” He says he strangled the billionaire in his hotel room and that the FSB immediately replaced the billionaire with a look-alike.  “The secret services do that all the time. Some agents undergo facial surgery to look like certain people, who are then eliminated and replaced.” Vladimir Volchenkov claims he only saw Mr. Trump as a businessman at the time and had no idea that the Kremlin intended to get their agent elected President.   When asked about the claims during a press conference aboard Air Force One this morning, the president dismissed the claims as “lies and fake news”, adding “I’m the real me!”.  Mr. Volchenkov’s claims have generated a lot of reactions and conspiracy theories on the social media.

SAN DIEGO ZOO: RHINO HAS 96-HOUR-LONG ERECTION AFTER TEENAGERS FEED IT VIAGRA ,"San Diego, CA | A southern white rhino has been in full-blown erection for over 96 hours at the San Diego Zoo, Safari Park officials report. Arjuna, a thirteen-year-old male rhinoceros, caught zoo employees’ attention after sustaining an erection for more than several days.  The animals bright, huge and red genitals have become a popular sight and a visitor favorite since the word spread on social media.  “The number of visitors to the zoo has exploded in the past few days. They just can’t get enough of it!” a San Diego Zoo employee commented.   Many on social media have even taken to nickname the animal Rhino Jeremy, in reference to Ron Jeremy, a legendary pornographic film actor.  It is not known how long the young male rhinoceros will stay in erection, but surveillance camera footage showed what is believed to be an apple filled with Viagra pills being thrown at him by a group of teenagers.  The animal’s sexual appetite has also exploded confirm zoo employees who have recorded Arjuna and three female rhinos copulating an estimated 188 times in the past 96 hours. Veterinarian Helen Sue Fisher believes the amount of Viagra ingested should not give the animal on the endangered species list any long-term complications.  “For sure being horny 24 hours a day might get exhausting but a few days of rest and he’ll be fine,” she told reporters, visibly amused by the whole situation.  The San Diego Police Department has launched an official investigation into the matter but no suspects have been apprehended at the moment.",POLITICS,Fake

ARGENTINA: 128-YEAR-OLD MAN CLAIMS HE IS ADOLF HITLER ,"An elderly man from Salta in Argentina claims that he’s the infamous German dictator Adolf Hitler and that he spent the last 70 years in hiding. In an interview with the ultra-conservative newspaper El Patriota, the naturalized German immigrant explains that he arrived in the country in 1945 with a passport identifying him Herman Guntherberg.  He claims that his passport was a fake one produced by the Gestapo near the end of the war and that he’s actually the former Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler.  He says he’s decided to come out of hiding after the Israeli secret services officially abandoned their policy of pursuing former Nazi war criminals last year.  “I’ve been blamed for a lot of crimes that I’ve never committed. Because of that, I’ve had to spend more than half of my life hiding from Jews, so I’ve had my punishment already.” The elderly man claims he’s preparing to publish his autobiography in order the restore his public image.  “I’ve been depicted as a bad guy only because we lost the war. When people read my side of the story, it will change the way the perceive me.” He says his book will be written under the name Adolf Hitler and should be available in September.  Many people, including his wife of 55 years, Angela Martinez, believe that Herman Guntherberg isn’t really Adolf Hitler, but is simply suffering from dementia.  Ms. Martinez claims her husband never spoke about Hitler until approximately two years ago when he began showing signs of Alzheimer’s disease.  “Sometimes, he would forget who I was and where he was. He looked like he was in trance, and he would start talking about Jews and demons. Then he’d come back to normal.”  She believes her husband may possibly have been a Nazi and that he may feel guilty about his past, but she’s convinced he’s not Hitler.  oldhitler2 Mr. Gunterberg’s wife claims he’s not Adolf Hitler, only a senile old man who is beginning to lose his mind.  Even if the elderly man’s claim seem rather questionable, they have sparked an animated debate in Israel and in the American Jewish community concerning the future of surviving Nazi war criminals.  Mossad had proved its ambition and global reach in the past with the capture of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1960 in Argentina, but it has abandoned this mission over recent years.  The Wiesenthal Center, which is still trying to find and prosecute Nazi criminals, has publicly criticized Israel in March, saying the Jewish state was ‘barely cooperating’ to its mission.  More than 70 years after the end of World War 2, few states and institutions are still trying to find and prosecute the surviving Nazis and most of them will certainly die without ever being punished for their crimes.",POLITICS,Fake
BLACK LIVES MATTER LEADER EXPOSED AS WHITE MAN USING TANNING INJECTIONS ,"KALAMAZOO, MICHIGAN | An influential leader of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) activist movement resigned from his position this morning after it was revealed that he was, in fact, a Caucasian man pretending to be black. The Kalamazoo Herald revealed yesterday that the director of BLM for the state of Michigan, known as Jamal Brown, was actually 53-year old Maurice Clark, a Caucasian former bank manager from Detroit.  Mr. Clark apparently began using tan injections on himself in 2011, a few months after losing his job at the Bank of America.  When interviewed by the newspaper, his former neighbors revealed that he began behaving strangely at the time and using stereotypical “gangsta rap” expressions.  “He matched all the clichés. He was acting more African-American, than any African-American I’ve ever met.” Mr. Clark moved to Kalamazoo in January 2012 and assumed the identity of Jamal Brown.  In a matter of months, the dynamic and capable man was occupying important positions in various civil rights organizations across Michigan.  In 2013, he was one of the founders of the Kalamazoo chapter of Black Lives Matter and has gained much influence within the organization since that time.  BLM named Jamal Brown as general director for the state of Michigan in 2014 and he had played that role even since.  BlackLivesMatterLeader2 Local leaders of the Kalamazoo BLM chapter reacted to Mr.Clark/Brown’s resignation, saying it was a “personal decision” and that the movement did not ask him to quit.  The last few months had been quite hectic for the activist after some attacks on his legitimacy began to surface.  In December 2016, a first wave of rumors concerning his origins began to circulate on the social media, leading some reporters to investigate.  In April, the Kalamazoo Herald published a series of articles revealing the Jamal Brown was a fabricated identity and that he wasn’t who he pretended to be.  Finally, yesterday morning, the same newspaper revealed that it had discovered Mr. Brown’s true identity, publishing fourteen pages of documents to confirm its claim.  According to these documents, the activist used regular melatonin injections to keep his skin pigmentation dark and protect his fake identity.  The BLM leader didn’t deny the allegations and published a short message on Facebook in which he asks for forgiveness and resigns from his position.  “I always wanted to be black, so I used some tan injections to fit in. I’m sorry if I hurt anyone, but I just didn’t want to be white anymore.” Mr. Clark said he would not make any more comments on his resignation and has refused all demands for interviews.  Despite the apparent identity fraud, a spokesperson of Black Lives Matter said the organization held no grudge against its former leader and announced that it would not file any accusations against him.",POLITICS,Fake

In an exclusive interview with CNTV-4, Ivana Trumps claimed the American President is obsessed with the size of his genitals, and has already tested “every product on the market” in order to increase the size of his penis.  “When we were married, he would take 5 or 6 different types of drugs at the same time and he used his penis pump twice a day. He would also measure his dick every night to see if it had grown.” According to the former model and socialite, he even overdosed twice, in 1989 and 1991, after ingesting more than 300 penis enlargement pills in a day.  “He literally popped pills like candy. It made him sick and gave no results, but he kept taking more and more. It was one of the main reasons we got divorced.” She says the president still takes penis enlargement drugs, but has reduced and stabilized his consumption to approximately 45 to 60 pills a day.  trumpred According to his ex-wife, Trump’s reddish skin color is a sign of high blood pressure, caused by his consumption of penis enlargement drugs.

TRUMP SCIENCE ADVISOR DENIES APOLLO MOON LANDINGS EVER HAPPENED ,"Donald Trump’s newly appointed science and technology advisor, Yale University professor David Gelernter, has already attracted a barrage of criticism after making controversial statements this week during an exclusive interview with Science Today. The controversial computer scientist already known for his strong stance against the science behind global warming has openly and vehemently criticized the space policy of the Barack Obama administration and its goal to reach Mars in 2030.  “ How can we manage to organize a U.S.-crewed orbital Mars mission by the mid-2030s when we never even went to the moon? The idea is laughable, as was Obama’s administration, if I may add ” – Yale Professor David Gelernter “The Apollo moon landings are the biggest fraud in mankind’s history, even worse than all that global warming nonsense,” he added.  trump science2 Recently appointed science and technology advisor to Donald Trump, Yale University professor David Gelernter, in an exclusive interview with Science Today this week, claimed the Apollo moon landings never happened.  A voyage that never was This is not the first time the controversial professor has attacked the Apollo moon landings. In his 2012 book America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats) the author voices his concerns about the impossibility of space travel outside the Earth’s magnetic field.  “In the modern age, we have never been outside the Earth’s magnetic field. With the exception of the alleged 24 human beings who flew lunar flights in the Apollo program during the four-year period spanning 1968 through 1972, all human spaceflights have taken place in low Earth orbit (LEO) or below. Even the International Space Station conducts all its operations in LEO,” he explained in his book.  “Why is that? This is because orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation,” he wrote.  A dangerous belt of radiation The Yale professor also documented in his book how NASA was, and still is, aware of the impossibility of traveling beyond the Van Allen Belt, a highly charged radioactive belt that is part of the planet’s magnetic field.  “The Apollo missions were supposed to be the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners, but even today, NASA scientists admit they can’t get past the Van Allen Belts” he claims in his 2012 book.  “If NASA scientists honestly admit in 2012 that they still haven’t worked out how to properly shield the spacecraft from the radiation emitted from the Van Allen belts, how the hell did we send human beings into space covered in aluminum foil suits? At a particular time when the Solar activity was at its peak? The answer is simple: It just never happened,” he concluded on the matter.  Despite his controversial claims, David Gelernter is a world-renown and multiple award-winning computer scientist known for his contributions to parallel computation and his early prediction of the rise of the World Wide Web.  Time Magazine profiled Gelernter as one of the 100 most influential people of the 21st century in 2016, describing him as an “arch-genius.” The New York Times called him a computer science “rock star” and “one of the most brilliant and visionary computer scientists of our time.”",POLITICS,Fake
RUSSIAN HOOKER WHO HAD SEX WITH DONALD TRUMP MOCKS HIS “TINY PENIS” ,"A 22-year sex worker named Ivana Kamensky, claims she was one of the prostitutes who had sexual intercourse with Donald Trump in Moscow in 2011, adding that the American President had the smallest penis she had ever seen. In an interview with the Moscow Daily Herald, the young woman described in great details the night that she allegedly spent in Mr. Trump’s hotel room five years ago.  Ms. Kamensky claims she was hired by Donald Trump along with two of her friends to perform several degrading sex acts, like urinating on him and on each other.  She said that she had been shocked by the incredibly small size of his penis, and remembers laughing about it with the other two girls.  “Many parts of his body are too small, not only his hands,” she told the Moscow Daily Herald.  “I’ve slept with hundreds of men and I’ve seen some small penises, but he’s by far the smallest I’ve ever seen.” She described Mr.Trump’s genitals as being the size of a grape, barely one inch (2.5cm) long when fully erect.  “We were not surprised when he asked for some unusual stuff, because he was not physically equipped to engage in any kind of normal penetration.” Ms. Kamensky says she was paid $10,000 for her night with Mr. Trump, which is more than the average Russian worker earns in a year.  trumphooker According to Ivana Kamensky, Donald Trump paid $30,000 for one night with her and two other prostitutes in July 2011 and asked them to perform many perverted sex acts.  Ms. Kamensky’s claims seem to confirm the unverified allegations about Mr. Trump being caught on film with prostitutes in both Moscow and St Petersburg, causing a scandal already dubbed as the “Golden Shower Gate” by some media.  The scandal finds its origin in a 35-page dossier compiled by a former MI6 agent, containing unverified allegations that Russian security officials have compromising material on Mr. Trump that could be used to blackmail him.  According to the dossier, the Kremlin had been feeding Trump some compromising information on his opponents for years. It had also acquired compromising information on Trump himself that could be used as blackmail.  There are allegations of “perverted” sex acts and also of frequent contact between Trump’s campaign and Russian government intermediaries.  Mr. Trump angrily denied the claims made in the dossier during his first press conference as president-elect.  He described the allegations as “fake news” and openly criticized the media who had covered the story.  Considering Mr. Trump’s tendency to react personally to most critics on his Twitter account, it is quite probable that he will react to Ms. Kamensky’s claims over the next few days.",POLITICS,Fake

They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover.

Alyssa Gilmore claims that her mother, a former secretary of the oval office named Whitney Gilmore, had an affair with President Clinton between 1998 and 2001. She says she was born out of that relationship and demands that Mr. Clinton undergoes a paternity test to prove that her story is true.  “I know Bill Clinton is my father,” says the young girl. “I have many pictures of my mother and him and I know they were in love.

RUSSIA: LAST WW2 GERMAN PRISONER FINALLY RELEASED FROM GULAG ,"Yenisey | The Russian prison authorities surprised the international community this morning by announcing that they would finally set free on Friday the last German prisoner of war from the Second World War. 84-year old Reinhard Kunze, was only 14 years old when he was captured by Soviet troops during the Battle of Berlin, in January 1945, and was detained for the last 69 years in various Soviet and Russian forced labor camps.  The Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergueï Lavrov, announced this morning that in an “act of good will”, the Moscow government was ready to “put aside their national pride” and show their “generosity and good will” by letting him go home.  Recruited in the Hitler’s youth (Hitlerjugend ) 12th SS Panzer Division in 1943 when he was 12 years old, Mr. Kunze was accused by Soviet authorities of executing  Yakov Dzhugashvili, the son of Joseph Stalin, at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in April 1943.  The son of the dictator had been captured during the Battle of Stalingrad and was killed after his father refused to exchange him for the German Field Marshall Friedrich Von Paulus, who had been captured by Soviet troops.  The Russian leader had however decreed that no matter when the other German POWs were to be released, the murderer of his son was to remain in forced labor camps until his death, to pay for his act of “exceptional cowardice”. Until now, the successive Russian governments had maintained the sentence and realized Stalin’s wish, even if it had no real legal legitimacy under modern democratic standards.  The actual government, however, seems to have changed its mind in order to appease the tension with Germany, that has developed over the conflict in Ukraine.  Many experts doubt however that this surprising announce could really have the desired effect, as it also constitutes an admittance that Russian authorities had detained illegally a German Citizen for 70 years, who moreover was only 14 years old at the time of his imprisonment.  This surprising news brings back painful memories to many Germans, has Mr. Kunze is only that last of a never-ending list of horrible stories linked to the end of the Second World War.  Approximately three million German prisoners of war were captured by the Soviet Union during World War II, most of them during the great advances of the Red Army in the last year of the war.  The POWs were employed as forced labor in the Soviet wartime economy and postwar reconstruction. By 1950 almost all had been released.  Officially, the last surviving German Prisoners of war returned home from the USSR in 1956, but it is now clear that it was not exactly true.  According to Soviet records, 381,067 German Wehrmacht POW died in NKVD camps over that time period, out of which 356,700 were German nationals and 24,367 from other nations. Many scholars and historians dispute those numbers, however, suggesting that the body count could be close to 1 million.",POLITICS,Fake
MAN CLAIMING TO HAVE BEEN VLADIMIR PUTIN’S LOVER KILLED IN ZURICH ,"Zurich | Iouri Michaelevitch, a former personal assistant of the Russian President, was found dead last Monday in his Swiss apartment after some of the neighbors complained about the smell emanating from the residence. According to the city’s police department, many clues collected on the site suggest that he might have been the victim of an elaborate murder plot.  “The police forces have only been able to proceed to preliminary analysis before we spotted a source of radiations on the scene and had to call a decontamination team” explains Sven Munger of the Zurich Police Department.  “We can confirm that the radioactive agent is a very rare Russian product named TCDD Dioxin. The clues we have collected are insufficient to pronounce a definitive conclusion, but the complexity of the of plot we have exposed greatly reduces the number of suspects.”  The victim had attracted a lot of attention from the Russian government and media in 2011 when he had written a book entitled “Я был любовник Путина” (“I was Putin’s Lover“), which was taken off the shelves before the official release, after a presidential decree.  A warrant demanding the arrest of the author was also issued across Russia, leading him to file a demand for political asylum from the Helvetic state.  Many sources also claim that Mr. Michaelevitch had dinner with an attaché of the Russian embassy five days before his body was found, a case strangely similar to that of the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko in 1999.",POLITICS,Fake
THAILAND: SNAKEGIRL ATTRACTS CROWDS OF PILGRIMS AND TOURISTS ,"Bangkok | 8-year-old Mai Li Fay, from Bangkok, is far from living the usual life of a girl her age. Every day, thousands of people gather to the front of her family’s house to get a chance of seeing and possibly touching the young girl, a gesture which both Buddhists and Hindu pilgrims seem to perceive as a guarantee of good fortune.  According to the country’s top medical expert, Dr. Ping Lao, the young girl suffers a very rare syndrome known as the Serpentosis Malianorcis or Jing Jing’s disease, which gives her lower body a distinct reptilian form and aspect.  Only a handful of such cases have been recorded throughout history, so the scientific knowledge accumulated about the pathology is rather limited and there is no cure in sight at the moment.  The Fay family have welcomed the situation brought by Mai Li’s situation with a mix of anguish and excitement, as the never-ending lines of tourists and pilgrims have brought the badly impoverished family some substantial revenues and given them an important rise in their social status but cost them there privacy and intimacy.",POLITICS,Fake

Google wants developers to add dark themes to save battery life ,"here are many different reasons why a big chunk of our readers loves dark themes. They’re more aesthetically pleasing, they’re easier on the eyes, and when done right, and under the right conditions, they might even save some battery. These are just a handful of reasons why dark Substratum themes populate the Play Store—as most apps out there keep chasing an all-white look, a dark UI becomes the better, friendlier option, and Substratum allows you to go for a dark look on every one of your apps. More recently, Google has also started to take a friendly approach to dark themes.  As you may be already aware, Google has recently started introducing dark modes on several of their apps, most notably including Messages and YouTube, a move that has been applauded by many power users and regular consumers alike. Now, they seem to be actively advocating for developers to introduce dark modes on their apps, too.  At the 2018 Android Dev Summit, Google took the stage to talk a bit about what developers can do with their apps to save battery on the end user’s phone. One of their solutions was to implement a dark UI. According to Google’s research, colors displayed on the screen can affect the phone’s battery draw, and a night mode (either dark gray or AMOLED black) can go a long way to save battery. Some of Google’s findings include:  Brightness affects power usage, and battery life, in a mostly linear fashion. A dark theme can reduce battery usage, even with max brightness, by up to 63% on AMOLED displays. Pixel color value can also affect power usage quite a bit, with white being the most power-hungry color.      Some of Google’s findings regarding the importance of a dark UI. Image credits: SlashGear  Google also admitted their past mistake of advocating for all-white interfaces for several years with their official Material Design specifications. While all-white interfaces may look better to some, a dark mode is friendlier to your battery, your screen, and your eyes.  Given Google’s new stance on this topic, we should get to see more dark Google apps in the coming months—and maybe, finally, a full-fledged system-wide dark mode for Android which applies everywhere. If you’re a developer, then it would be a good idea to work on a dark mode for your app, at least as a toggle.  ",TECHNOLOGY,Real

 Limiting social media use reduced loneliness and depression in new experiment Devin Coldewey@techcrunch / 16 hours ago ,"The idea that social media can be harmful to our mental and emotional well-being is not a new one, but little has been done by researchers to directly measure the effect; surveys and correlative studies are at best suggestive. A new experimental study out of Penn State, however, directly links more social media use to worse emotional states, and less use to better.  To be clear on the terminology here, a simple survey might ask people to self-report that using Instagram  makes them feel bad. A correlative study would, for example, find that people who report more social media use are more likely to also experience depression. An experimental study compares the results from an experimental group with their behavior systematically modified, and a control group that’s allowed to do whatever they want.  This study, led by Melissa Hunt at Penn State’s psychology department, is the latter — which despite intense interest in this field and phenomenon is quite rare. The researchers only identified two other experimental studies, both of which only addressed Facebook use.    One hundred and forty-three students from the school were monitored for three weeks after being assigned to either limit their social media use to about 10 minutes per app (Facebook,  Snapchat and Instagram) per day or continue using it as they normally would. They were monitored for a baseline before the experimental period and assessed weekly on a variety of standard tests for depression, social support and so on. Social media usage was monitored via the iOS battery use screen, which shows app use.  The results are clear. As the paper, published in the latest Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, puts it:  The limited use group showed significant reductions in loneliness and depression over three weeks compared to the control group. Both groups showed significant decreases in anxiety and fear of missing out over baseline, suggesting a benefit of increased self-monitoring.  Our findings strongly suggest that limiting social media use to approximately 30 minutes per day may lead to significant improvement in well-being.  It’s not the final word in this, however. Some scores did not see improvement, such as self-esteem and social support. And later follow-ups to see if feelings reverted or habit changes were less than temporary were limited because most of the subjects couldn’t be compelled to return. (Psychology, often summarized as “the study of undergraduates,” relies on student volunteers who have no reason to take part except for course credit, and once that’s given, they’re out.)  That said, it’s a straightforward causal link between limiting social media use and improving some aspects of emotional and social health. The exact nature of the link, however, is something at which Hunt could only speculate:  Some of the existing literature on social media suggests there’s an enormous amount of social comparison that happens. When you look at other people’s lives, particularly on Instagram, it’s easy to conclude that everyone else’s life is cooler or better than yours.  When you’re not busy getting sucked into clickbait social media, you’re actually spending more time on things that are more likely to make you feel better about your life.  The researchers acknowledge the limited nature of their study and suggest numerous directions for colleagues in the field to take it from here. A more diverse population, for instance, or including more social media platforms. Longer experimental times and comprehensive follow-ups well after the experiment would help, as well.  The 30-minute limit was chosen as a conveniently measurable one, but the team does not intend to say that it is by any means the “correct” amount. Perhaps half or twice as much time would yield similar or even better results, they suggest: “It may be that there is an optimal level of use (similar to a dose response curve) that could be determined.”  Until then, we can use common sense, Hunt suggested: “In general, I would say, put your phone down and be with the people in your life.”",TECHNOLOGY,Real
"Facebook debuts Lasso, a TikTok-style video app aimed at teens ","In an attempt to court the youths who have been fleeing from its flagship platform, Facebook has once again dipped into its bag of tricks and pulled out a TikTok clone. Lasso, a music-filled video sharing app that Facebook has reportedly been working on since October, is available now for iOS and Android.  Facebook describes Lasso as an app that ""makes it easy for anyone to create and share short videos with fun effects."" The app will allow users to follow other creators, search for content using hashtags and create new, short videos using a suite of creative tools. Facebook makes sure to note that the app includes a ""massive music library,"" which leverages it to take a shot at TikTok, an app that has gained popularity with lip sync videos.  Facebook Lasso  Because Lasso is owned by Facebook, it integrates into the company's ecosystem so you can sign in using an Instagram or Facebook account (or create one if you've managed to avoid the platform for this long). The app will need to access your profile page, photos and videos. When you make your own videos on Lasso, you'll be able to share them directly to your Facebook Story. A similar compatibility with Instagram stories is coming later this year, per The Verge.  You can get Lasso, which Facebook rolled out very quietly, starting today. The app already is filled with content, suggesting the app may have been able to a small group of community members before its public release.",TECHNOLOGY,Real

5 things to avoid in PUBG ,"PUBG or PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has become somewhat of a cult in the short span of almost two years of its existence. And it is one of the most intense actions games out there with solo as well as team fights that culminate in multiple people battling at the same time. While there are no hard and fast rules about what is considered good practice and bad, there are some set of unofficial facts that make it easier for the players to get that coveted Chicken Dinner.  So we are going to list out a few tips that are considered as effective measures in getting kills, being noticed less, and winning matches in PUBG.  Going unnoticed PUBG offers a lot of cosmetic options in the game that are colorful to say the least, and though these might look look on the characters it is not advisable to wear them in matches. This is because colorful outfits stick out in the terrain, and make you easier to spot for the enemies. So try and stick to clothes that make you less visible in the game.  Using single shot and burst fire Let’s admit it, using the auto mode for firing is great at close range, but it is ineffective in longer ranges and makes you miss the target. So when firing over longer distances, always try to use burst or single fire mode. But those that have mastered controlling the spray can use it over longer ranges.  Being silent PUBG is a game where sound is used by players to detect other players, so it only makes sense that the players themselves make less sound to give fewer hints to the enemy. Fire only when you have the full enemy team in sight and always be careful to watch the back in case other teams hear you and come to take part in the fight. This becomes crucial at the final few circles of the game.  Microsoft has made PUBG and Pro Evolution Soccer 2019 free on Xbox One Also Read Microsoft has made PUBG and Pro Evolution Soccer 2019 free on Xbox One  Avoiding vehicles Avoiding vehicles in PUBG is a good idea since they make you a more silent target and a smaller one. It does not take much for a team of four players to destroy a vehicle which makes them death machines. Sure they have their uses in covering those long distances, but sometimes it is just not worth it. Sanhok is one map where vehicles should be positively avoided since it is extremely small, and the likelihood of running into enemies is much more.  Being careful with Care Packages Care packages come with some great loot, but they are also shining beacon for other teams as well and it more than so happens that more than one teams try to get the same care package. And whichever team happens to reach it first, becomes an active target for the other enemies to fire upon. Hence caution is always good when dealing with Care Packages, the ideal play is to wait and pick off any team that tries to get the care package first and then going for it when the coast it clear.

"Amazon Signs Deal With Apple to Sell iPhones, iPads And Other Devices in India ","Amazon.com on Friday said it would carry more Apple Inc products globally in time for the holiday shopping season, as the technology rivals put aside past differences to boost sales. In coming weeks, the world's biggest online retailer will sell the latest editions of Apple's iPhone, iPad and other devices in the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Amazon sold a limited assortment from Apple previously that included Mac computers and Beats headphones.  The deal underscores how top brands such as Apple and Nike, which long resisted distributing products via Amazon, are increasingly turning to the e-commerce site because it has become a critical channel for reaching customers. Amazon has taken a harder line on counterfeit goods as well. As of Jan. 4, Amazon will rid its site of Apple products from third-party merchants not authorised by the Cupertino, California-based technology company. Still, shoppers will be able to find non-branded accessories - like headphones - that are compatible with Apple devices.  Third-party merchants will be allowed to sell as they have been through the holiday season, while Amazon will add Apple products to its official Apple at Amazon page. The lineup will include the Apple Watch but not the Apple HomePod, a high-end alternative to Amazon's voice-controlled Echo device. Such competition in Silicon Valley has often come at the expense of customers.  Alphabet Inc's Google pulled its video streaming app YouTube from two Amazon devices last year because of several complaints against the online retailer, including its decision not to sell some of Google's products. Amazon now carries the Apple TV, but only after it became compatible with Amazon's Prime Video. ""We’re working with Amazon to improve the experience for Apple customers on their site and we look forward to those customers having another great way to buy iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac and more,"" Apple said in a statement.  About 71 percent of Apple's sales in fiscal 2018, ended in September, were through indirect distribution channels like Amazon. ",TECHNOLOGY,Real
Manual Android backup to Google Drive option rolling out now,"Google Drive keeps tabs on a lot of your Android phone’s data like text messages, app data, contacts, and in some cases call history. However, there’s never been an option to manually back up your data.

ICC Women’s World T20: India vs Pakistan statistical preview ,"The sixth edition of the  Women’s World T20 has begun with aplomb. India captain Harmanpreet Kaur lit up the opening day with a scintillating hundred. However, India’s record in the tournament has not been eye-catching as they have reached the semis twice but could never progress beyond the first round in the succeeding tournaments. In this edition, teams have been divided into two groups of 5 teams each. England, South Africa, West Indies, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are in Group A. Group B comprises India, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan and Ireland. Only the top 2 teams from each group qualify for the semi-Finals.  With momentum on its side, the Indian eves look forward to improving their performance in the World T20 but one team will look to stop them in their path- arch-rivals Pakistan. The Indian women’s team will be overwhelming favourites against arch-rivals Pakistan in its second group league encounter of the ICC World T20 At Guyana on Sunday.  However, the last time these two sides met in T20 World Cup in 2016, India lost the match. However, since that loss in Delhi, India have played Pakistan thrice across two editions of Asia Cup, winning all the battles.  Interesting numbers also point out to that every time Harmanpreet Kaur has played in an Indo-Pak contest, the women in blue have emerged victorious. Former skipper Mithali Raj has a record of 2 wins and 2 losses.  In Women’s World T20 both the teams have met each other five times where India has won 3 and lost 2.  In Women’s T20 International, India have won eight times while Pakistan has won only twice. Thereby, India has a win percentage of 80 %.  Mithali Raj is the highest scorer with 259 runs. She is followed by Sana Mir who has hit 146 runs. Diana Baig has the best strike rate- 150  Among bowlers, Ekta Bisht has the most number of wickets- 10.

Few have called it immature, while others have labelled it disappointing.  However, former Indian fast bowler Zaheer Khan has backed the Indian captain and has said that both the fans and the player have equal freedom of speech and expression.  “Fans and Virat have equal freedom of speech. India is a democratic country and everybody has freedom of speech. Even the clarification Virat gave it came because he wanted to clearly state his feelings on the matter,” Zaheer told AajTak.

Windies seek small joys as chastening tour draws to a close ,"That Windies are returning home empty-handed from this full-fledged tour of India has been established. Therefore, it wasn't a complete surprise when the Caribbean Test specialists turned up at Chepauk for some red-ball practice even before the current T20I squad began their drills ahead of Chennai dead-rubber.  Barring opening spells that have grabbed eyeballs, nothing has gone Windies' way even in the shortest format on this tour. They ran into Dinesh Karthik version 2.0 in the series opener to concede the game despite having reduced India to 45/4 in a chase of 110. Then in Lucknow, a vintage Rohit Sharma show virtually rendered the contest over before Windies could begin their chase.  The lack of contributions from the experienced quartet of Carlos Brathwaite, Kieron Pollard, Denesh Ramdin and Darren Bravo has been at the heart of their batting meltdowns. The Windies are also without specialist openers - in the wake of Chris Gayle and Evin Lewis withdrawing from the series - and have had to make do with those at their disposal. They went in with the pair who had reasonable success in the preceding ODIs - Shai Hope and Shimron Hetmyer - but only managed marginally better returns than from the Hope-Ramdin combo.  The instability of the batting order is glaring. While skipper Brathwaite isn't too fussed about the criticism that comes with this hit-and-trial theory, he also didn't mince his words in putting the blame squarely on the batsmen for not applying themselves enough.  The captain also took the responsibility for their insipid bowling show in Game 2 that allowed India to race away to a near 200-run total. Brathwaite and Khary Pierre came in the firing line, leaking 105 runs between them in their eight overs alone. The bowling, overall has been guilty of failing to sustain the pressure even though pacer Oshane Thomas and all-rounder Fabian Allen have offered a glimpse into the potential of this young squad. However, Windies would need more than just intermittent sparks to avoid the embarrassment of a whitewash.  On an extended Diwali break since the series-clinching 71-run win in Lucknow, the Indians have released three usual suspects - Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah and Umesh Yadav - from their squad with an eye on the upcoming tour of Australia that also begins with T20Is. As such, the inconsequential final T20I has turned into a chance to test their reserves. With Shreyas Iyer waiting in the wings, Manish Pandey and Rishabh Pant would be feeling the heat in the batting department after failing to make their chances count.  Siddarth Kaul has been added to the mix but is unlikely to start, allowing for an additional spinner in Chennai. If Yuzvendra Chahal replaces Kuldeep, then India will have to choose between Washinton Sundar and Shahbaz Nadeem to complete the XI.  When: 3rd T20I, November 11, 7pm IST  Where: MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai  What to expect: If the lone IPL 2018 game at the Chepauk is any marker, the sun-baked center strip promises a typically high-scoring T20 run-fest to bring the series to a close. Clear skies predicted for the game night, though dew would impact decisions at toss.  Team News  India: With the series in the bag and after a much-deserved Diwali break, the hosts regrouped in Chennai only on the eve of the contest and stayed indoors. At least two changes to India's eleven are confirmed, but their only dilemma would be whether to back Pandey for another game or see what Shreyas Iyer has to offer after being waitlisted for the first two.  Probable XI: Rohit Sharma (C), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer/Manish Pandey, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Krunal Pandya, Washington Sundar/Shahbaz Nadeem, Yuzvendra Chahal, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Khaleel Ahmed  Windies: The resource crunch has led to a host of changes in the batting line-up for Windies, who are still figuring out players' roles. Expect that to continue till they hit jackpot. A maiden cap looks likely for hard-hitting Sherfane Rutherford as the visitors look to explore batting options beyond the misfiring candidates.  Probable XI: Shai Hope, Shimron Hetmyer, Denesh Ramdin (wk), Darren Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Carlos Brathwaite (C), Shefrane Rutherford, Fabian Allen, Keemo Paul, Oshane Thomas, Khary Pierre  What they said  ""I'm enjoying every moment of it. When I was young, I wanted to play for India. And here today also if I feel the pressure as well then I probably won't be able to [fulfil my potential]. Now that I'm living my dream, I want to be confident in my bowling and want to do well for India. And when you're doing well that in turn spurs you on to do even better."" Khaleel Ahmed, on dealing with the pressure of expectations  ""Pollard brings a lot, both on and off the field. With the youngsters in the squad, it's someone like Pollard who motivates them in the dressing room. He's a senior member of the squad, and we all know what he's capable of when he gets going... he's just a game away from reminding us why he's such a T20 force. Pollard himself would not be pleased with his show on the tour so far, and he'll be itching to finish the series in a blazing manner."" - Stuart Law on Pollard's no-show in the series thus far.",SPORTS,Real
"Uncapped Shaeen Afridi, Saad Ali named in Pakistan Test squad ","Shaheen Shah Afridi has earned a maiden Test call for the three-match Test series against New Zealand that begins next week. With him, Saad Ali is also included in the 15-member squad for the first two Tests. Fakhar Zaman and Shadab Khan are rested - to recover fully from their respective knee and groin niggles - and might rejoin the squad for the third match.  According to a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) statement that quoted chief selector Inzamam ul Haq, the decision to include Afridi was taken on the basis of his current form. Afridi has been on a roll in the ongoing ODI series against New Zealand bagging wickets at a phenomenal average of 10.5 runs. In the two contests at Abu Dhabi so far, the 18-year-old has picked up eight wickets. He made his ODI debut for Pakistan in the Asia Cup in September and since then he has taken the most wickets (12) amongst the Pakistani bowlers with the best bowling average and strike rate of 17.6 and 21.5 respectively.  He made headlines last year when he bagged the best figures for a debutant in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. He picked up 8 for 39 for Khan Research Laboratory against Rawalpindi in 15 overs.  Saad was rewarded for his brilliant 144 in the last of the two four-day matches against New Zealand 'A'. This is the second time the left-handed batsman has been called up to the Test squad this year. He was a part of the Pakistan squad that toured the United Kingdom for a solitary match against Ireland followed by a two-match series against England. The 25-year-old was the highest run scorer in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy last year as he plundered 957 runs at an average of 68.35 with three centuries and three half-centuries.  Despite a prolific Test debut, Zaman, along with Shadab, was not included in the Test squad. Though Shadab did not feature in Pakistan's recent Test series, Zaman played a crucial role with his 94 and 66 to stage a win over Australia in the Abu Dhabi Test, the last of the two-match series. A PCB spokesperson told Cricbuzz that the two have been given respective plans on which they will be working at the National Cricket Academy for two weeks, before adding that they might rejoin the squad for the third Test.  ""The team has been selected keeping in mind the conditions of the UAE,"" the statement said as it quoted Inzamam. ""Shahdab and Zaman have been rested from the Test matches and have also been advised to undergo training at the NCA. Afridi has been included in the squad keeping his current form. Saad included in the side after performing in domestic cricket and recent Pakistan 'A' series in the UAE.""  During their last tour of the UAE in 2014, New Zealand managed a series draw against a formidable Pakistan side that remained undefeated under Misbah ul Haq at their adopted home. They are one of the four sides - South Africa, Sri Lanka, and West Indies being the others - to have managed a Test win over Pakistan ever since the UAE became their adopted home.  The first Test gets underway from November 16 in Abu Dhabi followed by the second Test in Dubai from November 24. The teams return to Abu Dhabi for the third Test which starts on December 3.  Pakistan squad for the first two Tests: Mohammad Hafeez, Imam-ul-Haq, Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq, Haris Sohail, Babar Azam, Saad Ali, Sarfraz Ahmed (c & wk), Yasir Shah, Bilal Asif, Mohammad Abbas, Hasan Ali, Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Afridi, Mir Hamza",SPORTS,Real

All Blacks escape with win against England at Twickenham ,"CNN)The key to beating to the All Blacks is to believe you can beat the All Blacks.  Or as England coach Eddie Jones put it in the build up, ""We want to direct the movie, not just be in it.""  For 60 minutes England were in the directors' chair courtesy of tries from Chris Ashton and Dylan Hartley, and but for a disallowed try at the end may well have pulled it off. Jones' men were muscular, fired up, and clinical at times. The thunderous noise at Twickenham told you this was special. And they came so close. But New Zealand showed the poise and patience that has made them double world champions to escape with a 16-15 victory under the leaden skies of southwest London. With the World Cup less than a year away it was a significant result for both sides. For New Zealand, further cementing of its reputation as one of sport's most dominant winning machines, and proof perhaps that the recent defeat against South Africa was a blip. For England, shorn of a raft of key players through injury, another step in the right direction following last week's win against South Africa in the wake of a disappointing year. ""Sometimes the game loves you, sometimes it doesn't,"" said Jones, whose side got away with a controversial late decision which could have cost them the win against the Springboks.

Lewis Hamilton hints at Formula One exit if calendar expands further ,"CNN)The Formula One season is the longest it has ever been.  In 2018, for the second time in three years, drivers and teams have competed over the course of a 21-race season, spending more time away from families and homes.  Now, with the announcement of a Vietnamese Grand Prix being added to the calendar from 2020, Lewis Hamilton has expressed his concern that the season is becoming unbearably long. READ: Rain and conspiracy theories -- Reliving Lewis Hamilton's most dramatic F1 win READ: Hanoi to host new Formula One grand prix ""I am not going to be here if it gets to 25 races, that's for sure,"" Hamilton told reporters. ""It already feels like we are on race 25 this year, so I don't think that's a good thing. I think 18 was probably the best back in the day."" Despite next year also featuring 21 races, the schedule in 2019 means the F1 calendar will run into December for the first time in over 50 years. Play Video  Lewis Hamilton reflects on first world title 02:52 Liberty Media, the company that has owned Formula One since January 2017, has often expressed its hopes of expanding the season further. ""I'm someone who really loves racing but the season is long,"" Hamilton said. ""It's a lot of commitment for all of us and a lot of time away from families, and the seasons are getting longer and the off time is getting shorter. ""All I can do is speak is for myself. The turnaround is so short, you start preparing for your next season often as soon as the season is done. ""Getting your mind turned. That's very difficult. Then you have to find a way of switching off and recovering at the same time.""

Paris Saint-Germain at center of storm over racially profiling young players ,"It's one of Europe's biggest clubs and the dominant force in French football, but Paris Saint-Germain says the club's ""spirit and values were betrayed"" as its scouts illegally racially profiled young players during recruitment over a five-year period.  Backed by Qatari ownership, PSG released a statement after the French investigative website, Mediapart, published leaked documents on Thursday. CNN is unable to independently verify the documents.  Mediapart revealed that PSG detailed the ethnic origins of potential recruits, and that players were ""disregarded"" by the Parisian club on the grounds of being black. The Greater Paris area, particularly its diverse, sprawling suburbs, is arguably the most fertile breeding ground in the world for top-class footballing talent. In a statement released by PSG on its website, the Ligue 1 club said that the practice of racial profiling took place between 2013 and 2018 and that its management were not aware of it at the time. PSG said it was made aware of the racial profiling in October and that forms used by the department responsible for scouting outside the Parisian region ""contained an unacceptable identification field"" which listed the prospective player as French, North African, black African or West Indian. In France, authorities prohibit the collection of data on an individual's race, religion or ethnicity.",SPORTS,Real
Brazilian Grand Prix: Reliving Lewis Hamilton's first world title 10 years on ,"(CNN)Ten years ago, on a rain-soaked afternoon in São Paulo, Lewis Hamilton claimed the first of his five world titles to become the youngest Formula One champion in history.  In 2008, the Brazilian Grand Prix was the 18th and final race of the season and, in theory, should have been a victory procession for the Briton who needed only to finish fifth. It turned out to be anything but and is now remembered as an enthralling, nail-biting title decider. Play Video  Lewis Hamilton reflects on first world title 02:52 ""I just got a chill up my spine because it was an amazing experience,"" Hamilton later told CNN as he reflected on that first title win. A late tropical deluge delayed the start of the race and set the scene for an outcome so dramatic, even Hollywood's best script writers would have struggled to imagine it. From last-lap drama to internet conspiracy theories, it was the race that produced everything. ""Unquestionably the most dramatic (of Hamilton's wins), he didn't know he was world champion until the last quarter of a mile,"" F1 author Maurice Hamilton tells CNN. ""It was arguably one of the most dramatic finales to any world championship ... I can never remember one as dramatic as that. Up until the last lap you didn't know which way it was going to go. ""It's in the top two or three of the most amazing grands prix I've seen."" READ: Meet the next generation of F1 stars READ: The British teenager set to make F1 history Déjà vu? Hamilton boasted a seven-point lead over Ferrari's Felipe Massa heading into the race at Interlagos, but memories of the previous year's capitulation were very much still at the forefront of his mind. Just 12 months earlier, Hamilton again led the drivers' championship going into the final race -- four points ahead of McLaren teammate Fernando Alonso and seven ahead of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. After the McLaren pair almost took each other out on lap one, Hamilton went on to suffer car problems and the ""Iceman"" was able to snatch the title in his first season at Ferrari. ""The events in 2007 made him (Lewis) very nervous, no question,"" said Maurice Hamilton. ""They should have won that championship and because Hamilton and Alonso were at each others' throats, they finished joint second and Kimi came through the middle and took it. ""The team were very nervous. I'm sure it would have been playing on his mind, he did admit on the last lap he was a complete bag of nerves and driving on adrenaline."" Two torrential downpours tested the drivers to their limits. Two torrential downpours tested the drivers to their limits. In 2008, Massa qualified on pole with Hamilton fourth and the opening 63 laps passed largely without incident for the two main protagonists. As the skies cleared and the track dried, every driver in the field switched to dry tires. Hamilton bounced between fourth and fifth, both positions good enough to win him the title, while a faultless Massa led throughout. Just as it was looking like Hamilton would cruise through the final eight laps, black rainclouds again began to loom menacingly overhead. The rain was light at first, little more than a few spots, but just two laps later it was coming down hard enough to convince McLaren that Hamilton needed to pit for the wet-weather tires. By lap 66, every car had pitted to make the same changes -- except two. Toyota had decided to keep its two drivers, Timo Glock and Jarno Trulli, on dry tires and kept their fingers crossed the rain held off enough for them to not lose the time gained from choosing not to pit. The decision initially proved a success for Toyota as Glock rose from seventh to fourth and left Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel fighting it out for fifth. The young German -- at that time driving for Toro Rosso -- was all over the back of Hamilton's McLaren. READ: 'The best Lewis Hamilton I've seen in six years,' says Wolff READ: 'Remarkable' Lewis Hamilton joins pantheon of all-time F1 greats 'I only prayed' Lewis Hamilton crosses the line in fifth place to win the title. Lewis Hamilton crosses the line in fifth place to win the title. Seemingly out of nowhere, Polish driver Robert Kubica unlapped himself on the inside of the final turn on lap 68. Shaken by the surprise overtake, Hamilton took a wide path that allowed Sebastian Vettel past. All of a sudden, the 2008 world championship was in Massa's hands. ""Well I never give up, so I kept pushing,"" Lewis Hamilton told CNN soon after the race. ""Right until I got to the line and up until the second to last lap I was world champion pretty much. ""But it's never over until it's over and then I lost position. I only prayed that I could get it back and I couldn't catch this guy (Vettel) and I got to turn 10 of 12 on the last lap and I hadn't overtaken him."" On the final lap, with time and track rapidly running out, it seemed all of Hamilton's prayers were answered. The heavens opened, making is almost impossible for Glock to find any grip on dry tires. Out in front, almost 30 seconds ahead of the unfolding drama, Massa had taken the checkered flag with a flawless drive on home soil. His Ferrari garage celebrated wildly, as did tens of thousands of fans in the grandstand who thought they were celebrating the first Brazilian world champion since Ayrton Senna. But on the 71st and final lap, with the track now sodden after the torrential downpour, Glock had slowed so much both Vettel and Hamilton had been able to make up a 15-second deficit. ""He (Lewis) didn't know what was going on,"" Maurice Hamilton said. ""The team were shouting at him that he had to try and catch Glock and he didn't know what they were talking about. ""He had been trying to get past Vettel, that was his focus. All this is panning out in front of him and he's trying to keep the car on the road because it's wet."" With just one corner remaining, Hamilton edged his way past on the inside of Glock, who by this point was struggling to just keep the car on the track. ""I wasn't close enough to get him (Vettel) by turn 12,"" Lewis Hamilton recalled. ""It just so happened that it was wet, another guy was going very slow and I managed to get past him,"" he said, pausing briefly as if to relive that moment.  Conspiracy theories The realization of what had happened gradually permeated through a jubilant Ferrari garage, causing one mechanic -- in now infamous television scenes -- to smash his head against the wall in anger. As the sad reality finally set in for the team, the crowd and Massa's family, the McLaren garage spilled out onto the pit lane to celebrate with Hamilton. ""It was hugely dramatic and could have gone either way,"" Maurice Hamilton says. ""If the shower of rain had come a minute later, he wouldn't have been world champion, Massa would have won and he wouldn't have passed Timo Glock. ""It hinges on details like that ... there has been nothing like that since, even in his fights with (Nico) Rosberg and the others there's never been anything as dramatic as that. ""I don't think many world champions will tell you they had a finale like that."" In the immediate aftermath, a confused Glock swatted away questions in the mixed zone suggesting he had deliberately allowed Hamilton to pass. The pair had been friends coming through the ranks in GP2 and that only served to fuel conspiracy theories that Glock moved aside for Hamilton to win the title, though they are allegations the German has refuted on several occasions. ""It's all over us again ... it's 10 years ago and it seems it's bigger than ever. Lots, lots of Feedback ... at least not all negative,"" Glock posted on Instagram earlier this month. ""Still as a little reminder for those who still think I did it on purpose (still some out there) ... there is the on-board of the whole last lap on YouTube. At least you can see the difficulties I faced! Enjoy ....""  In what was undoubtedly the most brutal moment of his career, Massa remained gracious in defeat and earned universal praise for the way he conducted himself after the race. Tears filled his eyes as he stood atop the podium, proud but heartbroken. ""That was so impressive,"" Maurice Hamilton said. ""To think for about a minute that you're world champion at home with all that emotion, you've won the race and done everything you can. ""He drove a brilliant race, faultless and then to have that happen at the end -- he was very, very dignified. It was quite emotional on the podium, it must have been very, very tough to take. ""You don't often see that and it was a tremendous display of sportsmanship considering the terrible disappointment ... and of course he would never get his chance again."" Indeed that would be the closest Massa ever got to winning a world title and he retired from the sport in 2017, the same year Hamilton collected the fourth of his five championship wins. The 33-year-old has never been pushed so close in any of his subsequent victories, and fans may be left waiting a while longer to witness another grand prix as dramatic as Brazil 2008.",SPORTS,Real
Winx: Cracksman joins wonder mare as world's top-ranked race horse ,"She may have it all her own way on the racetrack, but Australian super mare Winx has been joined by Cracksman at the head of the Longines World's Best Racehorse Rankings.  Winx, who won a record fourth Cox Plate for a 29th straight win last month, and Ascot Champion Stakes winner Cracksman both rated 130 when the latest rankings were published Friday.

All Blacks and England to wear poppies in 'special' match ,"Their all black jerseys are recognizable the world over, but playing with a red poppy on the sleeve to honor those killed in war will be ""a special occasion,"" according to New Zealand rugby coach Steve Hansen.  The All Blacks and opponents England will both sport the iconic emblem of remembrance when they clash at Twickenham, London Saturday, a day before the centenary of Armistice Day signaling the end of World War I.  The wearing of poppies to commemorate the fallen has raised emotions in recent times, with Manchester United footballer Nemanja Matic refusing to wear one on his shirt last weekend because it reminded him of his childhood when the former Yugoslavia was bombed in a NATO-air campaign that lasted 78 days in 1999. But Hansen says the famous All Blacks will be wearing their poppies with pride. ""Any time you put the poppy on is a pretty special occasion marking one of the disastrous occasions, World War I and what happened then,"" he told reporters in the New Zealand team's hotel on the banks of London's River Thames Thursday. ""So many people from so many countries lost their lives and it changed families for ever, but they lost them trying to do what was right for their country and there were a lot of New Zealanders involved. ""Thirteen All Blacks from the original team died in World War 1, and the first ever captain was one of them."" There were also 27 Englishmen among the 131 international rugby players to have died in the war. When the players run out, they will pass the spot where soil from the Belgian grave of former captain Ronnie Poulton, who was killed in 1915, was buried at Twickenham in May.

New Zealand flyhalf Beauden Barrett will line up opposite Owen Farrell for England. The two sides have not met since New Zealand edged a close encounter 24-21 at Twickenham in 2014, but the world champion will take on a resurgent England side fresh off victory against South Africa last weekend. They will be playing for the Hillary Shield, named after Kiwi great Sir Edmund Hillary, who along with Sherpa Tenzing, was the first person to climb Mt. Everest in 1953. The name of Hillary, who died in 2008, has extra resonance for the All Blacks. ""Ed Hillary was one of the great men of New Zealand,"" added Hansen. ""He and Tenzing climbed that mountain for the first time, when New Zealand was unheralded, a place of farmers and colonials, so to speak. ""We were good at rugby and not getting a lot of credit for a lot of other stuff and he helped put New Zealand on the map. ""He did a tremendous amount of work in the Himalayas for people who were poorer off than maybe others were, so he's a tremendous man and it's a really great trophy to be playing for."" READ: Why are the All Blacks so good? The All Blacks will wear a poppy on their sleeves against England.  The All Blacks will wear a poppy on their sleeves against England. If Hillary put New Zealand on the map, the all-conquering All Blacks have made it the center of the universe when it comes to rugby. New Zealand has won the last two World Cups, has been the world's top-ranked side since 2009, and has won 23 of its last 27 Tests. Its only loss this year came in a 36-34 defeat against South Africa in Wellington, New Zealand in September, but as one of sport's most dominant winning machines, Hansen says the All Blacks are used to dealing with the expectation of a rugby-mad nation. ""The one constant thing about being in the All Blacks is you're under pressure constantly,"" said Hansen. ""You're expected to win every Test match and not only win it but win it really well. ""Once you come to realize that life becomes a little easier. [The pressure] is there, it's not going to go away. And it does, a lot of times, give you an advantage because when other teams get put under pressure they haven't experienced as much as maybe we have.""

""It's been there since day one for me,"" said flyhalf Beauden Barrett, who will be winning his 71st cap against England. ""We're used to it, we're expected to win every time we go out there, but we embrace it as a team and walk towards it as a team."" Winger Rieko Ioane, 21, added: ""The pressure we put on each other is probably bigger than what everyone perceives we get on the outside. ""That's probably what makes it easier to cope with. The management are real harsh on the boys and the boys are harsh on each other so it makes it a healthy competitive environment."" Hansen said players new to the set-up ""feel it straight away"" and admitted the All Blacks' world can be an ""overwhelming place,"" but stressed the key is to talk about it and help players cope with it in their own way. ""Once you've acknowledged it's there you can deal with it,"" he said. Natural athletes However, Saturday's clash has a bigger ""buzz"" than even when New Zealand hosted the British and Irish Lions in 2017, says Hansen. ""We understand who we are and our history, but you've got to be reasonably stupid if you can't work out this is going to be big,"" he adds. ""There will be 80,000 people, it' s all over the papers, you can't get a ticket -- you must have been on holiday if you can't work out it's going to be big.

Champions League: Is it time to sympathize with PSG's Neymar? ,"The memes of Neymar rolling in agony along high streets and motorways remain one of the enduring memories of a thrilling World Cup in Russia.  Spectacular goals and knee-knocking finishes admittedly made the footballing world smile during the summer, but so too did the #neymarchallenge on social media as fans, multinationals and even Portugal's 911 service mocked the Brazilian superstar's theatrics on the pitch.  According to Swiss broadcaster RTS, the world's most expensive player spent 14 minutes on the floor during football's most celebrated tournament. Many of those minutes would have been spent rolling around in apparent agony before getting back on his feet again to continue with the dribbles, flicks and no-look passes. Neymar has created 17 chances in the first four Champions League games of the season. Neymar has created 17 chances in the first four Champions League games of the season. But is Neymar more sinned against than sinning? Should the Paris Saint-Germain forward receive more protection from referees and less ridicule from the masses? According to beIN Sports data, during the opening rounds of this season's Champions League, the forward has been awarded 20 fouls -- 14 more than his teenage teammate Kylian Mbappe, who is equally adept at bamboozling defenders with trickery and pace, and 16 more than Liverpool's Mo Salah over the same number of games. READ: Neymar -- ridiculed for his theatrics Barcelona's Lionel Messi, who has played just twice in the Champions League this season, has won four fouls while Juventus' Cristiano Ronaldo has won seven over three games. If all players are treated equally, it is a striking statistic that Neymar has won considerably more fouls in Europe's elite competition than the world's other best forwards. Neymar has scored three goals in four Champions League games this season. Neymar has scored three goals in four Champions League games this season. Bought by the French champions in 2017 for $263 million, Neymar cut a frustrated figure in Italy Tuesday as Napoli fought back to draw 1-1 against a PSG side third in a group that also includes last season's finalist Liverpool. There is still much to do if the Parisians are to progress to the knockout stages. Undoubtedly, a man of Neymar's talents, a player who can change a game with a moment of brilliance, is a marked man. View image on Twitter View image on Twitter  OptaJoe ✔ @OptaJoe  11 - Neymar and Kylian Mbappe have created 11 goalscoring chances for one another in the Champions League this season; the most of any combination in the competition. Dynamic.  354 12:52 AM - Nov 7, 2018 108 people are talking about this Twitter Ads info and privacy It would be foolish for defenses to leave such a player to roam unattended. A sumptuous pass over Napoli's defense to Mbappe early in first half at the Stadio San Paolo illustrated the danger Neymar's creativity alone poses to opponents. He is also lethal in front of goal, scoring three in the opening four group games. Napoli wisely, though Neymar himself would probably say unfairly, paid close attention to the 26-year-old. Towards the end of the match, Neymar -- booked in stoppage time for dissent -- could be seen shouting at referee Bjorn Kuipers and appeared to be held back by Mbappe after taking issue with one of the referee's decisions. Neymar (C) argues with Netherlands&#39; referee Bjorn Kuipers. Neymar (C) argues with Netherlands' referee Bjorn Kuipers. The Brazilian would later accuse the Dutchman of saying something ""disrespectful"" to him during the match. ""On the pitch, we are asked to show respect towards the referees. We should get the same in return,"" he told reporters afterwards. There were those on social media who sympathized with the Brazilian. ""He often frustrates me by going down too easy (imo) -- but you can see why he does on a night like this when he tries to stay on his feet and gets absolutely nothing,"" tweeted journalist Robin Bairner. In another tweet, Barnier said: ""Frustrating night for #Neymar. He's been on the end of numerous niggling fouls, several not given, and yet he's been booked for dissent."" Perhaps some of Neymar's problems are of his own making. Against Switzerland at the World Cup, he was fouled 10 times -- the most by one player in a game since Alan Shearer in 1998 -- but his response to such tactics was to fall, many would say, too easily to the ground.

Floyd Mayweather distances himself from bout with Japanese kickboxer ,"Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. has denied that he agreed to fight Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa in a televised bout on New Year's Eve, saying that he and his team had been misled as to the conditions of the fight.  In a post on Instagram, the undefeated (50-0) fighter said that he had ""never agreed to an official bout"" with Nasukawa, and had in fact been approached about a short exhibition match for a ""small group of wealthy spectators."" Mayweather said he and his team had been ""completely derailed by the new direction"" of the event, as presented at a press event on Monday, after signing with Japanese promoters RIZIN Fighting Federation. He said that he regrets not correcting the record at the time. ""For the sake of the several fans and attendees that flew in from all parts of the world to attend this past press conference, I was hesitant to create a huge disturbance by combating what was being said and for that I am truly sorry,"" Mayweather said.  However, the boxer spoke to CNN in Tokyo after the fight was announced, and at the time he appeared to be on board with the plans, although he said he ""didn't like to call this a fight -- I like to call this a special event."" Mayweather told CNN Talk Asia's Anna Coren that it had ""always been"" one of his goals ""to go outside the US and compete as a professional in what I love to do."" At the time he said that the rules for the bout would be decided ""within the next couple of weeks,"" but said he was ""pretty sure it's going to be, you know, hand to hand combat, boxing, because I'm the A-side,"" meaning that his preference would be prioritized. Play Video  Mayweather: Nasukawa fight is a special event 01:39 In the Instagram post Mayweather said that the fight had been arranged as a ""special bout,"" which he said was ""purely for entertainment purposes with no intentions of being represented as an official fight card nor televised worldwide."" At the press conference in Roppongi Hills, Tokyo to announce the fight, the two fighters posed in front of a background advertising the date and venue of the planned fight, the Saitama Super Arena, a 37,000-capacity indoor venue 40 minutes north of Tokyo. Mayweather and Nasukawa pose during a press event in Tokyo to announce the fight.  Mayweather and Nasukawa pose during a press event in Tokyo to announce the fight. A spokeswoman for RIZIN told CNN that the company is ""currently confirming the facts of the situation,"" and will release a statement ""at some point later."" New Year's TV events are a huge part of the Japanese cultural landscape, and most Japanese broadcasters run special programming. Combat sports have long been a key element of the evening's TV entertainment and consistently receive high ratings. Mayweather's assumed participation had been a huge driver for RIZIN. 'I want to give the people what they want' At the press conference announcing the fight, the former five-weight world champion said that he had ""wanted to do something different."" ""I wanted to display my skills outside the US and be in a special fight. I want to give the people what they want -- blood, sweat and tears."" His opponent, the 20-year-old Nasukawa, said at the time that he was relishing the chance to fight the legend. ""It's the biggest moment in my life and I want to be the man who changes history. I'll do that with these fists, with one punch -- just watch."" Coming out of retirement -- again? While Mayweather is officially retired, there have been suggestions that the 41-year-old American would re-enter the ring. He's already come out of retirement once, to beat UFC star Conor McGregor in 2017, and had been linked to a money-fight with former foe Manny Pacquiao. The two met at a music festival in Tokyo earlier this year, with Mayweather seemingly announcing a fight would take place in December. UFC president Dana White has also suggested the boxer should face Russia's Khabib Nurmagomedov, who recently bested McGregor in the octagon. Mayweather has opened the door for a fight with Nurmagomedov -- but only if it's in the boxing ring. The fighter made it clear to CNN that the ball is in the Russian's court and admitted to previously meeting with the fighter's management. He urged Nurmagomedov to think about the rewards. ""If Khabib wants to fight in a boxing match, we can,"" he said. ""If he wants to go to UFC and make the money that he's been making, he can. ""When Khabib fought McGregor, he made $3-4 million. When you fight me you're going to make way more."" He denied that he will fight Pacquiao again, despite saying in September in Tokyo that there would be a rematch. ""Well, different days we feel different ways,"" he told CNN.",SPORTS,Real
How do you beat the All Blacks? ,"Few teams -- from any sport, any era, or any country -- have a record that can match that of the All Blacks.  Since lifting the World Cup on home soil in 2011, New Zealand's rugby team has boasted a win percentage close to 90%. Its reign as the world No. 1 ranked side goes back nine years, and it comes as no surprise that Steve Hansen's men have been hotly tipped to win a third consecutive World Cup in Japan next year.  When it comes to the depth of players at their disposal, not to mention the skill set and athleticism those players bring to the field, it's little surprise the All Blacks have been rugby's dominant force for the best part of the past decade. But that's not to say they're unbeatable. Teams working out how to beat the All Blacks -- which include England and Ireland in the coming weeks -- will look to South Africa's performances in the Rugby Championship for inspiration. ""You have to take your hat off to South Africa,"" former New Zealand captain Sean Fitzpatrick tells CNN after the Springboks came close to recording rare back-to-back victories over the All Blacks. ""The intensity they played with -- we haven't seen that intensity for a long time. Their will and their fitness levels looked very good."" READ: Why are the All Blacks so good? Play Video  Dan Carter on Japanese rugby and New Zealand 03:10 South Africa's victory in Wellington was only New Zealand's second defeat on home soil since 2009. Is there a secret to toppling the All Blacks? ""The teams that take the All Blacks on are the teams that are successful normally,"" continues Fitzpatrick, who won 92 caps for New Zealand in the 1980s and 90s including 51 as captain. ""The problem is you've got to do it for 80/85 minutes and there aren't many teams at the moment that can live with the All Blacks for that long. ""Don't be afraid -- South Africa showed that. Their aggression levels were very high. They were very physical, they didn't miss tackles, they took their opportunities."" New Zealand let in 132 points in the recent Rugby Championship -- the most it has ever conceded in the tournament. The somewhat porous defense is something that didn't pass Fitzpatrick by. ""We're fans who want to be entertained and the All Blacks play a very entertaining style of rugby which sometimes -- as you saw during the Rugby Championship -- can leak tries. That's one area they're probably looking to sure up.""

Florida recounts expected to begin as tensions escalate across state ,"State election officials are expected to announce on Saturday afternoon that the razor-thin races for governor, senator and agriculture commissioner will be reviewed in a series of automatically-triggered recounts.  Republican Gov. Rick Scott is ahead of incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by about 15,000 votes, giving him a lead of less than .25%. The margin in the governor's race is larger, with Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis leading Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by about .4%, or nearly 36,000 votes. Those numbers could change by around noon on Saturday, when the unofficial counts are due. If the current margins stay under .5% in any of the three statewide contests, then votes in those races will be recounted by machine. That recount must be finished by Thursday at 3 pm ET, at which point the state can order a hand recount of overvotes and undervotes in any race within .25%. An overvote means a voter selected more than the allotted options on the ballot; an undervote means a vote selected fewer than the available choices or, in these races, none. The Senate race and the contest for agriculture commissioner currently fall within the .25% margin. FloridaSenateest. 99% in candidate votes % Scott 4,098,107  50.1% Nelson 4,085,545  49.9% FloridaGovernorest. 99% in candidate votes % DeSantis 4,075,869  49.6% Gillum 4,042,176  49.2% Detailed updates on the state of the race have been hard to come by, leading Scott to successfully sue top election officials in Broward and Palm Beach Counties for details on the total votes cast and how many of them had been canvassed. In Broward, Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes turned over information to Scott and his team for review late Friday. But before midnight, the campaign pushed out a new press release claiming Snipes had not fully complied with the court order ""because she refuses to confirm whether or not additional ballots exist that must be counted."" Adding to Broward County's troubles, a CNN analysis of votes cast there suggests that ballot design could be responsible for a substantial difference in the number of votes cast between the race for governor and the race for senator in Florida. There is also lingering drama in Palm Beach County, where Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher missed a similar deadline entirely. She has asked for an emergency hearing. Earlier in the day, Bucher had been ordered by a judge to find and produce ballots she and her staff had invalidated without consulting a canvassing board. She now has until noon to comply. While the politicians tweeted and activists announced new protests this weekend, demonstrators on the streets outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office targeted Snipes, chanting ""lock her up"" and ""fake votes don't count"" as she and others worked inside trying to finish the initial vote count. ""Make America Great Again"" and ""Trump 2020"" signs and hats were also visible as a group carrying signs supporting Scott and DeSantis were met by another backing the Democrats, as nose-to-nose screaming matches nearly escalated into physical altercations. Scott escalated already rising tensions across the state on Thursday night, when in a news conference he took a page from President Donald Trump and, without citing any evidence, accused ""left-wing activists in Broward County"" of trying to steal the election for Nelson. The county, in deep-blue portion of South Florida, is notoriously slow in counting its votes and as its tally mounted, Scott's lead had predictably diminished. In a series of tweets on Friday, Trump picked up the thread and accused the Democrats of attempting ""Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties."" But Scott's request for an investigation into election-related fraud did not go far. On Friday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it was told by the Department of State, which is run by a Republican Scott-appointee, that they had received ""no allegation of criminal activity."" Still, Scott's campaign issued an ominous-sounding statement on Saturday morning ""encouraging every Florida Sheriff to watch for any violations and take appropriate action."" Meanwhile, Nelson's campaign filed suit against the state over its process for validating vote-by-mail ballots. Democratic lawyer Marc Elias, who is running the Nelson recount effort, argued that Florida's signature matching process put an undue onus on the ""untrained opinions"" of poll workers, which led to a ""complete lack of uniformity"" in how the ballots were being judged. ""This serves as an outright disenfranchisement and burden on the right to vote,"" Elias told reporters on a call Friday. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has also injected himself into the fight, alleging -- like Scott and the President, with no proof -- that there are ""shenanigans going on in Broward and Palm Beach"" before suggesting in another tweet that a sinister cabal of liberals from Washington was at work trying to rig the election. In fact, out-of-state lawyers from both parties, including a handful who had significant roles 18 years ago, have been flocking to Florida ahead of the recount. Around the state on Friday, allegations and rumors of misplaced or lost votes fueled simmering anger and confusion as the campaigns, lawyers, operatives and freelance rabble-rousers girded themselves for a re-run of the pitched partisan combat that took over the state during the 2000 presidential recount. Outside a mail distribution center in Miami-Dade County, a group of activists with images they said showed undelivered ballots inside tried and failed to get a meeting with a supervisor. Later in the day, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Postal Service said it was ""researching the matter to verify that all ballots have been handled in accordance to USPS service standards.""",POLITICS,Real
Brett Kavanaugh tries to shun the spotlight he can't avoid ,"The last time most Americans saw Brett Kavanaugh, he was on national television testifying before senators, emotional, angry and insistent that Democratic partisans were trying to destroy him with allegations of sexual assault from decades ago.  Kavanaugh: This is a national disgrace  Kavanaugh: This is a national disgrace 02:51 Now, as President Donald Trump continues to hold up Kavanaugh as a political trophy, the new Supreme Court justice himself is trying to lower his profile. For his formal investiture at the Supreme Court on Thursday, he did not appear for any photographs by the news media and skipped a traditional photo op on the marble steps where the public could have seen -- and protested -- him. (The court cited security concerns.) Kavanaugh also seems inclined against a prominent role at next week's annual meeting of the Federalist Society, the group working with the White House to confirm conservative judges, to which Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first appointee, gave a rousing keynote speech last year. Within the court, Kavanaugh has deferred to his colleagues in oral arguments and quickly adhered to the court's institutional traditions. The other justices have gone out of their way to be publicly welcoming and have shown an unusual degree of collegiality all around during arguments so far this term, even laughing more at one another's jokes. Trump gets another chance to celebrate Kavanaugh at court ceremony Trump gets another chance to celebrate Kavanaugh at court ceremony In the few cases he has handled so far, Kavanaugh has declined some opportunities to favor the Trump administration, separating himself from Gorsuch in early votes. He has aligned more with Chief Justice John Roberts than the far right of the bench. All told, Kavanaugh appears to be lying low after the volatile confirmation process and buttressing Roberts' efforts to move the court away from the white-hot media spotlight. Yet Kavanaugh, a political insider who spent 12 years on a US appeals court, also understands that the media scrutiny will fade. The record of Kavanaugh, 53 and appointed for life, will become clear only over many months and years. For the law in America, the newest of the nine represents only part of a momentous change underway. For years as the justices met privately to decide cases in a rich oak-paneled conference room, the person whose views mattered most was Justice Anthony Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded. A conservative with centrist tendencies on social issues -- including abortion, race and gay rights -- Kennedy was regularly the deciding vote. Like the lawyers who stood at the lectern and publicly argued before the high court, individual justices often tailored their arguments around the private conference table to Kennedy.  Not one of the current nine has a similar centrist approach. Justices on both sides of the ideological divide are watching Kavanaugh for any clues about how to best approach the new justice. Kavanaugh was carefully vetted by a Trump team that did not want a vacillating jurist in the mode of Kennedy. Gorsuch has fulfilled those expectations, often partnering on the far right with Justice Clarence Thomas for an originalist approach to the law, tied to the Constitution's 18th-century origins. Gorsuch's emergence in the public eye last year, however, was fraught. Some of his moves spurning court practices miffed his colleagues, who made their displeasure known. He also garnered unusual attention on social media, including among law professors, for statements and writing that critics found inflated and self-important. Kavanaugh's style is different and he appears to be trying to make good on his oft-repeated confirmation mantra about ""always being a team player on the team of nine."" Trump invokes Kavanaugh to rally base in Montana Trump invokes Kavanaugh to rally base in Montana Where Gorsuch immediately opted against having his clerks join the clerk pool that collectively screens petitions for certiorari, seeking review of cases lost in lower courts, Kavanaugh has had his clerks join. (All justices but Gorsuch and Samuel Alito are in the so-called cert pool, which dates to the 1970s.) In the private conference, the junior justice has the responsibility of taking notes on the proceedings and answering the door if any aide knocks to offer a document or even a fetched set of forgotten reading glasses or a coffee cup requested by a justice. That person is now Kavanaugh. He will also be last in line to cast his vote. In tight cases, he likely would be the fifth conservative, sealing a victory for the right wing. Or he may prove unpredictable, perhaps even defying his benefactor. Before this week's midterm elections, as Trump tried to rally Republicans, he constantly invoked Kavanaugh's appointment and the Democratic opposition he faced. The day after the election, the President boasted that the Kavanaugh strategy paid off. ""By expanding our Senate majority, the voters have also clearly rebuked the Senate Democrats for their handling of the Kavanaugh hearings,"" Trump said at a White House news conference. ""Tremendous energy was given to the Republican Party by the way they treated then-Judge Kavanaugh, now Justice Kavanaugh,"" he said. Voter: Kavanaugh hearing was &#39;embarrassing&#39;  Voter: Kavanaugh hearing was 'embarrassing' 05:29 Playing nice in public Kavanaugh's response to the sexual assault allegations of Christine Blasey Ford prompted some lawyers and judges, including retired Justice John Paul Stevens, to question his temperament and ability to be an impartial jurist. Former Justice John Paul Stevens suggests Kavanaugh should not sit on Supreme Court  Former Justice John Paul Stevens suggests Kavanaugh should not sit on Supreme Court During the Senate hearing, Kavanaugh described Ford's claims as part of ""a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election ... revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups."" Individual justices are conflicted over how Kavanaugh's confirmation unfolded, yet all have an incentive to be collegial and forward-looking. They have projected a ""business as usual"" image, even appearing to be getting along better on the bench. Kavanaugh has now sat through three weeks of oral arguments. He has held back and let his colleagues air their queries before jumping in. He also has tried to take opportunities to question both sides in fractious cases, perhaps to avoid being labeled with a predictably conservative approach. Fellow justices have shown regard for his questioning, occasionally picking up on his line of inquiry. ""What the treaty seems to prevent,"" Justice Elena Kagan observed to a lawyer at the lectern in one case, ""is the state from taking either travel or, as Justice Kavanaugh says, travel with goods."" At another point, Kagan, who sits next to Kavanaugh on the bench, said, ""I think the import of Justice Kavanaugh's question is that in the usual case. ... "" In a separate dispute, after Kavanaugh had tried to enter the fray but was interrupted, Roberts stopped the lawyer at the lectern. ""I think Justice Kavanaugh had a question,"" Roberts said, ensuring Kavanaugh an opening. Later in the same argument, Kavanaugh said, ""to pick up on the chief justice's comments. ... "" Play Video  Chief Justice: We speak for the Constitution 02:02 Staying close to the chief justice While they are united in public, with Kennedy's departure the court is more divided on the substance of the law, split between five conservatives (Roberts, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito and Clarence Thomas) and four liberals (Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Kagan). Yet the chief justice has been determined to show that the court is above politics. Roberts may end up inching to the left himself in some cases, to avoid some 5-4 splits, and may find a new ally in Kavanaugh. John Roberts touts collegiality, but Supreme Court&#39;s record suggests otherwise John Roberts touts collegiality, but Supreme Court's record suggests otherwise How those justices on the right band together -- or not -- could make a difference in the cases the court takes up and the fate of long-standing precedents, for example on abortion rights. Where Kavanaugh falls on the ideological spectrum could also affect larger constitutional dilemmas, provoked by Trump's demonstrated disregard for legal norms. Kavanaugh and Roberts, a decade older at 63, have known each other for nearly 30 years. Both served in the US Solicitor General's Office during the George H.W. Bush administration, Roberts as a deputy SG and Kavanaugh on a fellowship for young lawyers. During the George W. Bush administration, Kavanaugh obtained top legal jobs and Roberts won court appointments, first to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in 2003, and then to the Supreme Court, in 2005. Kavanaugh himself then served on the DC Circuit, reinforcing their common path. They have long had a friendly relationship. Last month, when Kavanaugh underwent a ceremonial investiture at the White House, following his 50-48 confirmation vote by the Senate, he went out of his way to praise Roberts. ""Chief Justice Roberts is a principled, independent and inspiring leader for the American judiciary,"" Kavanaugh said. ""As a country, we are fortunate to have John Roberts as chief justice of the United States."" Roberts returned the favorable comments when he spoke of judicial independence, after referring to ""the contentious events in Washington,"" at the University of Minnesota the following week. Exclusive club: Harvard, Yale and former clerks dominate Supreme Court Exclusive club: Harvard, Yale and former clerks dominate Supreme Court ""As our newest colleague put it, we do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we do not caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest. We serve one nation,"" Roberts said. Not siding with Trump -- yet The 2018-19 session, which began a week before Kavanaugh was seated last month, is still so new that he and most justices have yet to issue any written opinions. But Kavanaugh has taken actions that separate him from the conservative stalwarts. In late October, when the court took up a challenge to the Commerce Department's addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census, Kavanaugh was with the majority in allowing lower court proceedings to continue and testimony to be taken from a key Justice Department lawyer in the dispute, while his fellow conservatives Gorsuch and Thomas dissented. (Separately, the full court blocked the challengers from obtaining testimony from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.) How Kavanaugh maneuvered to win his confirmation fight How Kavanaugh maneuvered to win his confirmation fight A week later, on November 2, the court by a 6-3 vote rejected a subsequent administration request to postpone the trial. Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch publicly dissented, but Kavanaugh, who may have been predicted to join them, did not. That same day, the Supreme Court -- again over public dissents from Thomas and Gorsuch -- rejected a Trump administration request to block a lawsuit by youths who want to hold the government responsible for emissions policy and climate change. RELATED: Supreme Court won't block children's climate change lawsuit In none of those three matters did Kavanaugh write anything that became public. Trump had no public comment on any of them, either. The President still speaks enthusiastically of his new nominee and suggests he believes the high court will be more on his side. When a federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a decision that blocked the administration from ending an Obama-era program shielding undocumented immigrants who came to the United States when young from deportation, Trump said he would be happy to take the case to the nine. Appeals court says administration can&#39;t end DACA, Trump says it sets up Supreme Court fight Appeals court says administration can't end DACA, Trump says it sets up Supreme Court fight ""We want to be in the Supreme Court on DACA,"" Trump told reporters Friday morning, later adding, ""where we'll be given a fair decision."" And earlier in the week, before Tuesday's elections, the President raised Kavanaugh's name to rally campaign crowds. He cast Kavanaugh as a victim of false accusers and their Democratic enablers.

"Trump, Macron gloss over differences in France after rough start ","US President Donald Trump began his 48-hour visit to Paris on Saturday meeting with his host, French President Emmanuel Macron, a onetime friend who he chided on Twitter within minutes of landing in the French capital.  The men worked to paper over their differences during a morning meeting. But the effusive expressions of bonhomie that once colored their interactions were gone, replaced by businesslike handshakes and wooden declarations of cooperation.

At the start of the meeting, the pair seemed to gloss over whatever differences they may have on European military cooperation, saying they were aligned on burden sharing. ""We're getting along from the standpoint of fairness, and I want to be fair. We want to help Europe, but it has to be fair,"" Trump said. ""Right now, the burden sharing has been largely on the United States as the President will say and he understands that. He understands the United States can only do so much."" Macron said his ""proposals for European defense are consistent"" with Trump's views. Later, a French presidential spokesman said Macron was able to clear up the ""misunderstanding"" about his views on Europe's defense policy during his meeting with Trump. ""I think this was a very good opportunity at least for the French President to clarify exactly what he meant, and at the end of today's talks they stated that they had reached agreement on this whole question of the vision of the transatlantic alliance and European security,"" the spokesman told journalists. The reason for Trump's visit Play Video  Trump spars with Macron as he arrives in France 02:28 The morning meeting precedes the real reason for Trump's visit: marking the 100th anniversary of the World War I armistice, which will bring leaders from across Europe to the Arc de Triomphe on Sunday for a solemn ceremony. Trump was also due to mark to the centenary with visits to burial grounds for some of the 117,000 American military personnel who died in the war. On Saturday, he was meant to visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, near where the Battle of Belleau Wood was fought in 1918, though the 50-mile journey was canceled because of foul weather. His chief of staff John Kelly lay a wreath there instead. He will deliver remarks from Suresnes American Cemetery on Sunday -- Veterans Day in the United States. ""Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war, in particular that one, which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time?"" Trump tweeted on Saturday morning.  Donald J.

But differences on trade, climate change and the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal have soured their ties. The tweet only underscored Trump's willingness to blow up his global friendships if he believes it better serves the United States or his own agenda. He has taken similarly assertive stances against leaders in the United Kingdom and at NATO hours before sitting for talks. On Tuesday, Macron called for a ""real European army"" during a tour of the former Western Front, according to AFP. ""We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,"" Macron said, according to the French press agency. Macron also suggested that since the start of Trump's presidency, the US has been seen as a less reliable ally. ""When I see President Trump announcing that he's quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its security,"" he said. Macron has been advocating a similar position for months. Trump's Friday tweet could preview another high-level international meeting in which the US President distances himself from traditional American allies. Unlike the tense G7 summit in June, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be present at this weekend's commemoration. Evolving relationship Play Video  How the Macron-Trump bromance evolved 01:51 While both Trump and Macron appeared to be off to a warm start following Trump's inauguration, their relationship appears to have soured. During a call about trade and migration in June, sources familiar with the call told CNN that it didn't end well. ""Just bad. It was terrible,"" a source told CNN. ""Macron thought he would be able to speak his mind, based on the relationship. But Trump can't handle being criticized like that."" And more recently, a senior diplomatic source told CNN that Trump was ""ranting and venting on trade"" with Macron during their bilateral meeting in September. There was ""some rapport"" between the two, ""but it's not what it (once) was,"" the source said. His meeting with Macron at the Élysée Palace on Saturday morning is the only meeting with another world leader on his schedule, though more informal encounters are possible at the Armistice ceremony and a subsequent lunch on Sunday. Other leaders attending including Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Theresa May. US officials said the civil war in Syria and efforts to counter Iran would sit high on Trump and Macron's agenda. And trade -- one of Trump's signature issues when he visits with foreign leaders -- was also likely to arise.  During Macron's visit to Washington last spring for the first -- and still the only -- formal state visit, Macron lobbied the President to remain in the nuclear accord, including over an intimate dinner of dover sole at George Washington's Mount Vernon estate. But it wasn't enough to keep Trump from announcing within weeks that he was pulling out. Since then, Macron has issued warnings against nationalism and protectionism, even as Trump fully embraced those sentiments during a dark and angry midterm election campaign. Both men find themselves politically humbled. Trump's Republican Party lost control of the House of Representatives during the midterm vote, and ongoing vote counts have given an edge to additional Democratic candidates. Macron, meanwhile, is sinking to new lows in polls, weighed down by unpopular reform efforts and an attitude that some French regard as aloof. Once viewed as the next center of European power as Merkel exits the stage, Macron now is fighting just to regain his standing at home. One part of Macron's efforts was convening the Paris Peace Forum this week, intended to bring world leaders together in the goal of promoting peace just as the deadly events of 100 years ago are top of mind. But Trump is skipping the forum, deliver his own address on Sunday afternoon before flying Air Force One back home.

"Video Shows NYPD Officer Punching, Tasing Handcuffed Disabled Man ","President Donald Trump picked a fight with French President Emmanuel Macron over European defense just as Air Force One landed in France on Friday.  ""President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly,"" Trump tweeted minutes after landing in France. He is set to spend the weekend in Paris to commemorate the centennial of the end of World War I. Tuesday on Europe 1 radio, Macron called for a ""real European army"" within the European Union, according to AFP. ""We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,"" Macron said. Macron also suggested that since the start of Trump's presidency, the US has been seen as a less reliable ally. ""When I see President Trump announcing that he's quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its security,"" he said. Macron has been advocating a similar position for months. A senior French official said Friday night that Trump took Macron's words out ""out of context."" According to the official, Macron will likely want to respond to Trump's tweet directly himself, and likely Saturday. The official, though, clarified the language Macron used, saying that the French leader did not mean he wanted a European army but better coordination and funding of Europe's already-existing resources. The official said that Macron was conveying that Europe should organize better to protect itself. There is already a European defense project, and Macron would like to see more capability, the official said. ""Not a European army. He did not mean Europe should form an army,"" the official said. ""And this is all complementary to NATO, not separate from it."" Further strain in Trump-Macron relationship Trump's tweet on Friday could preview another high-level international meeting in which the US President distances himself from traditional American allies. Unlike the tense G7 summit in June, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be present at this weekend's commemoration. While both Trump and Macron appeared to be off to a warm start following Trump's inauguration, their relationship appears to have soured. During a call about trade and migration in June, sources familiar with the call told CNN that it didn't end well. Trump jets to Paris, leaving political tumult behind Trump jets to Paris, leaving political tumult behind ""Just bad. It was terrible,"" a source told CNN. ""Macron thought he would be able to speak his mind, based on the relationship. But Trump can't handle being criticized like that."" And more recently, a senior diplomatic source told CNN that Trump was ""ranting and venting on trade"" with Macron during their bilateral meeting in September. There was ""some rapport"" between the two, ""but it's not what it (once) was,"" the source said. Macron isn't the only European leader to raise the prospect of Europe doing more for its own defense. EU President Donald Tusk made a similar suggestion in May after Trump had pulled out of the Iran deal and the Paris climate agreement, threatened a series of trade disputes with Europe and constantly criticized NATO. ""Europe must do everything in its power to protect, in spite of today's mood, the transatlantic bond. But at the same time we must be prepared for those scenarios, where we will have to act on our own,"" Tusk said. Tusk also said that the EU ""should be grateful"" to Trump ""because, thanks to him, we have got rid of all illusions."" ""Looking at the latest decisions of President Trump, someone could even think: With friends like that, who needs enemies?"" Tusk said, later adding, ""He has made us realize that if you need a helping hand, you will find one at the end of your arm."" Trump's tweet on Friday continues his oft-repeated misunderstanding of the way NATO works. The President has consistently complained that NATO members don't adequately contribute to the shared defense agreement, suggesting the other 28 members somehow owe the US money. Actually, all alliance members commit to spending 2% of their GDP on defense. While few have reached that threshold, most members have increased spending in recent years and are nearing the suggested level of spending.

Democrats are in. Sessions is out. Here's what that means for immigration ,"Two major developments this week stand to change the conversation when it comes to US immigration policy.  Democrats gained control of the House in Tuesday's midterm elections. The next day, President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- a key architect of many of the administration's hard-line policies. Here's how things could play out going forward: There's new hope for a DACA deal. Courts have blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protected so-called Dreamers from deportation. But advocates stress that's a temporary victory for those young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children -- especially since the Supreme Court might take up the matter. The bottom line, according to advocates: Lawmakers need to do something. Appeals court says administration can&#39;t end DACA, Trump says it sets up Supreme Court fight Appeals court says administration can't end DACA, Trump says it sets up Supreme Court fight Yes, we've heard this plenty of times before, only to see negotiations fizzle or lawmakers fail to find common ground. But Democratic control of the House gives a new jolt to the push for a legislative solution on DACA. And to efforts to protect other immigrant communities. ""It gives us an opening for us to stop the administration and hold the administration accountable,"" said Cristina Jiménez, executive director of the immigrant rights group United We Dream. ""And it creates an opportunity for us to be proactive about policy reforms that will protect immigrant communities from deportation and will keep families together and provide a pathway to citizenship."" But reaching a deal is still harder than it sounds. Several moderate Republicans who had been pushing for a DACA compromise lost their re-election bids this week. McConnell expresses little appetite for tackling immigration McConnell expresses little appetite for tackling immigration Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed little appetite for tackling immigration when he spoke with reporters this week. And the Trump administration has signaled it's going to keep pushing its immigration agenda. ""They're continuing to use every tool in the toolbox,"" said Tyler Moran, director of The Immigration Hub, which advocates for progressive immigration policies. ""They're not slowing down on immigration. They're speeding up."" Trump will still wield power when it comes to enforcement. The Trump administration entered a new rule into the federal register this week that would block migrants from applying for asylum outside of official ports of entry. Like imposing a travel ban, ending DACA or slashing Temporary Protected Status (TPS), this new effort is already facing legal challenges. But the asylum rule is another clear example of what the administration has shown time and again: It will take action on immigration, with or without Congress on board. Controversial policies will face more scrutiny. Some of the administration's most controversial immigration policy moves are going to face a new wave of scrutiny in a Democratic-controlled House, where lawmakers have vowed to increase oversight hearings. That means we could learn many more previously undisclosed details behind family separations, the administration's decisions to end DACA and TPS and officials' decision to add a citizenship question to the census. But Democrats don't control the House yet. And before they do, there's a budget showdown on the horizon in December. Republicans warn: There&#39;s a &#39;big fight&#39; brewing over Trump&#39;s border wall  Republicans warn: There's a 'big fight' brewing over Trump's border wall A continuing resolution passed in September effectively tabled a contentious border wall funding fight. But Congress now faces a December 7 deadline to avert a government shutdown, and will have to vote on a spending bill that includes border wall funding. That's not the only controversial immigration measure that could come up for debate. Another area likely to face pushback from some Democrats: requests for increased funding for immigrant detention beds. ""They're still not in control as we head into this negotiation,"" Moran said. ""Next year, you're going to have more muscle and more fight on that issue."" Trump's next attorney general pick could have a big impact on where things go from here. While Trump repeatedly chided Sessions publicly, the former attorney general was an effective emissary helping to conceive and carry out many of the administration's hardline efforts. As the Trump administration quietly rewrote immigration policy, Sessions led the charge. He reinterpreted asylum law, set quotas for immigration judges and served as a prominent face for the administration's zero-tolerance policy -- which resulted in thousands of family separations at the border -- and for its decision to end DACA. Sessions defends Trump on immigration policy  Sessions defends Trump on immigration policy 00:55 Groups that favor increased immigration restrictions frequently praised his performance. There's little doubt that whoever Trump picks to fill Sessions' shoes will have a similar mission and ideology. But there's a key unanswered question: Will the next attorney general be as effective as Sessions was at pulling the right levers behind the scenes? Some are already expressing their doubts. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates restricting immigration, noted that even with a Republican-controlled Congress, no immigration measures were passed. And that will continue for the next two years, he said on Twitter. ""But with Sessions gone,"" he wrote, ""not much of note will get done administratively either.""",POLITICS,Real
Rosenstein calls Whitaker a 'superb' choice for acting attorney general ,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Friday hailed acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker as a ""superb"" choice to fill the role even as Whitaker's past statements have prompted questions about his impartiality toward special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.  ""I think he's a superb choice for attorney general,"" Rosenstein told a small group of reporters gathered outside of an investiture ceremony for US Attorney Zachary Terwilliger in Alexandria, Virginia. ""He certainly understands the work, understands the priorities of the department."" RELATED: Sessions replacement Matthew Whitaker called Mueller's appointment 'ridiculous' and 'a little fishy' The positive tone from the No. 2 official at the Justice Department was notable, as Rosenstein and Whitaker have had a complicated relationship for some time, compounded by the fact that Whitaker had discussed taking Rosenstein's job with President Donald Trump several weeks ago. Despite that, Rosenstein, who has weathered the President's bad side at times and attacks from some of Trump's most vocal Hill allies, has managed to survive, and he publicly praised Whitaker on Friday in a clear attempt at displaying department solidarity. Whitaker, who previously served as chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was vaulted to the position of acting attorney general on Wednesday after Trump fired Sessions. ""We are pleased to announce that Matthew G. Whitaker, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice, will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""He will serve our Country well."" Sessions &#39;confident&#39; Mueller probe will be handled &#39;appropriately&#39; Sessions 'confident' Mueller probe will be handled 'appropriately' ""We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date,"" he added. Since the announcement, Whitaker has faced criticism for his past comments on Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election -- an investigation he is expected to oversee as acting attorney general. What Sessions&#39; firing means for the Mueller investigation What Sessions' firing means for the Mueller investigation In 2017, Whitaker wrote a CNN op-ed that argued Mueller was ""dangerously close to crossing"" a red line following reports that the special counsel was looking into Trump's finances, and he called the special counsel's appointment ""ridiculous"" and ""a little fishy"" in a 2017 appearance on the ""Rose Unplugged"" radio program. Rosenstein added Friday that he had delivered his message of praise for Whitaker on Thursday in a conference call with federal prosecutors around the country: ""I think he's going to do a superb job as attorney general."" For nearly 18 months, Rosenstein has overseen the special counsel's investigation because Sessions had stepped aside from all matters related to the presidential campaign. When Whitaker leapfrogged over Rosenstein and was named acting attorney general, questions immediately began to swirl about who Mueller would report to, whether Whitaker must recuse himself from the investigation given his fierce criticism of it, whether Rosenstein would quit and whether Mueller's work will be curtailed. Whitaker has given no indication he believes he needs to step aside from ultimately overseeing Mueller's investigation, one person familiar with his thinking told CNN on Thursday. That belief is echoed by White House officials who also do not believe Whitaker needs to recuse himself, sources tell CNN. Rosenstein is expected to continue to handle the day-to-day management of the probe, as he would for any other significant criminal investigation. However, the arrangement may prove challenging down the line, or quickly, if Whitaker and Rosenstein disagree on any significant matter. As The Washington Post reported Thursday, people close to Whitaker do not believe he would approve Mueller seeking a subpoena of President Donald Trump.

WSJ: Draft indictment detailed Trump's role in hush money scheme ,"Federal prosecutors prepared a detailed 80-page indictment against Michael Cohen that outlined President Donald Trump's role in directing payments to women to keep quiet about alleged affairs, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.  Mueller&#39;s team defends his authority in court amid Justice Department shakeup Mueller's team defends his authority in court amid Justice Department shakeup The report adds new details to Cohen's comments in court when he pleaded guilty in August, in which he said the payments to the women were coordinated with Trump. Trump was involved in or briefed on nearly every step of the payments that were made to former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, to keep quiet about their alleged affairs with Trump, the Journal reported, and the US Attorney's office in Manhattan gathered information about Trump's participation. The transactions may have violated campaign finance laws. The 22-page document prosecutors ultimately filed against Cohen alleged that he coordinated with one or more members of the Trump campaign. In court, Cohen admitted that ""in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,"" he kept information that would have harmed Trump from becoming public during the 2016 election cycle. Prosecutors had prepared a draft indictment of Cohen that was more detailed and included additional charges, people familiar with the investigation have told CNN. The indictment was sent to the Justice Department in anticipation of charging Cohen, a person familiar the matter said. But negotiations between Cohen and prosecutors then began in earnest and they negotiated a plea deal. Prosecutors never filed the indictment and Cohen pleaded guilty to a court filing containing fewer charges. The Journal report adds new details about how Trump was involved. Trump says he has &#39;never used racist remarks&#39; Trump says he has 'never used racist remarks' Trump met in August 2015 at Trump Tower with David Pecker, the CEO of American Media, who offered to use the National Enquirer to buy the silence of women who might try to publicize sexual affairs with Trump, according to the Journal. The criminal filing from prosecutors described the meeting in vague terms, but didn't go into detail. During the campaign, Trump asked Pecker to stop McDougal from telling her story, and Pecker's company paid $150,000 to the former Playboy model. Then in October 2016, Cohen paid $130,000 to Daniels himself to keep her from going public about an affair with Trump. The President lawyers declined to comment. Trump has previously denied both affairs. Michael Avenatti, the lawyer representing Daniels, said the new developments vindicated his client. ""For over 8 months we have been battling Donald Trump and the lies he has told about his payment to my client. This is further vindication that we were right,"" Avenatti said. ""I think the President should be indicted,"" he added. American Media declined to comment on the report. CNN's Sara Sidner and Sonia Moghe contributed to this report.",POLITICS,Real
The four people who will determine the fate of Russia probe ,"Leading figures in the Russia drama face fateful choices in the coming days and months that could tip America into a political and constitutional abyss. With the midterm elections in the rearview, a sense of foreboding is settling over Washington.  The gravity and consequences of the investigation suddenly seem oppressive, with special counsel Robert Mueller writing his final report and an unchained President Donald Trump aggressively seeking to check him. New acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and the likely next House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, must quickly adapt to new circumstances and powers that have made them vital players at a critical moment of the intrigue. It is becoming increasingly clear, not least from Trump's raging mood, that the end game of the Russia saga will subject the mechanisms of the US government to extreme stress and test the nation's shattered cohesion. The President: Disrupt or stand pat  Trump pointed out in his post-election news conference on Wednesday that although he believes the Russia investigation is ""very bad for our country"" he has so far not shut it down. ""I could have ended it anytime I wanted. I didn't. And there was no collusion,"" he said. But there is speculation that he could use Whitaker as a tool to interfere with Mueller's probe or stifle its conclusions, or even to try to fire the special counsel. Any of those options could ignite a constitutional conflagration. Alternatively, Trump could choose to wait for the final report into allegations his campaign colluded with Russia in 2016 and he obstructed justice to cover it up. The President has already given an ominous glimpse of his intentions. Within hours of midterm polls closing, Trump ejected Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation. Trump installed Whitaker above Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has been giving cover to Mueller and his investigators while overseeing the probe. Some critics interpreted Trump's move as his latest bid to undermine the investigation or remove officials he sees as a threat, in what legal commentators are now calling a ""slow motion 'Saturday Night Massacre,' "" in reference to Watergate. There is a building debate over whether Trump's appointment of Whitaker might have been in itself an abuse of power. Still, there were signs on Thursday that there has been no disruption to oversight of the Mueller probe. Rosenstein's top deputy, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Ed O'Callaghan, met lawyers from the special counsel's team in a regular biweekly meeting, a source familiar with the matter told CNN's Laura Jarrett. The source explained that while Whitaker has ultimate oversight authority as the acting attorney general, the day-to-day running of the probe is still being handled by Rosenstein's office. ""It's business as usual,"" the source said. The President is on dangerous ground if he decides to pressure the investigation. If it later comes out that Trump by design put Whitaker in position to thwart the investigation, he could provide more evidence that he is guilty of a corrupt purpose to obstruct justice. ""That will send him down a path that for the next few years that would tie up his presidency in ways that are not in his best interests legally or politically,"" said Michael Zeldin, a former senior Justice Department official, with a touch of understatement on CNN International on Thursday. The new acting attorney general: Suddenly on the hot seat Play Video  Whitaker likes to talk about Mueller 02:08 CNN revealed on Thursday that Whitaker has publicly shot down the idea that Russian interfered in the 2016 election -- contradicting multiple Mueller indictments. Now, he is suddenly thrust into the most high-stakes legal, political showdown involving different branches of government since Watergate. He has the power to narrow the investigation and limit the budget for the special counsel's team. He could refuse requests by Mueller to request indictments or to subpoena testimony from the President. He could try to stifle publication of Mueller's final report or could try to keep it from Congress. Michael Conway, counsel for the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate, said that the most sinister threat to Mueller may be a quiet attempt to suppress his work by Whitaker out of sight of Congress or the public. ""The concern would be that behind the scenes, he would in a whole variety of ways thwart the investigation without the issue of a public firing, without the issue of a cataclysmic event that would generate immediate political backlash,"" said Conway, now a professor at the Medill School of Journalism. Democrats demanded Whitaker recuse himself over his previous criticism of Mueller -- a largely academic exercise since it's obvious his main attraction to Trump is that he is not prevented from overseeing the investigation. The first sign that Whitaker is acting against Mueller could come if there are no indictments in the weeks to come or signs of activity at the grand jury. If indictments follow, it could be a sign Whitaker stepped back. One interpretation of Trump's swift rejigging of the Justice Department after the midterms is that the President did not want time for Mueller to produce any indictments after the end of a self-imposed hiatus during the political season. Whitaker has walked into tremendous personal pressure. Trump has made no secret of his visceral anger at Mueller, and has shown -- in his dealings with fired former FBI Director James Comey and Sessions -- that he expects loyalty to him to supersede everything. Whitaker will face the same demands and is in a far weaker position than either Sessions or Comey, who enjoyed personal power bases and reputations and alliances forged after decades of public service. Once he is read into the Mueller investigation, the new attorney general will face an ethical question. Will he tell Trump what he knows even though doing so would cross an ethical line? But Whitaker is also in a legally vulnerable position. He risks being pulled into a conspiracy if the President or other officials seek to unlawfully obstruct the investigation. He is likely to be hauled up to Capitol Hill by the new Democratic House majority in the new year and be forced to testify under oath about his appointment. He might remember that Nixon Attorney General John Mitchell was convicted for his role in Watergate. At some point, Whitaker may face the ultimate dilemma for a Washington law enforcement official caught in a scandal. Does his duty to the Constitution or his President take priority? Mueller: Keep calm and carry on?  Mueller's silence has been his best defense against ferocious efforts by Trump and the conservative media machine to draw him into the political swamp. So it is, and always will be, impossible to know what he thinks about the new Justice Department hierarchy. CNN reported Thursday that the special counsel had started writing his final report. Recent weeks grand jury activity indicates that Mueller is trying to find out whether Trump's longtime adviser, Roger Stone, knew in advance that Wikileaks would release hacked material during the 2016 campaign. But there was also a reminder on Thursday that his freedom to act could be in doubt when Michael Dreeben, a prosecutor for the special counsel's office acknowledged in court that Whitaker could change or rescind the May 2017 order that appointed Mueller. People who have worked with Mueller believe he has already prepared for the suppression or shutting down of his work. He has for instance farmed out the tax fraud case against Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen to prosecutors in New York. There was speculation in Washington recently that sealed indictments against targets of the probe may already have been filed. Mueller has some protection in his initial charge from Rosenstein. If Whitaker takes steps to constrain Mueller, he would be required to explain to the leadership of the Senate and House Judiciary committees why he did so. In theory, he can also only be fired for cause or misconduct. In the last resort, his resignation would provoke a political firestorm that could lead to impeachment proceedings against the President. But it would also risk the possibility that much of his work does not see the light of day. Pelosi: The institutional check on Trump  Pelosi is likely to be the next House speaker and will have the power to have an institutional check on the administration. She will have authority over House committees that will provide oversight of Trump and the Justice Department. On Thursday, she held a conference call with new and existing members to discuss the Sessions firing and Whitaker's appointment, sources told CNN. Democrats have already indicated that they will investigate Trump's appointment of Whitaker. They are likely to reinvigorate the House Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation when they get the gavel. Pelosi will be pulled in multiple directions. She faces an imperative to respond to any attempts by Trump to curtail Mueller. But as preparations begin for the 2020 election, she must guard against actions that could be portrayed by the GOP as overreach. At the same time, she will face pressure from her left from liberal activists who are already demanding Trump's impeachment. ""I don't think we should impeach a president for political reasons. But I don't think we should not impeach him because we think it's politically ... impeding for us to do so,"" Pelosi told CNN's Chris Cuomo in an interview Thursday.

Sessions 'confident' Mueller probe will be handled 'appropriately' ,"Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressed confidence in a new interview that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election will be handled ""appropriately.""

Sessions' successor at the Justice Department, Matthew Whitaker, has faced criticism for his previous comments arguing that Mueller's investigation goes too far. Despite his past comments, however, Whitaker appears unlikely to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation. Sessions told the Journal that if given a second chance, he would still recuse himself from the probe despite the decision angering President Donald Trump. ""No one is above supervision,"" he told the Journal. Sessions was fired as attorney general with a call from Trump's chief of staff John Kelly on Wednesday afternoon. Sessions' last day was busy but routine -- until Kelly's unexpected call just prior to Trump's 11:30 a.m., post-election news conference, he told the Journal. He declined to comment on his discussions with White House officials about his ouster. Sessions told the Journal he has no concrete future plans.

Whitaker backlash prompts concern at the White House ,"There is a growing sense of concern inside the White House over the negative reaction to Matthew Whitaker being tapped as acting attorney general after Jeff Sessions' abrupt firing.  Whitaker, who was Sessions' chief of staff, has faced criticism since Wednesday afternoon's announcement for his previous comments on special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Several senior officials told CNN they were surprised by the criticism, and believe it could potentially jeopardize Whitaker's chances of remaining in the post if it continues to dominate headlines. Whitaker is expected to take over oversight of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump campaign associates colluded with Russia. He has given no indication he believes he needs to step aside from overseeing the probe, according to one person familiar with his thinking, a belief echoed by White House officials. And a source close to the President told CNN that the idea of Whitaker ending or suppressing the Russia probe is not an option as of now. But Whitaker has previously expressed deep skepticism about the probe, including arguing in a 2017 CNN op-ed that Mueller was ""dangerously close to crossing"" a red line following reports that the special counsel was looking into Trump's finances and calling Mueller's appointment ""ridiculous"" and ""a little fishy"" in a 2017 appearance on the ""Rose Unplugged"" radio program. Whitaker also spoke about the investigation in numerous other radio and television appearances, including CNN, where he was a legal commentator. It was not widely known among White House staff that he'd commented repeatedly on the special counsel's investigation in interviews and on television -- which is ironic given that this is what drew President Donald Trump to him and raises continued questions over the depth of the administration's vetting process. Sam Clovis, a 2016 Trump campaign national chairman who has close ties to Whitaker, encouraged him to get a regular commentary gig on cable television to get Trump's attention, according to friends Whitaker told at the time. Whitaker was hired as a CNN legal commentator last year for several months before leaving the role in September 2017 to head to the Justice Department. Along with the breadth of his previous comments on the investigation, there have been questions about the legality of Whitaker's appointment. George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, co-authored a New York Times op-ed published Thursday that called the appointment ""unconstitutional."" The Appointments Clause of the Constitution, Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, Conway wrote, ""means Mr. Trump's installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States after forcing the resignation of Jeff Sessions is unconstitutional. It's illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid."" Whitaker's standing ultimately depends on the President. But continued negative coverage will get Trump's attention.

Trump hints at potential federal role in Florida recount ,"President Donald Trump suggested Friday that the federal government could play a role in a possible recount of Florida's close Senate and gubernatorial races.  ""If you look at Broward and Palm Beach (counties) to a lesser extent ... they have had a horrible history,"" Trump told reporters at the White House before departing for Paris. ""And if you look at the person, in this case a woman, involved -- she has had a horrible history,"" Trump said. It was unclear to whom Trump was referring, but Republican Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican candidate for Senate, has called the female election supervisors in Broward and Palm Beach counties ""unethical liberals."" Broward and Palm Beach counties are at the center of a brewing Florida recount. Again. Broward and Palm Beach counties are at the center of a brewing Florida recount. Again. ""All of a sudden they are finding votes out of nowhere,"" Trump said of the Senate race. The President said Scott had ""won by a comfortable margin,"" but accused Democrats of attempting to pad their margins. ""Every couple of hours, it goes down a little bit,"" Trump said of Scott's lead. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson has pushed for a recount given that he trails Scott by such a slim margin. If the candidates in either contest are separated by 0.5% of the vote or less, the state will automatically recount ballots. Trump tweeted Thursday evening that reported irregularities in Broward and Palm Beach counties amounted to ""another big corruption scandal having to do with election fraud."" The President said officials involved in the ""phony dossier"" about his campaign's contacts with Russia are involved in the recount efforts. He was likely referring to Marc Elias, the lawyer Nelson's campaign has reportedly tapped to handle the recount effort, as Elias was also a lawyer for Hillary Clinton's campaign and was involved in commissioning that dossier of opposition research from Fusion GPS. The race for governor between GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis and Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum is also close enough that a recount is possible.",POLITICS,Real
China grants 16 trademarks to defunct Ivanka Trump business ,"China has granted preliminary approval for 16 trademarks for fashion accessories and other items to White House adviser and presidential daughter Ivanka Trump, even though she announced earlier this year she's shutting her business down.  The approvals, which were applied for in March and May 2016, underscore the ongoing entanglement of President Donald Trump and his family with the Chinese government through the Trumps' various business interests in the country, past and present. Chinese government records show that the trademark applications received preliminary approvals last month. Such decisions usually become final after a three-month public comment period. Most applications were related to fashion items such as shoes and handbags, but one was for an unspecified item in a category that covers voting machines, as well as gadgets and electronics ranging from cameras and telephones to semiconductors. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the trademark approvals, which were first reported by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit group that has previously sued the President over his business interests. In China, where shoes carrying Ivanka Trump's brand were once made, she had previously scored batches of trademarks on a wide array of products, including in late May — when her father's administration was engaged in intense trade negotiations with Beijing. At the time, Ivanka Trump's business representative said the fashion line regularly filed such applications, especially in areas where trademark infringement was rampant. ""We have recently seen a surge in trademark filings by unrelated third parties trying to capitalize on the name and it is our responsibility to diligently protect our trademark,"" said Abigail Klem, who was then the president of the Ivanka Trump brand. Escalating trade war The US-China trade talks ultimately failed, and the Trump administration subsequently slapped steep tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. China has retaliated by imposing tariffs on $110 billion of American products. Tensions have also been growing in other areas between Washington and Beijing, from the military to intelligence and diplomacy. Speaking at a United Nations meeting in September, President Trump claimed, without offering evidence, that China was trying to interfere with the US midterm elections. ""They do not want me, or us, to win, because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade, and we are winning on trade,"" he said. ""We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election."" The Trump Organization, the family company that is now run by the President's sons, has also had a slew of trademarks approved by Beijing, many of them after his election victory in 2016. Ethics experts have said Beijing could be seeking to influence the President by awarding him and his family the trademarks, but the Chinese government has dismissed those assertions, emphasizing that authorities follow the law in reviewing all applications. President Trump is being sued by the governments of Washington DC and Maryland on claims that his continued interest in the Trump International Hotel, which has become a gathering place for foreign governments with business before the administration, puts him in violation of a constitutional clause banning presidents from accepting gifts from foreign governments. A federal judge last week allowed discovery to proceed in that case, meaning Trump will have to turn over business records associated with the hotel.

The rule becomes effective once a presidential proclamation is issued, which is expected to happen Friday, according to senior administration officials. The administration announced a new federal rule -- issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department -- that will limit eligibility for asylum seekers coming from Mexico, in a call with reporters Thursday afternoon. The interim rule, which is set to be published in the Federal Register on Friday, states that ""if applied to a proclamation suspending the entry of aliens who cross the southern border unlawfully, would bar such aliens from eligibility for asylum and thereby channel inadmissible aliens to ports of entry, where they would be processed in a controlled, orderly and lawful manner."" The rule adds that ""aliens who enter prior to the effective date of an applicable proclamation will not be subject to the asylum eligibility bar unless they depart and reenter while the proclamation remains in effect."" The regulation will also amend the screening process for aliens subject to a bar on asylum eligibility, a senior administration official said. The rule does not specify whom it applies to, but discusses the issue in the context of increasing asylum claims from Central America. ""We do not expect one action"" to solve immigration problems, the officials said. Trump says he will restrict asylum, claims troops will shoot at rock throwers Trump says he will restrict asylum, claims troops will shoot at rock throwers This is just one effort to address the issue and ""I would expect we would work on additional measures in the future,"" one official said. An official on the call said the Department of Homeland Security has started to work on staffing models to handle asylum claims they will be seeing at legal ports of entry. A Justice Department official said the rule was signed off by Attorney General Jeff Sessions before he tendered his resignation this week, not the new acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker. The American Civil Liberties Union called the rule ""illegal."" ""US law specifically allows individuals to apply for asylum whether or not they are at a port of entry. It is illegal to circumvent that by agency or presidential decree,"" said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project. The Center for American Progress also challenged the interim final rule's legality, saying it violates the plain text of the INA. ""When Congress in 1996 enacted sweeping immigration enforcement legislation—putting in place the expedited removal system that today allows Border Patrol agents to quickly deport people they apprehend without any court process—it specifically created the credible fear process to preserve the right of people to seek asylum when they are apprehended between the ports of entry,"" said Tom Jawetz, vice president of Immigration Policy at the Center for American Progress, in a statement. ""Congress did that knowing that if it circumscribed the right to seek protection, then it would run afoul of our obligations under US and international law to not return people to face persecution abroad. The interim final rule issued today acknowledges this history even as it attempts to undo it entirely."" Human Rights First's Eleanor Acer called the new rule ""the latest shameful tactic in a years-long campaign to vilify and punish those who seek protection in this country."" ""President Trump's scheme violates refugee treaties, and is a convoluted attempt to rewrite the laws enacted by Congress to protect those seeking asylum. This country is more than capable of safely processing asylum seekers to determine who among them have protection claims. Border officers already have extensive tools and resources that allow them to identify any individuals seeking entry who present a danger,"" Acer added. There was an effort to finalize the rule in time for the President to sign by Friday morning, before he leaves for Paris, according to a senior administration official. Trump first revealed plans to take unilateral steps during a rambling and detail-free speech from the White House last week. Warning of a crisis at the southern border, Trump's remarks were viewed as a political stunt days before the midterms. Since Tuesday's vote -- which saw Democrats take control of the House but Republicans retain control of the Senate -- the President hasn't mentioned the immigration orders or tweeted about the migrant caravan that formed his campaign closing argument. A White House aide told CNN ahead of Trump's remarks last week the President would unveil an executive action requiring migrants to request asylum at legal points of entry and preventing them from claiming asylum if they are caught crossing the border illegally. Although the President referenced such a policy in his speech, he offered no defense of how such a plan, once finalized, could be legal, given laws presently allowing migrants the right to claim asylum once they are on American soil. The Trump administration has been looking at ways to limit the number of asylum seekers, with the President and his allies often describing asylum as a ""loophole."" The Immigration and Nationality Act says that anyone who arrives in the US ""whether or not at a designated port of arrival"" may apply for asylum if he or she has a ""well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion."" CNN has also reported the administration is considering a plan to limit the number of migrants able to enter at legal ports of entry by ""metering,"" essentially creating a waitlist to allow people to enter only if the Department of Homeland Security has the capacity to process and detain them at one of its facilities, a department official said. In the past, the practice of metering has resulted in individuals deciding not to endure a lengthy wait to try to get into the country legally and instead to cross illegally. Should some of this group of migrants do the latter, they could face a tougher and higher standard for seeking asylum under the administration's plans.

"New lawsuit claims Trump, children made millions off investment scams ","President Donald Trump, his three eldest children and his company are accused in a class action lawsuit filed Monday in Manhattan federal court of using their brand to make millions by coaxing unsophisticated investors to participate in fraudulent schemes.  Filed on behalf of four anonymous individuals, the lawsuit accuses the President and his children Eric, Donald Jr. and Ivanka Trump of promoting what they described as promising business opportunities with three companies in exchange for ""secret"" payments: ACN Opportunity, a telecommunications marketing company; the Trump Network, a vitamin and health product marketing company; and the Trump Institute, a seminar program that ""purported to sell Trump's 'secrets to success.' "" The suit claims that the Trumps in fact ""deliberately misled"" consumers about the likely success of their investments. The 160-page lawsuit further claims the Trumps engaged in ""a pattern of racketeering activity"" and ""were aware that the vast majority of consumers would lose whatever money they invested in the business opportunities and training programs"" offered by the three companies. None of the three companies is named as a defendant. The lawsuit is being funded by a nonprofit with ties to Democratic candidates, the Tesseract Research Center, according to a spokesman for the law firm Kaplan, Hecker & Fink. A partner in that firm, Roberta Kaplan, as well as Andrew G. Celli Jr., of Emery, Celli, Brinckerhoff & Abady, are representing the plaintiffs. In response to the suit, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, Alan Garten, said the case was ""completely meritless"" and seized on the Democratic affiliations of Tesseract and the plaintiff's lawyers. ""This is clearly just another effort by opponents of the President to use the court system to advance a political agenda,"" Garten said in a statement. He also noted the timing of the suit heading into the midterm elections on November 6, adding: ""The motivations here are as plain as day."" A spokesman for the plaintiffs' legal team said the case was filed Monday ""because it is ready now."" ""We did a thorough investigation and a lot of legal research, and the plaintiffs are eager to file,"" he added. ""No matter when this was filed, the Trump Org would say it was politically motivated."" Trump has faced similar allegations of fraud before, most notably in three lawsuits brought against Trump University, his now-defunct real estate seminar that purported to reveal his business secrets to students. Trump agreed to settle those lawsuits, which alleged the program featured false advertisements and never delivered on its claims, for $25 million just days after the 2016 presidential election. The new lawsuit filed Monday contends that, as in the Trump University case, the Trump brand and the apparent endorsement from Trump himself were critical in luring unsuspecting investors to the sham companies he promoted. ""Indeed, for the working people who fell prey to the Investments, the Trump endorsement was typically the first thing they learned about the Investments, the reason they took an interest, and the determining factor in their decision to invest,"" the lawsuit says. For example, in the case of a plaintiff identified only as ""Luke Loe,"" Trump's appearance in a promotional video shown to prospective ACN participants sealed the deal for Loe as a ""good moneymaking opportunity,"" court filings say. At the time, in 2014, Loe was homeless and working for the Salvation Army, and unable to afford the $499 ACN registration fee. But, based on Trump's endorsement, the filings say, Loe took a $499 loan from a friend to join ACN, then attended 25 to 30 meetings, each costing $10 to $20. After months of sinking money into the company, including to attend a national convention in Cleveland, where he watched Trump appear again via videotape, Loe realized he'd had enough, and quit ACN. "" 'Trust me,' Trump often said in endorsing and promoting the Investments,"" the lawsuit adds. ""Unfortunately, far too many victims did.""",POLITICS,Real

"World’s Oldest Painting Discovered in Borneo Cave; Artist Lived 40,000 Years Ago ","While the names of Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Monet and Picasso echo through the ages, and loom large over the annals of art history, archaeologists have found the work of the world’s first true artist. While the series of cave paintings in Borneo were discovered in 1994, recent analysis has dated them back to around 40,000 years ago.   The Guardian quoted Maxime Aubert, an archaeologist and geochemist at the Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, as saying, “It is the oldest figurative cave painting in the world. It’s amazing to see that. It’s an intimate window into the past.”  The faded, cracked reddish-orange image depicts a rotund but slender-legged animal, presumed to be a species of the wild cattle which still roam the island. Given that the animal is slashed with a straight line at its side, which researchers say could depict a spear, it is evident that the artist was hungry at the time of drawing his masterpiece.  The Guardian reported that the animal is one of a trio of large creatures etched on a wall in the Lubang Jeriji Saléh cave, which is located in the province of East Kalimantan in Indonesian Borneo. The region is known for its ancient rock art, which comprise thousands of paintings dotting the limestone caves, and has been studied since 1994, when the first drawings were spotted by French explorer Luc-Henri Fage.  While this is arguably the world’s first figurative painting, rock art itself is thought to have begun much earlier, when Neanderthals decorated the walls of caves in modern Spain much before our first human ancestors reached Europe. In September, researchers revealed their analysis of a 73,000-year-old lump of rock, marked with a crisscross design, which was discovered during excavation in a cave in South Africa.",ENTERTAINMENT,Real
"Google Doodle honors Amanda Crowe, who led resurgence of Native American art ","Friday's Google Doodle celebrates Amanda Crowe, a Cherokee artist whose animal carvings kick-started a Native American art revival.  The video Doodle highlights Crowe's work and words, with music by her nephew Bill, and is part of Google's nod to Native American Heritage Month.  The pieces seen in the video are housed at Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual, the country's oldest American Indian cooperative, in Cherokee, North Carolina. Crowe's work has also been displayed at Atlanta's High Museum and Charlotte's Mint Museum.   Crowe was born in North Carolina's Qualla Boundary, a territory owned by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, on July 16, 1928, and started making art four years later, learning from her woodcarver uncle Goingback Chiltoskey.  51j84ff2swl-sx317-bo1204203200 Crowe illustrated Cherokee Legends and the Trail of Tears.  Cherokee Publications ""The grain challenges me to create objects in three dimensions,"" she said of her craft. ""A mistake or flaw in the wood will improve your design. To me, a knot can be the best part.""  She went on to earn a master of fine arts degree from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1952, then studied with sculptor Jose de Creeft in Mexico before returning home to teach art classes at Cherokee High School.  Crowe passed on her skills to more than 2,000 students over 40 years and illustrated the 1956 book Cherokee Legends and the Trail of Tears. She died in 2004.  In many countries outside the US, Friday's Doodle paid tribute to Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu, one of the world's first female engineers, on what would've been her 131st birthday.",ENTERTAINMENT,Real
"Bill Cosby Sells Painting, Takes Loan on Vast Art Collection ","(Bloomberg) -- Bill Cosby and his wife Camille privately sold an iconic painting by Thomas Hart Benton called “Going West” earlier this year, according to gallery owners who participated in the deal.  Camille Cosby also pledged another Benton painting, “The Instruction,” as collateral for a loan from an art finance firm run by Asher Edelman, according to a September regulatory filing. Edelman confirmed the loan.  Beginning in the late 1960s, the couple built “the most significant collection in the hands of an African American family,” David Driskell, their former curator, wrote in a book titled “The Other Side of Color.” They acquired at least 300 works by artists of color as well as those by Renoir, Rembrandt, Picasso and Matisse.  Values Increased Andrew Wyatt, a spokesman for the Cosbys, said he hadn’t been aware of their art sale and declined to comment. Bill Cosby was sentenced in September to three-to-10 years in prison for sexual assault.  The family bought much of their collection when it was undervalued and many of the works have since jumped in value, said Buck Kiechel, the owner of an art gallery in Lincoln, Nebraska. Kiechel, whose specialties include works by Benton, said “Going West” is “arguably the greatest American painting from the 1920s that wasn’t painted by Edward Hopper.”  Bill Cosby Sells Painting, Takes Loan on Vast Art Collection The Cosbys sold “Going West” during the first half of this year, according to gallery owners Chris Morse and Clay Surovek. The buyer, whom they declined to identify, put the work up for sale in Morse’s Granary Gallery on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts -- where Benton summered for many decades. It’s now at Surovek’s gallery in Palm Beach, Florida, for an upcoming exhibition on the artist.  Midwest America Benton depicted daily life in Midwest America primarily after the Great Depression. His auction record is $4.9 million for “Ozark Autumn” sold at Christie’s in 2015.  Bill Cosby Sells Painting, Takes Loan on Vast Art Collection Kiechel estimated that “Going West” and “The Instruction” have a combined market value of $12 million to $14 million. Morse and Surovek declined to disclose the asking price for “Going West.” Cosby paid $105,000 for “The Instruction,"" according to a December 1978 article in the magazine Jet.

Tirur Railway Station Removes Wagon Tragedy Mural Painting After Protests from Right-wing Outfits ,"Malappuram: A newly made mural depicting the historic Wagon Tragedy was removed from Kerala’s Tirur Railway Station following complaints from fringe right-wing outfits, stoking a fresh controversy in the state.  On Saturday, a wall near the ticket counter at Tirur station was painted to depict the 1921 incident as part of the railway’s beautification programme. However, it was removed within two days. Critics allege the painting was erased after the railways succumbed to pressure from right-wing outfits.  Lashing out at the Railways for removing the painting, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the decision amounted to insulting the struggle.  “The mural was made as part of the beautification work at the station. But railway authorities have decided to remove it because of opposition from Sangh Parivar. It is not difficult to understand the opposition of RSS to this painting. RSS is in general allergic to the memories of Indian Independence struggle,” Vijayan wrote on Facebook.  The chief minister further said the RSS had no role in the struggle and hated its “golden chapters”.  The southern railway officials, meanwhile, denied the claims and said there was no pressure to remove the murals. “The murals were removed as they were not in line with the railway’s beautification instructions. A lot of people, including public representatives, had approached us saying the murals can give rise to a sense of fear among people,” says MK Gopinath, public relations officer, Palghat railway division.  The 1921 Wagon Tragedy took place during the Mappila rebellion in Malabar against British rulers and Hindu landlords. Ninety Muslim rebels were arrested and sent to Podanur prison in Coimbatore in a windowless freight wagon, leading to least 60 of them being suffocated to death.  Apart from the Wagon Tragedy murals, the legacy of Thunchath Ezhuthachan – the 16th century Malayam devotional poet – has also been painted at Tirur railway station.",ENTERTAINMENT,Real
Marvel Concept Artist Reveals What James Gunn Added to Groot's Design for 'Avengers: Infinity War' ,"After being set up in the mid-credits scenes for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, fans got to see the crappy attitude of teenage Groot in all of his snooty glory in Avengers: Infinity War.  And though Joe and Anthony Russo took the reins in charting this character's adventure, it was Guardians director James Gunn who had a major influence on Groot's appearance in the new movie, according to senior visual development artist Anthony Francisco.  ""James Gunn also wanted to add a bit of an ungroomed attitude where he does not clean up after himself, like trimming his greenery in those awkward spaces and adding a little belly to show him not caring about his appearance,"" Francisco told The Art of Avengers: Infinity War.  As an executive producer on the new movie, Gunn had a lot of influence over the direction of the Guardians in Avengers: Infinity War, and not just with the characters' appearances. Infinity War co-writer Christopher Markus spoke about how James Gunn affected the film's story.  ""James' contributions were primarily voice-related, to make sure that we are not rolling out people who bear no resemblance to people in the preceding Guardians movies,"" Markus said to The Hollywood Reporter. ""He was on board everywhere we were taking them. He adjusted one choice in the movie that didn't really affect how the movie played, but it affected character a little bit. It was a very interesting choice, and first we wavered on it, and then [Guardians star Chris] Pratt backed him up. And we acknowledged, if anyone knows these characters, it's them.""  Co-writer Stephen McFeely addressed how Infinity War brought in many popular Marvel characters from different franchises, including Black Panther and Doctor Strange, and how they were able to lean on the filmmakers for guidance.  ""That's the benefit of all of this. The filmmakers who spent a lot of time with these characters get to come in and help us make sure we are getting it letter perfect,"" McFeely said. ""There are 23 people on that poster, so there are going to be people who are slightly more expert at those characters than we are. So, we did that with everybody. [Doctor Strange director Scott] Derrickson and [Black Panther director Ryan] Coogler and [Thor: Ragnarok director] Taika [Waititi] and [Ant-Man director] Peyton Reed.""  0 COMMENTS We'll see how those directors' influences extend into the future when Avengers 4 premieres in theaters on May 3.",ENTERTAINMENT,Real
Leaked Avengers 4 Art Reveals The Team’s New White Suits ,"The merchandising for Avengers 4 has been the source of a lot of leaks lately, and though there’s much debate to be had on the authenticity and the implications of what we’ve been seeing, the intel has certainly done its job in getting fans excited about what may or may not be coming down the pipeline in next year’s sequel.  Just take this latest leak, for instance. Having surfaced over on Reddit earlier this morning, the source for it is still unclear, but it appears to be some early concept art for either the film itself, or merchandise related to it, and shows us the Avengers in their new white costumes, which we’ve caught a few glimpses of already.  It’s thought that these shiny suits will be donned by Earth’s Mightiest Heroes for their journey into space, or even the Quantum Realm. After all, we know that the Avengers: Infinity War sequel will feature some interplanetary trips, while the Realm itself was more or less confirmed earlier this year to have a lot of significance to the story.  Though some have cast doubt on this latest leak being genuine, it’s important to note that Rocket is seen here in the same stance as he was in on that leaked photo from September, which was, indeed, real. And in case you’ve forgotten about it, we’ve included it in the gallery below so you can compare.  Leaked Avengers 4 Art Reveals The Team's New White Suits 1 of 12      PrevNext CLICK TO ZOOM  Speaking of that picture, it spawned much speculation thanks to the accompanying text’s suggestion of “new foes” and “an even greater threat.” Given that the main antagonist of Infinity War was a genocidal tyrant who reduced half the universe’s population into dust with the mere snap of his fingers, we struggle to think of what could qualify as a bigger danger, but recent theories are suggesting a powerful new ally for Thanos.  Circling back to this latest leak, though, and as always, we’d suggest approaching it with a sense of caution, at least until a source can be confirmed. That being said, what we see here does look pretty exciting and even if it’s not exactly how the heroes will appear on screen in Avengers 4, you can be sure that most of the characters will be receiving some sort of upgrade or change in the costume department at some point in the film.",ENTERTAINMENT,Real
Captain America's Early Infinity War Design Resembled US Agent ,"Chris Evans' Captain America in this year's Avengers: Infinity War was a man without a country, a former patriot turned fugitive insurgent after the events of 2016's Captain America: Civil War. But while Infinity War ultimately dressed the Marvel Cinematic Universe's superhero in a faded, tattered version of his uniform from Civil War, early concept art for the film had a different design for the Star Spangled Avenger.  Revealed in Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War - The Art of the Movie, concept art by Marvel Studios Head of Visual Development Ryan Meinerding had Steve Rogers originally sporting an outfit inspired by recurring Captain America friend-and-foe US Agent, with more black than the usual dark blue and a prominent stars and stripes design across the torso.  RELATED: Thicc, Shirtless Biker Thanos Smolders In Avengers: Infinity War Movie Art Book    ""The Secret Avenger look came about because him being more clandestine and not part of a larger group like the Avengers meant that he could be wearing more black,"" explained Meinerding about the early design. ""That's where the US Agent stuff came out, too, where he could be wearing black and red, and see if there was any value in that.""  Following the events of Civil War, Evans' character was rumored to take on the alter ego Nomad, an alternate persona used by Steve Rogers after dropping the mantle of Captain America in the comics in the 1970s. This rumor was ultimately refuted by Infinity War co-director Joe Russo. Now, Meinerding reveals that Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige wanted to find a way for the character to retain his iconic look while acknowledging his drastic change in status.  RELATED: Cap Leaves His Costume Behind in Early Avengers: Infinity War Concept Art  ""The costume took a long time because I think Kevin [Feige] was looking for ways of Cap still feeling iconic. He didn't want him stepping away from the super hero stuff for the whole movie. And if you put him in fatigues at the beginning of the movie, there's not really a reason for him to get out of them or change costumes at any point in the rest of the film,"" continued Meinerding. ""So we were searching for a while, including versions that were riffs on US Agent and some things that were riffs on Nomad -- subtle one, but still trying to go there to see if there was something interesting to mine, as if he's almost taken on a different persona.""  With the stars and stripes emblazoned across the early design's torso, Steve Rogers' proposed outfit is recognizable but too visibly different than previous incarnations of his uniform as Captain America throughout his earlier appearances in the MCU. The costume used in the final film is more consistent with previous iterations with vertical stars and stripes displayed less prominently and the outline of the single iconic star still present on the chest though the star itself appears long since discarded by the fugitive superhero.  RELATED: Loki's Infinity War Fate Was Very Different In An Earlier Script  The scrapped design evokes the Captain America rival created by writer Mark Gruenwald and artist Kieron Dwyer in the pages of 1989's Captain America #354. It's also is visually reminiscent of Steve Rogers' 1980s alter ego The Captain, introduced in Captain America #337 before Rogers ultimately confronts future US Agent John Walker in Captain America #350 and reclaims the mantle he had previously abandoned.    While it's unlikely that Chris Evans will adopt the design in next year's Avengers 4, the concept art does provide an interesting look at how the character could have appeared while operating as a rogue superhero in the eyes of the international community without abandoning his patriotic ideals.  In the meantime, both Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War - The Art of the Movie and the film are available now.  ",ENTERTAINMENT,Real

"Will Gompertz reviews Russia, Royalty & the Romanovs ★★★★☆ ","This exhibition at The Queen's Gallery in Buckingham Palace starts with a huge painting of a huge man: the aptly-named Peter the Great of Russia, the first Tsar to leave his country in over 100 years.  The catalogue says it presents us with ""a tall, virile, handsome warrior"".  Image copyrightROYAL COLLECTION TRUST Image caption Sir Godfrey Kneller's portrait of Tsar Peter I (1672-1725), who was the first Russian ruler to visit England The diplomat Prince Boris Kurakin (1676-1727) was similarly enamoured with the artwork. He said: ""The famed portrait of His Czarish Majesty standing in all his imperial armour and so attractive, that I have nowhere seen its equal.""  I do not share their view.  Godfrey Kneller's very grand and historically significant picture depicts a bug-eyed, 6ft 7in, fey-looking 26-year-old who seems to be as much at home in his suit of armour as Ann Widdecombe was on Strictly Come Dancing.  The painting was Peter's gift to the English king, William III, to mark his three-month-long fact-finding visit to England in 1698. The ambitious young ruler was keen to build a Russian navy from scratch to match those of the great European powers.  Image copyrightROYAL COLLECTION TRUST Image caption William III was happy to overlook Peter the Great's wayward behaviour So he rented a house in Deptford from the writer and diarist John Evelyn, a chum of Samuel Pepys, and set about learning all there was to know about shipbuilding at the local dockyard, while hoovering up tips on navigation from the nearby Royal Observatory at Greenwich.  The trip was a tremendous success for Peter, who, by the end of his reign, had 28,000 men serving 49 ships and around 800 smaller boats.  It wasn't so good for John Evelyn, though. His majestic tenant had a rock star's approach to renting: paintings were used for target practice, wheelbarrows as go-karts, and the furniture - that which remained - was left in more pieces than a jigsaw of St Petersburg.  William III was happy to overlook the wayward behaviour of his Russian opposite number, seeing the empire-building emperor as an important strategic ally and valued trading partner. And so began a diplomatic relationship between the two monarchies that would span centuries, marriages, wars and the exchanges of many gifts and paintings.  Image copyrightROYAL COLLECTION TRUST Image caption The coronation portrait of Empress Catherine II (1729-1796), by Vigilius Eriksen, was believed to have been given to King George III On the whole, it is the gifts and subsequent purchases of Russian objects made by the British Royal Family that are the stars of this show.  The paintings are a mixed bag - some good, some bad, none great. Quite unlike the cabinets full of pieces by the Russian jeweller Peter Carl Fabergé, which are exquisite.  His pair of late 19th Century decanters topped off with silver dolphins with mouths formed into spouts are wonderful. As is the gold and blue moire guilloche enamel cigarette case, which is decorated with a diamond-set snake biting its tail, a symbol of everlasting love (it was given to King Edward VII by his mistress, Alice Keppel).  Image copyrightROYAL COLLECTION TRUST And then there are the three Imperial Fabergé Eggs, the most striking of which is the Mosaic Egg and Surprise. The lattice-like exterior is not only the most beautiful piece of craftsmanship, but is also a profoundly sad vessel encapsulating a tragic event.  Inside the egg, the ""surprise"" is an enamel portrait of five children in profile, on the reverse of which is a basket of flowers and an inscription of each of their names. Tsar Nicholas II commissioned it for his wife Alexandra - Queen Victoria's granddaughter - as an Easter present. The children it depicts are theirs.  Image copyrightROYAL COLLECTION TRUST Image caption Mosaic Egg and Surprise (1914) by Fabergé, was originally commissioned by Nicholas II, and later bought by King George V and Queen Mary It was made in the spring of 1914 shortly before Russia became embroiled in World War One. Nicholas was not a great leader, nor a popular figure. Millions of Russian soldiers died, leading to revolution and his forced abdication in 1917. The provisional government confiscated the Mosaic Egg and Surprise.  The Tsar asked the British Royal Family to rescue him - after all, the families went a long way back, as this exhibition demonstrates.  King George V declined.  On 17 July 1918, Tsar Nicholas, his wife and all five children were executed by Bolshevik guards.  Fifteen years later, George V purchased the Mosaic Egg and Surprise from Cameo Corner, London, for £250.  This is but one of the hundreds of historical events reflected in the objects and paintings in this rigorously researched exhibition.  It is a grand tale of international relations and inter-family arrangements, of cultural exchange and competing agendas. The major players line the walls in over-the-top gilt frames, while the objects that fill the exhibition spaces tell their stories.  Image copyrightROYAL COLLECTION TRUST Image caption Laurits Regner Tuxen's painting of the Marriage of Nicholas II, Emperor of Russia, in 1894, to Princess Alix of Hesse, who was Queen Victoria's granddaughter There are instances when the object is not as interesting as the piece of history it represents, but that is not the case in the sideshow of Roger Fenton photographs of the Crimean War that is connected to the main exhibition, which serves as a reminder that all was not always rosy in the 300-year Anglo-Russian relationship.  Fenton's intelligently composed images of the soldiers and battlegrounds are as good as those produced on any subject since the birth of the medium. When you take into account the limitations of his equipment and the hostile environment in which he was using it, you quickly recognise that his photographs are remarkable.  Having been commissioned by the print publishers Thomas Agnew & Sons to take pictures of British and French soldiers as source material for a studio painting by Thomas Barker, Fenton set off for the Crimea in the spring of 1855 with a makeshift, horse-drawn photographic van and an assistant.  He organised group photographs, individual portraits and desolate landscapes strewn with the debris of war. The most famous photo is Valley of the Shadow of Death - a bleak and barren dirt track littered with cannonballs: an image of Armageddon.  Image copyrightROYAL COLLECTION TRUST Image caption Valley of the Shadow of Death, 1855 by Roger Fenton, who places the viewer at the bottom of the ravine filled with cannonballs It is a haunting picture of war without any blood or bodies.  His portrait of the unlucky Lord Balgonie, who stares out into the middle distance in wide-eyed confusion, is thought to be the first image taken of shellshock.

It brings home Fenton's genius for finding the truth in his subject, and the utter hopelessness of the artist attempting to do the same.  When he returned home, his Crimea photographs were much admired by Queen Victoria and her tech-savvy husband Prince Albert, who had previously commissioned the photographer to take portraits of the Royal Family.

"Jeff Koons Is Found Guilty of Plagiarism in Paris and Ordered to Pay $168,000 to the Creator of an Ad He Appropriated ","A French adman claims victory in his legal battle with the US artist over a surreal campaign featuring a rescue pig and freezing model.  Naomi Rea, November 9, 2018   Jeff Koons. Photo: Adam Berry/Getty Images. A French judge has found Jeff Koons guilty in his four-year-long legal battle with the creator of a surreal 1980s ad campaign who claims the American artist stole his work.  French ad executive Franck Davidovici created the campaign, titled Fait d’Hiver, in 1985 for the French clothing brand Naf Naf. After seeing Koons’s work exhibited at the Pompidou Center in 2014, he sued the American artist for copyright infringement, accusing him of plagiarizing his advertisement to create a 1988 sculpture that was also called Fait d’Hiver.  Davidovici asked for €300,000 ($352,000) in damages and for Koons’s sculpture to be seized by the state. On Thursday, a Paris court ordered the artist, his business, and the French museum to pay Davidovici a total of €135,000 ($153,000). Jeff Koons LLC was also fined €11,000 for reproducing the work on Koons’s website, while a publishing house that sold a book in which the work was reproduced was fined €2,000. The court did not, however, order the sculpture’s seizure.  artnet News reached out to Davidovici’s lawyer, Jeff Koons’s studio, and the Centre Pompidou for comment but did not hear back by press time.   Franck Davidovici’s “Fait d’Hiver” ad campaign for Naf Naf (1985).  Davidovici’s campaign for the women’s ready-to-wear label featured a pig (Naf Naf’s mascot) with a cask of brandy around its neck coming to the aid of a model buried in an avalanche.  Koons’s porcelain work, realized three years later, depicts a similar scene, although Koons’s version pictures the Italian porn star Ilona Staller (his ex-wife) wearing a breast-baring fishnet top in place of a jacket. The pig’s brandy cask has been replaced by a flower garland, and there’s a penguin thrown in for good measure. According to the French newspaper Le Figaro, Davidovici’s lawyer, Jean Aittouares, says Koons’s work is a “servile copy.”  “It’s the same work in three dimensions, to which Jeff Koons added flowers, and two penguins [sic] to evoke the cold, which aims to stick to the original work.” Aittouares told the newspaper. “He completes the plagiarism by giving his work the same title as the advert, Fait d’Hiver.“  The title, which translates to “fact of winter,” is a homonym of the French “fait divers,” meaning a short news item.   Fait d’Hiver by US artist Jeff Koons at Christie’s auction house is seen before going on sale for an estimated $4-6 million in New York on November 12, 2007.

The suit had been ongoing since December 2014, when Davidovici first became aware of Koons’s sculpture ahead of a retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. It was shown as part of his “Banality” series, for which the artist created sculptures from kitsch items, scenes from advertisements, and other copyrighted material.  At the time, the Pompidou’s then-president Alain Seban defended Koons’s work. “The whole point is to work from commercially purchased objects or images that come from advertising or magazines,” Seban said. Despite Seban’s support, however, the sculpture’s lender pulled the work from the show amid the controversy.  One edition of Fait d’Hiver sold for $4.3 million at Christie’s New York in 2007. It is now in the collection of the Prada Foundation. (There are three editions of the work in total, plus an artist’s proof.)  This is not the first complaint lodged at Koons over a sculpture from this series. In fact, a total of five lawsuits have sprung from “Banality”: Koons lost three, while another settled out of court. (Notably, French copyright law is generally not as sympathetic to appropriators and has a stricter definition of “fair use” than US law does.)  The most recent of Koons’s three losses occurred in March 2017, when Paris’s High Court ruled in favor of the estate of the French photographer Jean-François Bauret, who took a photograph of two children that formed the basis of Koons’s sculpture Naked. The court stated that Jeff Koons LLC and the Centre Pompidou, where the work was shown, would need to pay damages.    Follow artnet News on Facebook:    Want to stay ahead of the art world?

Conceptual art can never capture the tragedy of the Great War ,"our years of official remembering reach their climax on Sunday at the Cenotaph and at humbler memorials all across the United Kingdom. In London Prince Charles will lay the wreath, the Queen will watch from the balcony of the Foreign Office, and the band will lead the parade with its jaunty selection of first world war songs. Big Ben will ring out once again to mark the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, and the end of a war that has had a tighter grip on Britain’s cultural (though not political) imagination than any other. But as we come to the end of the centenary commemorations, I wonder how much they have changed or enlarged our understanding of this great catastrophe.   Poppies sculptures to be installed in London and Manchester  Read more I am old enough to know a time when the Great War was an everyday memory. One or two of my secondary schoolteachers had fought in it; sometimes I reckon up the years in surprise – a man born, say, in 1895, could have served in the trenches and still been a few years from retirement when I sat in his class to learn chemistry. My maternal grandfather, a sniper with the Royal Scots, was wounded in Flanders, while a paternal great-uncle, a company sergeant major in the same regiment, died at Passchendaele. Other great-uncles on my mother’s side, whom my mother was too young to remember much about, were included among the dead on a nearby town’s memorial.  This is a common enough story. My grandfather would speak wryly but briefly about his experience on the western front, while my father would talk fondly of his sergeant major uncle, who did daring things such as leaping from a slowing train before it reached the station so that he could run down the embankment and be quicker home for his tea.  I knew of the Great War from these anecdotes and also from a few keepsakes in the house: a Glengarry cap and a tattered book of Bruce Bairnsfather’s cartoons (“Well, if you knows of a better ‘ole, go to it!”). Gen Douglas Haig was hated; because armistice poppies were produced in his name, we never wore any. But only with the coming of Joan Littlewood’s musical Oh! What a Lovely War and the BBC series marking its 50th anniversary did the war assume a clearer shape in the eyes of a generation born nearly 30 years after it had ended, whose childhoods were marked by its successor conflict and the Dambusters rather than the film of All Quiet on the Western Front.  This was the shape we still know: the war as a tragedy that ended or ruined millions of lives. It was easier then to keep this idea alive because so many survivors of the actuality still lived among us – though long before the last of them disappeared, in 2009, the old rituals had begun to seem emptier and timeworn. The 100th anniversary needed new ways to stimulate public interest, and it found them by turning commemoration into a more artful experience, liberating it from the confines of the little crowd that surrounded the local war memorial on a November morning or the marching-band patriotism of the British Legion show at the Albert Hall.   Guardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you  Read more The spectacle of the multitude arrived in 2014. Possibly inspired by Ai Weiwei’s installation of millions of porcelain sunflower seeds at the Tate Modern four years before, the ceramic artist Paul Cummins and a team of assistants planted the moat of the Tower of London with 888,246 ceramic red poppies, each flower to represent a life lost in the conflict by Britain and its colonies. The installation was a tremendous popular success – over four months, more than 5 million people are thought to have visited it – and now the war’s end is being marked by several examples of the similarly multitudinous.  At Ypres 600,000 little clay figures have been spread densely across open land to mark the war’s victims on Belgian territory. At the Tower of London the moat has been filled with 10,000 burning torches, which are lit one by one every night to the sound of choral music. And at Stratford, in east London, 72,396 shrouded plastic dolls stretch out on a strip of the Olympic park to represent the British and Commonwealth soldiers who died at the Somme and have no known grave.  I don’t know about Ypres, but this week I went to the displays at Stratford and the Tower and found they touched nothing in me. Shrouds of the Somme is an odd idea made odder by the sale of more shrouded dolls in the gift shop – £75 in a frame and £35 in a box, where they lay as if intended to encourage little children to play with the dead. At the Tower, marshals in hi-vis jackets organised large crowds into winding queues that shuffled slowly through the dark towards the lights and the music. Earlier in the week I saw Peter Jackson’s film They Shall Not Grow Old, his marvellous restoration of footage from the trenches, and found it a thousand times more moving.  In fact, more moving and informative things are everywhere present and everywhere forgotten. The people hurrying towards the Tower strode past the memorial to merchant seamen that spreads across Tower Hill; and, so far as I could tell from five minutes’ observation, not one of them paused to look at its bronze plaques, which list the dead by ship they sailed in (“Athenia, Glasgow; Ausonia, Liverpool”) under a general dedication to the 12,000 sailors of the Great War “who have no other grave but the sea”.  At Liverpool Street station, the memorial to the dead of the Great Eastern Railway was likewise ignored. I sought it out on my way from Stratford and discovered something beneath it I had never noticed before: a bronze relief of Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, the chief of the imperial general staff at the war’s end, who according to the inscription had died on 22 June 1922 “within two hours of his unveiling the adjoining memorial”. What the inscription didn’t say was that two IRA men had shot him outside his house in Eaton Place as he left the taxi that had taken him from the ceremony. His assassins were quickly captured, and on the day two months later when they were hanged Wilson’s big house in County Longford was burned to the ground. He had always considered himself an Irishman as well as a unionist.  The memorial that owes its inspiration to conceptual art can never reflect such complexity, nor is that its intention. But even at the level of the big, bold statement it suffers by comparison with its precedents. What could be more disturbing or multitudinous than the apparently endless ranks of real graves in Flanders?  What, as an event that involves you, could be better than to visit the Field of Remembrance outside Westminster Abbey, and there give some money and in return take a cross or some other religious or secular remembrance and write the deceased’s name on it, and then borrow a mallet and drive the little piece of wood softly into the piece of lawn that has been reserved for his military unit or regiment?  I have done this occasionally in memory of my great-uncle, the company sergeant major, and did it again on Thursday. As the field was a stunt invented by Earl Haig’s poppy factory in 1928, my little ceremony flies in the face of family prejudice and I never feel completely at ease. This year I noticed that the Royal Scots plot was filled to the brim and looked as neat and crowded as a miniature version of those white cemeteries across the Channel. Conceptual art before the term was invented, and no art involved, thank God.  • Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist  Since you’re here … … we have a small favour to ask.

 Artist Laurent Durieux Breaks Down Every Poster in His New Mondo Show,"Laurent Durieux belongs on the short list of the best pop culture artists working today. His classical style, his subtle wit, and his attention to detail lead to posters that are often astonishing to behold.  Austin’s Mondo Gallery is playing host to Durieux’s latest gallery show, titled “The Art of Laurent Durieux Part Two”, which opens today and runs through November 17. We got in touch with Durieux and he supplied us with the inspirations behind and origins of every print on display and for sale at the show, including posters for Planet of the Apes, Ghostbusters, Apocalypse Now, The Shining, and more.      Conan the Barbarian “It was first a commission from Milan Records France, whom I had worked with before for Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence and Oldboy soundtracks LP artworks. It’s also one of the first, if not the first movie I watched in a theater as a kid and it left a great impression on me. I was scared that when I had to re-watch it to do the poster, the movie would have aged badly, but it really didn’t. It was just as awesome for a 48 year old guy as it was for an 11 year old boy.”     Planet of the Apes “Believe it or not, as a kid, I collected the Planet of the Apes figurines. The TV shows were very popular in Europe in the late ’70s. So when I was asked to chose the movies, choosing POTA was a no-brainer to me. I had to do it. I re-watched it again, and just like Conan, it is still as great a movie today as it was 40 years ago.”    Ex Machina “This movie is in my top five best science fiction movies of all time (along with Blade Runner, Alien, Gattaca and Star Wars). The scenario is perfect – everything in this movie is just first rate. I think it will be regarded as a masterpiece of anticipation fiction (like Netflix’s Black Mirror) in a few years. The idea for my poster was to illustrate the fact that Caleb found himself prisoner of Ava’s manipulative intelligence. Like we could all be very soon with AI…or aren’t we already?”    Ghostbusters “I was done with my show and Mondo’s Mitch Putnam contacted me to see if we could add a true geek film to the list. So I did it. It’s always a personal challenge for me to tackle movies that are so popular you would almost choke. It’s not my favourite movie as it is, I’m sure, for many younger folks, but it’s pretty cool and it does remind me of my teenage years way back when.”     The Shining “I don’t usually like horror movies, but here, it’s so much more than that. What could I say? Kubrick’s masterpiece of horror is a genuine masterpiece indeed. Its one of those you can watch a hundred times and discover new things, new details you hadn’t noticed before. There are so many layers on this film, that I think I could have made 10 different posters for it. The typewriter/axe project was originally done as a concept sketch for one of my fans who attended either MondoCon or ThoughtBubble in Leeds and I always loved it. There are quite a lot of existing projects with the typewriter out there, but I somehow managed to come up with something no one had thought of before.”    The Shining “Here is an iconic sequence from the film. I couldn’t really do anything for The Shining and not use this scene. The image without the door of Room 237 hidden on the tricycle back seat wouldn’t be interesting at all. I’m not sure people will see the idea straight away, but just like my Jaws poster, it’s hiding in plain view.”    Apocalypse Now “Three years ago, I was contacted by Francis Ford Coppola’s collaborator to ask me if I would be interested in designing/creating the visual for a steel box edition of the film. I had to turn down the offer as my schedule wasn’t allowing me to do it and told them that they probably would have to wait a couple of years before I could get to it. I was expecting them to tell me, “Well, okay, we’ll find someone else who could do it for us quicker”, but to my surprise, they said “Mr. Coppola will wait.” Apparently, Francis didn’t want anyone else but me to tackle his masterpiece of a film. What an honor!”     Apocalypse Now   Titanic “This was a convention sketch commission done during Thought Bubble in Leeds. I showed it to Eric Garza right then and asked if they could get the license for it, as there are plenty of Titanic fans out there. You know who you are. Yes, you there with the badass tattoos! I love the movie, period. I thought the idea was pretty cool and witty. That’s our job as creators to bring new interpretations on films.”    Mystery Train “This was originally commissioned by Milan Records France to design the artwork for the LP/CD soundtrack. I had never seen the movie before that and I loved it! Steve Buscemi alone was a good reason enough for me to do it. I love the atmosphere of this film and love the director, Jim Jarmusch. Mystery Train is one of those films that stay with you for many years after you’ve watched it.”    Elevator to the Gallows “This image was originally commissioned by Milan Records France for a fantastic re-edtion of the Miles Davis soundtrack to Elevator to the Gallows. I had this perfect idea with the jacket cover and dust jacket, but this will never happen as the folks at Milan told me (way too late when the art was finished) that they didn’t get the license to publish it after all. Being my favorite piece of the lot, I just couldn’t bring myself to not print it or show it to people. So Mondo was very happy to make it available as an art print and that’s awesome! I LOVE THIS FILM NOIR MOVIE! If you have never watched it, please do yourself a favor.”             Tucker: The Man and His Dream “I have a passion for vintage cars, even moreso for vintage cars that has a retro-futuristic look. I first saw this movie when it came out in the late ’80s and loved it. Martin Landau has one of his best roles ever, if you ask me. I’m not even going to talk about Jeff Bridges who is, like in all of his movies, great! This poster/image was originally commissioned by Francis Ford Coppola’s winery, as they wanted it for their Director’s Series wine label.”  ***  “The Art of Laurent Durieux Part Two” is open to the public at the Mondo Gallery, located at 4115 Guadalupe Street in Austin, Texas. Posters that don’t sell out during the gallery’s initial run will go on sale online at a later date.",ENTERTAINMENT,Real
