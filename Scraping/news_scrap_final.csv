South Delhi businessman SK Khurana, though hesitant initially, did agree that these things are common in Delhi and media shouldn’t overreact. “Why is that Arnab behaving like a rabid mongrel over this issue. If he hadn’t brandished the weapon then it would have been a national crisis,” he said.
“I remember once I had an argument with a man after he cut me in traffic. We were talking like gentlemen and sorting the issue when some bystanders got restless and asked when are we going to start fighting. They were not happy with our politeness and wanted to hear some cuss words,” he recollected.
A senior bureaucrat, while commenting in the incident said that people coming from outside should respect the culture of Delhi. “Please liberally flaunt your political connections. Invest in a gun if you can afford it, especially the high society types. Carry a baseball bat in you car to start a road rage without provocation. In fact car dealers should give baseball bats as standard accessory,” he suggested.",INDIA

Bengaluru couple going for a weekend outing returns after spending quality time at different traffic signals,"Bengaluru: Prakash and Rita, returned from their weekend trip after spending quality hours at different traffic bottlenecks inside the city.
Prakash who has spent more time with Silk Board signal than with his wife Rita wanted to surprise her on their first anniversary. Alas, city traffic had some other plan.
The blame game started between the two after they realized, forget about the outing, it will be a struggle to catch their Monday morning office cab.   
“I could have taken her to a nearby bowling alley, could have cut a love shaped strawberry cake along with candlelight dinner. Yeh toh koi bhi kar sakta tha. Wanted to try something different,” said Prakash.
He added, “What was the reason for Rita to try all those outfits, do so much makeup. 2 AM (when we started) ko kaun check karta hai road pe tum kaisi dikh rahe ho. Yeh baar baar gaadi stop karke, selfie leke social media mein upload karne ka bimari, that’s what spoiled our plan”.
Rita has a different take, “My friends had warned me, two days is not sufficient to get out of Whitefield only.  Why did Prakash plan a trip like this? Mein toh yahan abhi abhi aayee hoon, he is staying here for last eight years”.
Though the couple did not anticipate the traffic correctly, their friends, colleagues and well-wishers staying in the city knew where they would be looking at Rita’s social media updates. They ‘correctly’ sent the couple bouquet, gifts marking the major signals as their address.
Disheartened Prakash and Rita while returning met their neighbors leaving for their home town in Tamil Nadu near their residence. To Prakash’s query “Are you going for Dussehra?” Neighbours replied, “Kaun kambakht hai jo dusshra ke liye abhi niklega, hum toh nikle hain ki, Diwali tak ghar pahunch sakke”.",INDIA

My family was angry with me for having spent spent so much money. But after I managed to sell theplas and khakras worth a lakh, they are happy.

Oyo Rooms starts listing 'Dalit homes' for politicians who want to visit Dalits as elections approach,"Mumbai: OYO rooms which are the biggest online hotel and accommodation marketplace in India, yesterday came up with a great idea to solve the problems Politicians are facing. With elections scheduled in some big states and also the Lok Sabha elections of 2019 approaching fast, Oyo Rooms is providing homes where Dalits stay, for politicians to select a suitable home and pay a visit.
Last year there was a tremendous increase in no of politicians visiting Dalits and other people of scheduled caste and tribe. Amit Shah, Rahul Gandhi, and leaders from smaller parties never miss a chance to visit such places to get the sympathy vote from the voters.
With some big states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan going to polls in the coming months, politicians have little time in finding out which places to visit so Oyo has made the listing for them to pick and choose from the given options. OYO is also running an offer where if you visit a home of a Dalit, your visit to the home of another Dalit is free. so it is a one plus one offer, which small politicians can use as the bigger one doesn’t have a shortage of money or resources.
Looking at OYO, other players like zostel have also started ideating about the type of listings they can provide to attract more politicians.",INDIA
Buzzfeed writer who wrote '7 ways to keep relation' gets dumped by girlfriend for spending too much time in Article writing,"Mumbai: Oh, BuzzFeed. Sure, the website churns out some quality pieces. However, their clickbait headlines are an ongoing internet joke. Their ability to turn everything into a “top 10” list is extraordinary. Sometimes we don’t even have knowledge about kind of items they include in their lists. ‘7 ways to find if your GF is cheating on you’, ‘ 8 signs of you being in love’ and many more.
Harneet Ahuja has been a Buzzfeed writer for years and has continuously churned out some interesting lists. His last titled ‘9 ways to ask for pocket money’ went viral and parents almost filed a case against him. Harneet is a brave writer, a category which is seeing its number going down and down. He again created a buzz on Saturday with his article ‘7 ways to keep your job’. This time though, the article didn’t strike a chord with the youth which is already aware of ways to keep their job and work towards a brighter future. It didn’t stop at that, as Harneet had to let go his own job after his boss fired him for the lack of engagement on his piece. It is shocking to learn that even after knowing the 7 ways to keep one’s job, Harneet himself forgot to apply those principles in real life. Harneet’s loss has opened the eyes of many other aspiring writers as they are clear now that what matters in the industry is the ‘NO OF LIKES’ on the article and not the quality.
My request to all readers would be to please like, share and comment on the Facebook post of this article and help me save my job.",INDIA
Rajnath Singh: People who make musical.ly videos will be given preference for a job as they require it badly,"New Delhi: Launched in 2014, musical.ly’s popularity has been increasing ever since. The app allows users to create videos of their choice using various filters and speed options. It hasn’t even been a year since musical.ly was launched in India and it already has more than 15 million registered users. Youngsters are spending so much time on the app that they don’t care whether they need a structured career or a job. The types of videos doing the rounds make one believe that they are shot by people having too much time on their hands.
But every negative aspect comes up with a blessing in disguise. The musicaly.ly registration number is helping the government to find out the unemployment rate in India and to track its behavior. From lip-syncing, vines, to dancing, stand-up comedy, and makeup videos, musical.ly has a huge pool of talent. Govt now wants to use the database to make sure that a person is actually jobless before granting him a mainstream govt job. The new process would demand the fresher candidate to show 2-3 videos recorded on the Musical.ly app to prove that currently he/she is not working anywhere else and are in a true sense the jobless community of India.
It appears that Musical.ly is to the Gen Z what YouTube was to the Gen Y. Even though the most common age group on Musical.ly is 12-25, it is not limited to that. Aged people are also making videos and they should keep making them in fact, because based on the latest government decision, they can, in fact, apply for the role of a fresher for any government vacancy. Musical.ly will soon become the Aadhar card of the job market. Show videos and take a job.",INDIA
Bartender hired by Petrol Station to meet demand for 30 ml and 60 ml petrol by consumers,"Mumbai: A petrol station in Chembur has replaced all its regular staff with bartenders from nearby bars. This has been done after several consumers came asking for really small amount of petrol from the pump operators. With demand dropping to 30 ml and 60 ml, the owner decided that bartenders will be better suited to meet this demand thanks to their expertise in measuring those amounts.
Speaking to Faking News outside his petrol pump, the owner Mr. Telaram said, “With petrol prices crossing 91, people could no longer afford to buy petrol in bulk so they started asking for smaller and smaller amounts. Now the situation is such that they are asking for petrol in millilitres and our machine is not equipped to measure amounts that small. We asked our employees to measure 30-60 ml by hand and give but they always ended up giving more petrol than what the consumer asked for. This was causing a lot of loss for me and I had to find people who can measure millilitres perfectly.”
“Upset with the losses, I went to a bar nearby and that is when this great idea struck me. I saw the bartender pouring exactly 60 ml without even measuring it and I knew he is the solution to all my problems. I immediately got a few more bartenders on board, paid them more than what they were getting, and now I can meet the exact demand of the consumers,” he went on to add.
When we asked if everyone is asking for these small measures of 30 and 60 ml, Telaram ji said ,”Oh no, not everyone is asking for 30 or 60 ml, there are still some daredevils who ask for Patiala Peg of 90 ml.”
Meanwhile, after hearing this news, the government has decided to levy additional tax on petrol to get it to the same level as alcohol. “Any place employing bartenders has to pay the same amount of tax”, a government official said.",INDIA

On receiving the complaint from Shwetank, the e-commerce software sent him 20 more alerts mentioning in detail about what they are doing to resolve his issue.

"Gujarati boy opts for higher education, the father gets his DNA test done","In a bizarre incident, a Gujarati father has asked his son to undergo a DNA test only because the son wanted to go for higher education instead of joining the family business. Gujaratis are famous for making money from almost everything that exists and for that matter they do not need any qualification as heredity bestows them with the right skills.

Techie who wanted to tune himself for ‘Big Data” project buys a carton box of cigarette packets,"Bengaluru: Techie Prakash Joseph is too excited about the new Big Data project that came his way. He did not want to leave any stone unturned in his preparation to tune himself for the big project.
For his breakfast, lunch and snacks instead of buying a packet, he bought a carton box of cigarette packets and kept it in his car’s dickie.
“After spending five years in bench, I would have taken a project where they ask an IITian to use all his skills to measure whether the margin in the printout has come exactly same as set in the word file”, said Prakash.
Prakash got a project where the final party happens in the client office in Trump land. Seniors have done multiple night outs to bookmark all the sites through google, from where freshly graduated from bench engineers like Prakash have to just copy and paste while ogling at cricinfo highlights
“Only thing in return project seniors expect from us is to accompany them for their four dozen soota breaks they take in a day. Smile and listen to their unlimited gaalis they give to our manager without which our days will feel like a quarter day”, said Prakash.
Prakash’s big obsession in everything has created some issues for his family members. “Yesterday I told him to fill petrol in our car. He has made the tank full, in the process we lost our family savings. Now I am sleeping in the car only, because the wealth inside car is much more than what is inside my house”, said his Papa

"To cut costs, Yash Raj Films to shoot movie close to Bellandur lake in Bengaluru to recreate Switzerland like snow","For the first time since inception, Yash Raj Films has decided that its next movie will not have any scene shot in Switzerland. Instead the snow capped mountains would be recreated in Bengaluru’s Bellandur lake.
The lake which has been frothing for quite some time now has caught the attention of film makers on several occasions previously but for the first time it will be used as a backdrop for any movie.
Apparently, a team from Yash Raj visited the lake and was left impressed with 10 feet high foam. “With rupee weakening in the global market, shooting at foreign locations has become expensive. Switzerland was out of question for our next movie so we narrowed down on Bellandur lake. And let me tell you, it’s as good as the real Swiss snow. Viewers wont be able to tell the difference,” said a senior YRF executive.
Not just YRF, Hollywood movie productions studios too are scouting for locations around Bellandur lake. Locals residents say they have spotted crew of Marvel studios hanging around the lake, fanning speculations that the next Avengers movie could be shot near the lake.
Bengaluru Municipal Corporation in its press release took credit for the global recognition that the lake is receiving.” Its a tough job to maintain the froth levels in the lake. At times these activists make our job difficult, but our workers are doing their best to ensure that the mountain of foam keeps growing each day,” said a senior official.
The Corporation has plans to promote Bellandur lake as a tourism spot and thereby attract tourists in the state.",INDIA
Ex vacates room of woman's heart after 7 years,"In an unexpected but long awaited turn of events, Woman’s ex finally vacated the room of her heart. In other words, she got over her high school ex boyfriend 7 years after high school ended. On Monday morning, she woke up feeling no feelings whatsoever for the guy she dated for all of 6 months.
Friends report that they didn’t notice any warning signs leading up to the event. They claim, even the degradation of her ex’s social media posting habits into that of an inspirational quote posting baby boomer hadn’t perturbed her.
BFF #2 (name hidden to lend anonymity) informed us, “She kept mentioning him once every few months in conversations, so I knew she was still closely monitoring his activities”. Despite the understandable abandonment of hope, BFF #2 would listen patiently and try to make relevant comments. She now wonders what had lacked in her consolation that it took Woman so long to recover.
Some friends, however, were in a celebratory mood. BFF #1 (name hidden to lend anonymity) wanted to thank the authorities in Woman’s brain, “I’m grateful to the SWAT cell in her brain that swatted her ex out of there. I didn’t think it was going to happen, but they came through.”
Woman’s new friend from her aerial yoga class isn’t very optimistic though. She worries, “Her last two crushes were already in relationships. She now has no other guy to focus her romantic feelings towards. And we all know that having no man in your life isn’t allowed by the laws of physics.”
According to every religious text ever written by single, old, men it is impossible for the room of a woman’s heart to be devoid of a man post puberty. Experts agree, “This is an unprecedented situation. We can now only wait and watch how things pan out.”
Woman’s family and friends are now waiting with bated breath and numerous social media accounts, ready to do a background check on whichever primate Woman lays her eyes upon.",INDIA
When Mahatma Gandhi got up from his Samadhi on his birth anniversary,"India recently celebrated 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The day of 2nd October 1969.  The whole world remembers his ideas, philosophy of his life, ethics & his experiments on truth. In fact,this day is celebrated as International day of non-violence. However, the western world is deeply studying his philosophy of life. They are the real admirer of his life. Anyhow, they have the great respect for him.
But, few of the Indian people abuse him. It’s because they are ignorant. The people of Pakistan also abuse him. They say, he was Hindu leader. Because, these people have not dived into the life of Gandhi. Really, he was not in favor of two nation theory.  The Indian people accepts an idea or a fact only when it is accepted by the west. Therefore, it seems that the Indians are now trying to accept his philosophy.
Mahatma Gandhi gets up from his Samadhi.
Mahatma accompanies his friend, Anna Hazare. Says, Anna, you are my friend. However, I wish to see my India.
The Indian Parliament.
All members of Lok – Sabha are celebrating. They are happy. Bapu inquires, why are they celebrating? Anna says, Bapu, thirty percent of the members are having criminal background. Some, yet to be prosecuted. The Supreme Court denies to make any law regarding this. Thus, the court ask them to make such law themselves. Therefore, they are happy with the verdict. Besides that, Bapu, 80 percent of them are rich persons & enjoying the luxurious.
Anna adds. At the time of elections, there is horse trading. There is no morality & ideology. They change the party every now & than. For money & for the post.Of course, sometimes votes are en-cashed.
Few of the leaders may be doing well. Only, few have the moral values. They are less in numbers.
The most remarkable verdict of the court.
Bapu, a great decision by the court. The Supreme Court judge say, there is nothing wrong in extra marital affair or relationships.Illegal relationships are now legal!
Mahatma’s Reaction.
Gandhi is now angry. He is furious. What about our culture? Our society? What about our reach heritage? Thus,he runs towards his Samadhi. Says, Anna do something, if you can. I do not want to stay here.
Anna cannot decide anything. Because, there are number of problems. Where to start. Someone may once again make use Anna to become a political leader.",INDIA
Who should pay for destination wedding?,"After giving out commendable judgements in a series of important cases, the apex court has before it yet another crucial case. The question that is keeping thousands of millennials in guessing game is “Who pays for the travel arrangements in a destination wedding”? Is your inviter your sponsor or do you split the expenses? If you split then in what percentage and is GST split too? The case acquired a newly found importance after hundreds of weddings ended up souring more relations than creating new ones. While initially the matter was being resolved with mutual consensus, the lack of clear directive is leading to escalating chaos. On one side are hundreds of relatives, silent but grumpier with every phone call, waiting for their travel bills to be reimbursed. On other hand are wedding sponsors who, much to their shock and surprise, find themselves sponsoring much more.
In a historical Inviter vs Invitee 2018 case, the court will pronounce its verdict to an otherwise empty courtroom which will be live streamed to record number of viewers online. The case will reviewed by a bench consisting of 22 members after two of the judges were found to have conflict of interest. A few involved parties were available to express their grievances. One of the relatives said “we had to book expensive tickets on such short notice. When there was no formal expression of reimbursement, we thought it will be covered with baraat pithiya”. “However that amount was not enough even for the ride to airport”, he fumed.
Meanwhile the wedding sponsors too had their share of complains. ”With all these expenses of pre wedding shoots and arrangements in such remote places, we hoped relatives will support us financially. However their response was quite opposite. One of them put his travel bills and UPI id in the envelope handed to bride”. The case is also unique considering the breadth of judgements it has to give. Apart from the conventional inviter vs invitee, it has to settle expense distribution between bride and groom’s family and in some instances between the groom and his family. Although less severe, there are requests to give similar financial guidelines for bachelor party.
Considering how well the court has given judgements in matters of public interest in the past, everyone is expecting a sound fiscal strategy. The finance ministry could take a cue from it considering the circumstances.",INDIA

They have praised BBMP for being so innovative and proactive.

Family compelled me to buy groceries and vegetables from Reliance Fresh with no option: Son,"New Delhi: Local man has come forward alleging his family of compelling him to buy everything from Reliance Fresh store. Yashjit Patel, 28, confirmed to our reporters, “Yes it is absolute truth. My whole family made me buy all groceries and vegetables from Reliance Fresh store. I tried to buy those thing from somewhere but they wouldn’t allow me to do so.”
Yashjit continued in helpless tone, “It is me who do all the buying stuff for home so I should be able to decide from where to buy. But I am never given such opportunity. There are many other convenience stores nearby our place.
There is D-mart, Spencer’s, Foodworld and many other small retailer shops. But I am categorically asked by my family to choose Reliance Fresh.”
He added with little bit of irritation in voice, “I am a free person and I work as software engineer. My family should give me freedom to shop from anywhere. Why is their love dependent on convenience store from where I buy? Is this true love and free market? I guess it is absolutely not.”
He confined to our reporter like a professional whistleblower, “I think my family has a close family friend in Reliance Fresh working managerial staff. I don’t know full extent of the nexus but there is definitely at least one family friend working in Reliance Fresh.”
When contacted by our reporters, key members of his family denied all allegations. As one member adds, “Yashjit is free person and he is free to buy his apples or spinach or rice or anything else from any shop he wishes. There is no pressure of any kind.”",INDIA

REASONS OF SUICIDE
The lioness says, “The main culprit responsible for the suicide is the animal with two legs. The homo sapien, also known as man. This homo sapien is dangerous. He is greedy, cunning, wicked & over smart. He has made our lives miserable. Therefore, our survival is now difficult. Thus, she then adds how he is dangerous.
INCREASE IN POPULATION OF HOMO SAPIENS
Due to the over population, the man is now moving towards forest area. Day by day, our area decreases. Therefore, we move towards villages. For water & food. Therefore, there is a direct conflict between us & the man. The man kills us. He sells our body parts. Thus, he earns lacks of rupees. But, sometimes, they catch us & send us to the city jails. They call it zoo. Thus, our lives become horrible.
THE WELLS IN THE FOREST AREAS
The man digs wells here & there for water. Our cubs & even elders falls into the wells & thus dies.
ELECTRIC SHOCKS
The homo sapien is a cunning man. He has the electric wires here & there in the farms.  Therefore, our families dies due to electric shocks.
ACCIDENTS ON THE ROADS
Our territory is very much limited now. The wicked man is responsible for deforestation. We sometimes, move towards the road side for roaming. We & our cubs dies in accidents.
PROBLEMS OF DRINKING WATER
The uncivilized homo sapien is continuously destroying the nature. There is no water in rivers now. If, it is there, it is un- clean. It contains carcinogenic chemicals.
BATTLE OVER THE TERRITORY
Our area is now limited. Therefore, sometimes, there is a fighting for the territory. For this problem also, the homo is responsible.
The chief conservator says, the death of big cats is due to infection. It’s wrong. It’s really a suicide.
The homo sapien should learn to control population. At least from us.
The man makes fun of us. Moreover, sometimes shoot us for fun.

The new education policy: A step towards world class universities,"From reliable sources – New Delhi.
The HRD minister, Prakash Javadekar announces a new education policy for Higher Education.  This policy will improve the higher education. Moreover, It will  also make our universities world class.
The salient features of the new policy includes:
The college teachers  should not waste their time doing research. In fact, there is no need of such research.( Compare with Oxford Uni.!)
The teachers must encourage the students to participate in other activities.Therefore,they should take maximum interest in various Mahostav. Such as Navratri-GARBA, Ganesh Mahotsav, Durga puja etc.Therefore, we should declare holidays in these days.
This policy also focuses on online education. Private universities & self-finance colleges are also encouraged.However,in few years,  government is going to convert all institutions into private sector.
The appointment of vice-chancellor.
The chief minister will monitor the appointment of vice chancellors.
.The students and teachers.
They must remain present as an audience in functions. Whenever needs be. Because, this will show strength of the political party.
Most of the politicians & the ministers run their own self-finance colleges. But, they do not have prestigious degrees. There is already a provision for such an Institute. This is known as “Smruti Irani Institute of Doctorates”. Thus, it awards degrees to these needy people. Only in six or seven days time. In addition, We are starting more such short term courses. These will award B.A., B.Com. Etc.
In addition,the minister finally says. “No student should fail in any of the examination. It is the duty of the teachers to see it”.
The teachers and the students who were present in the function gives a big applaud.They all welcome the reforms.

Beggar shares Aadhaar number hoping for one rupee from hackers,"Ram Sewak Sharma, the TRAI chief recently shared his Aadhaar number on twitter. Little did he expect such an act would snowball into a major controversy. Privacy activists deplored the move. Aadhaar critics claimed all his details have become public. Some hackers with mischief on their mind sent one rupee to his account through the pay to Aadhaar feature using UPI (Unified Payment Interface) apps. A beggar here in Bengaluru who was a mute spectator, to all this bickering, was inspired.
With 99% adults in India having the Aadhaar, It was no surprise Mr. Siraj Khan a beggar by profession had it too. With the government emphasizing on opening Jan Dhan Accounts for the poor, Siraj too opened an account in a bank near his slum dwelling. When he heard about the controversy about the sharing of Aadhaar number, he did not bother too much. After a few days, when the controversy seemed to subside, he heard something which was startling.
A life of Penury
Like all beggars Siraj lives by the road side, begging for food and alms. On days when people are benevolent he earns as much as 150 rupees. “It is not all rosy begging” He says. There are lean days too when he finds it difficult to make ends meet. It was always his dream to lead a comfortable life. Stricken with polio since his childhood, his right leg had been affected. He uses a wooden pole as support to stand. Unlettered and leading a life in the periphery, all he wanted to do was live a life with dignity.
Siraj knew the importance of identity proof and always carried a duplicate copy of his aadhaar with him. It is helpful when he has to deal with the police he says. A beggar like him who does not live within the confines of four walls cannot be expected to comprehend what privacy meant. When he heard that some people deposited one rupee in the account of Shri. Sharma ji, he knew he had discovered something worthy. He dreamt of not having to beg yet earning from people.
Modern Begging through Aadhaar
It wasn’t time yet for him to be able to share his Aadhaar, though. He says no one told him we can beg this way. He had to come up with a novel way of sharing his Aadhaar in such a way, people would instantly get to know he was a beggar and in need. After mulling all options he decided to get a placard made with his Aadhaar complete with a logo displayed prominently. He is a happy man now. Any Aadhaar critic or hacker who sees his placard does not leave him empty handed.",INDIA

Corporates revamp Separation Portal due to Petrol Prices,"India: Corporates revamp Separation Portal due to petrol price rise. Recent petrol price rise has affected various strata of society. Corporate sector has reported upward trend in attrition numbers.
Our reporters reached out to one of the leading company; here are the updates on how corporates are preparing to deal with the changes coming up in ‘Developed India’.
We spoke to the HR person who had just completed his major project of Independence Day celebration.

We are hoping that the trick will work this time too.”",INDIA
"Supreme Court allows protests in Aeroplanes, but only during take-off and landing.","Prashant Bhushan, the man who made his career successful out of PILs had once again knocked on the doors of Supreme Court yesterday night.
As the learned lawyer personally called five senior most judges requesting an urgent hearing to avoid a constitutional crisis, all Judges assembled at the court in the wee hours of today.
Trying hard to hide his annoyance over being woken at the middle of the night, CJI asked Mr Bhushan, what the crisis was.
“The Constitution, that is fundamental foundation to our country is in danger, MeLord”, Mr Bhushan made a grand opening statement, beaming into the television camera of NDTV. “The Tamilnadu government, which is a stooge to the fascist BJP ruled Central government is closing down all the vents of Democracy. The Democracy in India is throttled and is gasping to breathe”.
CJI: Will you please stop the theatrics and talking in circles please. Come to the point and tell us what the problem was.
PB: Sofia Lois, one poor Tamil student belonging to minority community studying in Canada started venting out her frustration when she saw ‘Tamilisai Soundararajan’ president of fascist BJP’s state unit in the same aeroplane she was travelling to Tuticorin.   She expressed her dissent by shouting “Down with Modi, BJP-RSS fascist government”. Instead of appreciating the research scholar’s attempt to keep the noble symptoms of Democracy alive, Tamilisai complained against the young leader Sofia Lois.
CJI: So?
PB: Immediately after the plane landed, police arrested the innocent research scholar only because this girl from minority community raised slogans against the ‘fascist’ BJP government.
CJI turned to the Attorney General who tried to smile but failed miserably.
AG: Me Lord, Aeroplane is not Jantar-Mantar to shout and protest against any fellow passengers. What she said and whether it was for or against any person or government is not relevant to this case. The police are bound by the law to file a case against her and their action was validated by the court, when the girl was sent to remand. Of course, she got bail later, as per the law.
PB: I object your honour. The Accountant General, who receives his salary from this fascist government is behaving like a caged parrot repeating the lies spread by the BJP.
CJI: He is Attorney General, Not Accountant General. Even my salary is paid by the same government. Do you call me also a stooge?
PB shocked and was at loss of words. Before he replied, CJI asked him “What exactly you do want from this court?”
PB: A ruling from you that protests are allowed inside the aeroplane Me Lord. Only to prevent further misuse of law and arrest innocent female, minority scholars.
CJI: Do you think protests inside aeroplane should be allowed?
PB: Your honour, you only said that dissent is an essential vent in democracy.
CJI: So, you inferred my statement that everyone can protest anywhere?
PB: Not anywhere and everywhere me Lord. Only inside aeroplanes.
CJI inhaled deeply and sighed before pronouncing the judgement.
Ruling:
Hereby it is proclaimed that inside the aeroplane protests are allowed subject to following conditions.
One can only protest during take-off or landing. One shall inform the flight attendants his or her intention to protest so they can tie the hands backsides.
If the flight is taking off, protestor shall stand near the cockpit facing front. If the flight is landing, protestor shall stand between the loos at the back, facing the tail of the plane.
While protesting, the protester shall not fall down.
If the protestor falls, fine of ₹ One Lac be levied, which would be credited into the PM’s relief fund.
If the protestor sustained any injuries because of such falls during protests inside aeroplane, no relief from insurance company (even from personal medical policies) be provided.
Prashant Bhushan immediately ran to the podium saying “Objection Me Lord. You are simply scuttling the voices. I protest this judgement”
CJI turns to the police standing nearby and says “Take him into custody and send him to 15 days police remand”. Then CJI turns to Prashant Bhushan and says “Advocate Bhushan. I allowed protests only inside aeroplanes. Not inside Court Rooms. You may argue further when the police present you to magistrate tomorrow afternoon. Till then, Bye”.",INDIA
Woman who shifted from Delhi to Mumbai gains 5kgs in 5 days after not having to run due to eve teasing,"Mumbai: As compared to Mumbai and Kolkata where citizens sharply react to any incident of molestation or eve-teasing, such reactions are totally lacking or missing on the part of citizens of Delhi who have a vital role to play in preventing harassment to the women traveling in the city. A live example has come to our notice yesterday.
A woman, who had shifted from Delhi to Mumbai a few days back due to work commitments found out that she had gained 5 kgs in 5 days without even changing any dietary habits or any weather conditions.
Priyanka Ranaut, who works for an MNC shifted to Mumbai 5 days back. And in those 5 days, she never ran away due to any eve teaser harassing her, which was quite common in Delhi. But that scenario had created havoc in her personal life. Gaining 5 kgs in 5 days, she doesn’t where will it all stop.
If the same situation continues, she might gain a lot of weight which will be fatal to health. Many Gyms across the city have sent her their brochure of losing weight in a 30-day challenge or cashback offers.

College withholds Mechanical engineer's degree for being in relationship with a girl,"Mumbai: 10 reasons to fall in love with mechanical engineers – do you know why smart girls prefer dating a mechanical engineer? Mechanical engineers are some of the best people to date with.

Lets come straight to the news. A college in Mumbai actually witholded aMechanical Engineer’s degree as he was dating a girl which is against the traditions of the Mechanical batch.
The news started with Sanil Malik a 4th-year student of Enimity Engineering college. He was dating a girl for the last 2 years, all these in hideouts as he was too embarrassed to tell this to his fellow batchmates. Mechanical Engineers are the Bhisma Pitamah of the current generation, where even talking to a girl is against traditions, parampara as they call it. His act was caught just 2 days before his convocation and he had to speak the truth then as his roaming with the girl was caught on CCTV cameras too. The college had never allowed any student from the mechanical batch to fall in love with a girl.
And Sanil was the latest victim of the tradition-face-off. Sanil has been told to spend one full year in the college living a single life without any relationship as part of the punishment.",INDIA
Govt says that the Dollar will have to find a way to 'Atone' for its 'Alleged Actions' against the Rupee,"New Delhi: The rupee dropped 36 paise to 73.93 against the US currency in early trade Monday, breaking its three-day recovery trend, as crude prices rose amid weak macroeconomic data. A spurt in dollar demand from importers amid sustained foreign fund outflows also weighed on the rupee. The Finance Ministry has said that they are working overtime to ensure that the Rupee comes back to the average level which is acceptable to the economy.
On the allegations that the Dollar has totally overshadowed and molested the Rupee in the recent times, the ministry said that Dollar will find a way to Atone itself for all the alleged actions against the Indian Rupee. In fact, ‘Atone’ and ‘Alleged Actions’ are the favorite words used by people to support any movement nowadays. Farah Khan and Farhan Akhtar used it recently to condemn the Sexual Harassment case against Sajid Khan and many others in the industry as part of the #MeToo movement going on in India.
The Finance ministry led by Arun Jaitley is pretty sure that Dollar will suffer because of the ill-treatment it meted out to the Rupee and whole India is in support with the Rupee right now. On being asked what are the steps his government is taking in this regard, Arun Jaitley said that” The government can’t do anything in this regard and the cycle will take its own due course. The Rupee will have to fight against the Dollar on its own, only then can it become stronger.”",POLITICS
MNS to file Patent for 'Beating up North Indians' after Gujarat copies the model,"Mumbai: After the chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar expressed concerns against the widespread attacks on migrant workers in Gujarat that has sparked an exodus —the situation took another political turn — as the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee has now decided to stage a state-wide protest on Tuesday against the atrocities.
The beating up of North Indians was something new in the state of Gujarat as many migrants work there for years. But now that the violence has happened, MNS, a prominent party in Maharashtra has filed for the patent as they think that ‘beating up north Indians’ is their invention.
MNS will submit proofs in form of photos and videos to the court to prove that they have beaten more north Indians than entire India including Gujarat. Raj Thackeray has asked all his members to increase the violence and defeat Gujarat in this race to become anti-north Indians. According to Raj and his associates, MNS has been beating up North Indians since last 10 years, and Gujarat has just bluntly copied the model without paying any royalty.
Raj Thackeray also believes that it’s not only about the beating up of people, but its also about how well you beat, and what measures you take to make sure that the person and his/her family doesn’t return to the state. The matter is pending with the patent commission to make a decision to whether grant the so-called patent to MNS or not.",POLITICS
Amit Shah reduces his claims of winning 22 seats in WB after Bangladesh gives a close fight to India in the Asia Cup Finals,"BJP President, Amit Shah was seen hesitating when asked about the number of seats he was confident of winning from WB in the upcoming general elections. However, a few days back Amit Shah was quite confident of winning at least 22 seats in WB and had been very vocal about it too. What changed?
Political experts and psephologist believe that Amit Shah has lost the confidence of winning seats only because Bangladesh gave a close fight to India in the recent Asia Cup final.
“There are many Bangladeshis in West Bengal who now have voting rights too and they are not likely to go with BJP since it is too nationalist. Bangladeshis becoming strong and competitive clearly shows that the fight for BJP wouldn’t be as easy as the BJP president was thinking earlier,” said the political expert Pravin Patil.
Although Amit Shah hasn’t cited reasons for his hesitation to commit any numbers now, TMC leader, Mamata Banerjee is sure that the Asia Cup Final has played an important role in diminishing his political ambitions.",POLITICS
Contact Rahul Gandhi to conduct Satyanarayan Katha at your home: Randeep Surjewala,"New Delhi: You can book Congress President Rahul Gandhi to conduct a Satyanarayan Katha soon as per Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala. Speaking to the press at a function earlier today, Mr. Surjewala said that Rahul Gandhi ji is a learned pandit and he will soon start taking bookings for Satyanarayan Katha at people’s homes. Earlier, during Gujarat elections, Mr. Surjewala had revealed that Rahul Gandhi is a janeudhaari Brahmin and a couple of days back he had revealed Brahmin DNA of Congress.
Explaining the decision to enter this line, Mr. Surjewala said, “First of all this will show everyone what a knowledgeable janeudhaari brahmin Rahul Ji is, secondly it will shut those people up who say Rahul Ji hasn’t worked a day in his life. Thirdly, it will increase Rahul Ji’s connection with the people, he will be personally in touch with all the people who will come to attend the katha.”
“Currently he will be doing the katha only in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh because elections are there he is already scheduled to be there to strengthen party base. Anyone from those states can book an appointment via our party website. However, in 2019 we will be accepting bookings from all over the country. The money collected through this service will be given to the lawyers fighting National Herald case party fund,” Mr. Surjewala added.
BJP has already criticized Brahmin DNA comment of Randeep Surjewala and asked for proper forensic analysis of Congress Party to find out the truth behind this claim.

Sambit Patra praises Narendra Modi for reducing Awaragardi on Bikes by increasing Petrol Prices,"New Delhi: BJP spokesperson and news studio resident Sambit Patra has praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for rapidly increasing petrol prices in the country.
As petrol prices crossed 86 Rs mark in Mumbai, Mr. Patra congratulated PM Modi for his hard work towards ensuring safe roads for the Indians. As per Mr. Patra, high petrol prices are keeping hooligans off the roads, making them safer for everyone else.
Speaking at a Press Conference squeezed in his busy schedule of news debates, Mr. Patra said, “A lot of misguided youngsters spend all their time roaming around on their bikes, doing awaragardi, creating ruckus, disrupting traffic, wasting their valuable time instead of studying or looking for a job. Now with increased petrol prices, they just can’t do those things freely any more, they have to worry about the cost of petrol at all times.”
“This has made our roads safer, reduced traffic on the road as people now go out only when they absolutely have to, reduced accidents, even Mumbai roads are starting to look like wide 1 laned highways as people stay away from the roads thanks to the cost of going out in your own vehicle. In fact, I hope our government works harder to ensure petrol reaches new heights every day. This is all a vision of our beloved PM Modi,” Mr. Patra added.
When asked if the government is planning to reduce some of the taxes on petrol to reduce its prices, an irritated Patra said, “I am talking about taking Petrol to new heights and you want to pull it down? And as far as reducing taxes is concerned, aren’t you aware that Mr. Jaitley is back in Finance Ministry? You should have thought of these things when he was away.”",POLITICS
Laloo clears yo-yo test and declares himself fully fit after hearing rumors that he will be shifted to Max Hospital in Delhi,"Patna: Sometime back, the Delhi government revoked the license of the Shalimar Bagh branch of Max Hospital after the corporate medical chain came under fire for wrongly declaring a prematurely delivered infant- packed in a plastic bag, still breathing – dead. Max Hospital has been accused of marking up their treatment cost so much that it is almost impossible for a common man to get treatment there. But one can expect at least the VIPs or the political class to be able to afford such treatment. But we were proved wrong yesterday when Laloo Prasad too fainted hearing the cost of treatment and declared himself fit.
Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president and fodder scam convict Lalu Prasad yesterday surrendered before a CBI court in Ranchi. The Jharkhand High Court had earlier on August 24 rejected Lalu’s bail extension-plea and asked the RJD chief surrender by August 30. But he will be moved to a Ranchi hospital tomorrow which made the court to think that maybe Laloo Prasad is faking illness. So the judge gave orders of Laloo to be shifted to Max hospital in Delhi, whose cost of treatment is world famous.
Recently there was a rumor that a guy walking near the Max Hospital front gate sneezed there and the hospital gave him a bill of 2 lac Rupees. The cost of treating cough, cold and other simple illneses is as high as treating cancer in some other countries. Laloo Prasad, in fact, says that he can even clear the yo-yo test to make the court believe that he is completely fit and doesn’t require hospitalization.",POLITICS
Convert Teen Murti Bhavan to a designated protest place: Anna Hazare,"New Delhi: As Government mulls a plan to convert Teen Murti Complex to a museum for all previous PMs, veteran protester Anna Hazare has given his suggestion for the iconic complex in the heart of Delhi. Experienced faster Hazare has asked the government to declare it as the designated place for all fasts unto death to be held in the capital from now on.
Earlier, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had written a letter opposing any changes to the present complex as it will detract from Pandit Nehru’s legacy. Congress has been opposing any plans to change Teen Murti Bhavan but sources say they may agree to Anna Hazare’s proposal.
Speaking to the media at the site of a protest, Anna Hazare said,  “What Delhi needs is a good place for protests. Jantar Mantar is always so crowded thanks to thousands of useless protests that I never get a good place to sit there. Ramlila maidaan reminds me of Arvind Kejriwal and how he ditched me to start a political party so I don’t want to go there. Teen Murti Bhavan will be perfect as the location is good and there is sufficient area to accommodate dozens of my followers who would join me.”
“Right now, I can only protest during winters but at Teen Murti, I can protest indoors as well so summer protests will not be a problem as well. Then I can organize a fast unto death every month of the year. There are so many issues for which I have to protest so that will help me achieve my annual target of protests easily,” Mr. Hazare added.
Further, Mr. Hazare said, “If government doesn’t agree to my demand, I will start a fast unto death till they agree.”",POLITICS
Amrinder Singh shares copy of Rahul Gandhi’s embarrassing mark sheet to prove he was in school during 84 riots,"Defending his earlier statement that Rahul Gandhi not responsible for 84 riots as he was in school at that time, Captain Amrinder Singh today shared Rahul’s school marksheet to prove his point.
The move however turned out to be an embarrassment for the Congress President, as the marksheet revealed some not so good facts about his academics. (At the request of Congress party Faking News will not be reproducing the content of the marksheet.)
While speaking to the media Amrinder Singh said, “I saw that many of you were still not convinced with my argument. So I am sharing Rahulji’s marksheet. Feast your eyes on it and see for yourself. He was in school at that time so how can you blame him. So what if the marks are not good. At least he has the courage to share it, unlike those in power who have things to hide and submit fake degrees.”
“Rahul is the low hanging fruit for the media. For BJP he is punching bag. But I feel he has been misunderstood all along. It is preposterous to blame him for something which took place when he was 13 years old. I agreee some of his statements give an impression that he is still 13, but that does not mean you can attribute the riots to him,” Mr. Singh said.
Congress Party has however dismissed Amrinder’s statement and said that the party President’s marksheet is not for public consumption. “That is not Rahulji’s marksheet. How can he score 20 out of 100 in English. I personally did all his homework and helped him study during exams,” said a surprised Shashi Tharoor.",POLITICS
Rahul Gandhi to train under Mulayam Singh Yadav to deliver a speech which no one can understand,"Germany: Rahul Gandhi’s pit stops in the European powerhouse made plenty of news — for example, he brought up the example of the Islamic State’s formation while accusing the Modi government of excluding minorities from development.
He was seen at a food stall later. Not before giving the trollers some meaty material by the way of a collage taken at the German parliament. But the roof came crashing down when on asked about Doklam, he said that he doesn’t have the details of the issue. This is the same Rahul Gandhi who for last one year has been accusing the govt of playing it softly at Doklam.
The Congress party is really worried that if he keeps giving such speeches,  they may face the same consequences as in 2014. The best way to save embarrassment is obviously by not speaking, but even if Rahul utters some words, it would be better for Congress if people don’t understand those words. And taking a step in this direction, Rahul Gandhi will undergo training under Mulayam Singh Yadav for 1 month to utter words which cannot be understood by people.
Mulayam has given many controversial statements, but none of those statements were ever understood by the media. It was only after the media hired experts to decode his speeches that they were able to understand what Netaji meant to say. Rahul wants the same confidence which makes Mulayam speak on any issue without fearing anyone. And why should he fear when none of the words uttered by him are decoded by the press.",POLITICS
"Terrace pipe leaks at politician's house, politician does an aerial survey of the incident","Lucknow: At a time when torrential rains are causing havoc in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday conducted an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas in Lakhimpur Kheri and Gonda districts. In fact Areal surveys are becoming a fashion statement nowadays. Shwetank Srivastava, a UP MLA actually did a survey of his own house where a terrace pipeline was leaking.
On Friday Morning, Shwetank was told by his servants that the terrace pipeline was leaking and the terrace was filled with water. It needed immediate attention from a plumber. But then reputation was also at stake. At a time when ministers and MPs are doing surveys of flood-hit areas, it doesn’t make sense for Shwetank to sit quietly. And so he took a major decision. Shwetank called a private chopper and went on the aerial survey of his house. The chopper flew for around 50 minutes over the top of Shwetank’s house. The result derived after the survey was that a plumber is required to fix the pipeline and Shwetank asked his secretary to give him a full report of the survey findings.
In fact, a press conference was called at his house where Shwetank briefed the media about the Aerial survey and the need to go for it. According to him, an aerial survey gives a full account of the incident and also the fix required for it. As from the ground, it is not possible to see everything that is impacting the terrace. After looking at the incident, more MLAs have gone ahead with the decision to do more aerial surveys in future. The chopper industry is the one to benefit from such decisions.",POLITICS
We will end ISIS by making Baghdadi a Constable in Delhi Police: Rahul Gandhi,"New Delhi: Much to the relief of the entire world, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has promised he will end dreaded terrorist organisation ISIS once Congress comes to power in India in 2019. During a function in Germany, Mr Gandhi said that they will recruit ISIS head Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi as a Constable in Delhi Police, providing him a stable job and thus ending ISIS.
Earlier during his Euro Trip, Mr Gandhi had highlighted how lack of jobs led to the creation of ISIS, an organization that went on to unleash widespread terror around the world, and in Iraq and Syria in particular.
Speaking to a group of students, Mr Gandhi said, “We thought about various jobs for Baghdadi and concluded that a Police Constable will be the best post for him, a boring desk job may not be suitable for an all action Baghdadi. As a Police Constable in India, he can freely indulge in violence without any repercussions, of course he will have to stop killing people but that tendency will anyway get removed from his system once he gets a stable government job.”
“Our opponents in India can’t even provide jobs to Indian youth so there is no way they will be able to accommodate Baghdadi and his men in government jobs. They hate migrant workers as well so that is another problem in the current scenario. However, once we gain power in 2019, our first move will be to end global terrorism by advertising posts in Delhi Police for these people,” the Congress President added.
Congress is now expecting support from the entire world during next year’s general elections in India as they have promised to deliver a world free of terrorism.
Meanwhile, a confused and dazed Baghdadi was spotted in Syria asking his followers if all they needed was a 9 To 5 job.",POLITICS
"With Prohibition already in place, Bihar govt decides to stop water supply on 2nd Oct to celebrate dry day","Patna: The jury is out on whether the prohibition in Bihar has worked or not. The Nitish Kumar government feels that prohibition has led to more women participating in the election process, fewer incidents of domestic violence and crime against women. Though the latest shelter home rape cases have exposed the govt findings. One problem the prohibition law has caused is that of celebrating Dry Day on important occasions like Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October. But Nitish Kumar seems to have found a solution for that too. Yes, Bihar government has decided to stop water supply throughout Bihar to celebrate the dry day.
The prohibition law, which Nitish’s government brought within six months of coming to power in 2015 was only one, though perhaps the most potent, of the elements of his strategy to create and nurture a political constituency among women. And now with an innovative way of celebrating Dry Day, Nitish is really making everyone happy. There are strict orders to all municipal corporations to stop water supply from 0000 Hrs on 2nd October. Any corporation found supplying water will be strictly dealt with and the same punishment will be given which is given to the bootleggers in the current scenario.
Citizens have been told to store extra water on 1st October so that they don’t face issues on 2nd October. Any person found drinking water in public will also be given warning. This seems to be a great decision for the chai lovers in Bihar as on 2nd October they will get pure-milk tea, which is a rarity nowadays. Gravies in restaurants will be without water and use of tissue paper in restrooms will be encouraged on 2nd October.",POLITICS
Arvind Kejriwal on an overnight protest in front of Ashutosh's house following latter's resignation from the party,"CM Arvind Kejriwal, deputy Manish Sisodia, and Satyendra Jain are at it again! A rather silent hunger strike is being held by the trio, but this time not against the Center or LG but against the decision of their own party member, Ashutosh.
Ashutosh had resigned from the party yesterday, and if sources are to be believed, the reason for doing so is best known to him only.
Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia have spent the last night sleeping outside Ashutosh’s house, demanding cancellation of his resignation. Ashutosh plays an important role in the party and his absence will decrease the credibility of the party and will impact the party’s irrelevance in the current political scenario, where it is renowned for all things weird. Ashutosh is not only quitting AAP, but he has abandoned politics altogether.
Faking News reporter spoke to Yogendra Yadav, a former party member, and political analyst regarding Ashutosh’s abrupt resignation. Yogendra Yadav pointed out that Ashutosh was always meant to play a bigger role and if he has taken this decision consciously, unlike the way he tweets, then we must appreciate it. He further added that Ashutosh must return to journalism, which now has a dearth of good journalists who are ready to get humiliated and sometimes even slapped for reporting the truth.
It’s Arvind Kejriwal’s birthday today and party workers are confused where to reach to wish him. As news broke about the hunger strike, many AAP workers were seen carrying cakes and chocolates, marching towards Ashutosh’s house. But whether Arvind Kejriwal will cut the cake while being on hunger protest is yet to be seen. For more news stay tuned to Faking News.",POLITICS
BHEL to start manufacturing phones after heavy public demand,"Rahul Gandhi and gaffes are so interconnected that many people believe that Rahul Gandhi’s full name is Rahul Gandhi gaffe. Normally, it’s the BJP that gets benefitted from his bloopers, but this time, the heavy engineering centered PSU, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), is also going to reap the benefits.
Recently, while addressing a rally in Chhattisgarh, Rahul Gandhi accused Chhattisgarh CM Dr. Raman Singh of a scam and asked him why he didn’t buy phones from BHEL. CM Raman Singh has launched ‘Sanchar Kranti Yojna’ under which 50 lakh people will be given free smartphones. Trying to bring the people of Chhattisgarh into confidence, Rahul Gandhi got overboard and asked CM Raman Singh why he didn’t source these phones from BHEL.
Soon after the video got leaked on Social Media, users started asking for places from where they can buy BHEL made phones. What initially looked like sarcasm turned out to be a big opportunity for BHEL and the very next day BHEL announced its new unit in Bhopal that will start manufacturing phones before the end of the year.
Faking News reporter spoke to BHEL MD, Mr. K P Sharma. Mr. Sharma said, “See this is an opportune moment for us because when phone companies like Apple and Samsung are witnessing tough competition, people want to buy phone from a company that doesn’t even manufacture phones. So, obviously we are going to fulfill public demand and we have already started the procedure of installing a unit in Bhopal”.
This is not the first time when someone’s gaffe has become a boon to a company. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, while addressing people on his live Facebook, had talked about Bullet train ticket pricing and had estimated it to be as high as Rs. 75000. This estimate gave the govt, and also the Japanese company manufacturing bullet train engines, an upper hand in overpricing the tickets as people anyway would expect ticket prices to be exorbitantly high.",POLITICS
Police arrests person who was laying ‘Black’ colored tar road on Amit Shah’s rally route assuming him to be a protestor,"Kolkata: Three people, including two women, were arrested for allegedly waving black flags and jumping in front of BJP chief Amit Shah’s convoy in the Dhoomanganj area two weeks back. The protesters claimed to be members of the Samajwadi Party’s student wing, Dhoomanganj SHO Sandeep Mishra said, adding that they were arrested on the charge of breach of peace. A purported video of the incident showing police personnel manhandling the protesters went viral on social media.
Instead of learning something from the incident, police has, in fact, become more vigilant in dealing with the protestors. Today when Amit Shah was traveling from the airport to the central part of the city, there was a contractor who was laying black colored tar road. Though the color of tar roads across India is black, but this being on the rally route of Amit Shah, police took it as a protest and arrested the contractor. Contractor Shwetank Srivastava who was arrested from the spot has conveyed that all tar roads made by him are black in color and he was not protesting Amit Shah’s rally.
The incident can be detrimental in the already crippling infrastructure projects of India as contractors will think twice before taking the responsibility of making a tar road from now onwards. As the rally progressed, police arrested people wearing black colored clothes, riding black motorbikes, cars, and also people who were seen watching the movie ‘Black’ along the way of the rally route. There have been 30-35 arrests as per our report. Amit Shah meanwhile has come out and said that none of the arrests were made at his orders and that he believes in complete democracy.",POLITICS
Parliament Street closed for the day as MPs shoot their Kiki Challenge videos,"New Delhi: Parliament Street (Sansad Marg) in Delhi will remain closed for the next 24 hrs as all the Indian MPs are getting in on the latest viral phenomenon, the Kiki challenge. To make sure there are no traffic problems due to the challenge, Delhi Traffic Police has decided to close the road for all other vehicles for the day.
The “Kiki challenge” involves jumping out of a moving car and dancing alongside it to Drake’s hit In My Feelings, while the car continues moving. It has become an online rage with people from all over the world posting their videos executing the challenge.
Speaking to Faking News, an MP from Central India said, “This is just a way for us to connect to young voters. They will feel we are the true representatives of them if they see us doing stupid things for Likes and Retweets online. One MP came up with the idea while having the subsidized lunch in Parliament canteen and soon everyone showed interest in doing the challenge. There is nothing to do inside the parliament, at least we can achieve something during this Monsoon session.”
“All the MPs doing the challenge on the road could have created problems for the other commuters so we requested Delhi Police to make some arrangements. They have decided to close the road completely to make sure common people aren’t affected while we do our challenge,” the MP added.
A Delhi Police official while confirming the news said, “Actually, we just didn’t want the people to see their elected representatives acting like fools and then falling down on the side of the road in the process. They may have started wondering about the point of democracy itself.”
Meanwhile, BMC has warned Mumbaikars against trying any Kiki challenge stunt in Mumbai and has said that BMC will not be responsible if any resident falls into a pothole while doing this challenge.",POLITICS
'O Neta Kal Aana' Cryptic Message on Ganpati Posters scares the $#!^ out of Netas,"Mumbai, one random day: India, they say treats its guests with ‘Atithi Devo Bhav’. & where else does this adage hold truer than when Bappa arrives to the tunes of Bollywood item songs in Mumbai during Ganpati. There are brands glaring at you as you stand in the queue for your selfie with the tusked god and then there are NETAS! Yes, the Netas from BJP, Congress, MNS, SS, NCP, TDP, BSP, CPI, CPI (M), CPI (Ass) and what not. There are more parties in India than there are gods.
So coming to the point, the Netas look at with you with those droopy over Black Dog eyes and gleaming as pearl teeth. This incident highlights the plight of one of these spiteful brother-in-law to an ex-MLA’s PA who woke up to find that his brother-law’s boss’ poster was marked with a message ‘O NETA KAL AANA’. The font was Comic Sans. The brother-in-law of the ex-MLA’s PA panicked, the ex-MLA’s PA sighed, the ex-MLA fainted! & the chain grew. Within 2 nights, of 1764 Netas had their posters smashed by the same cryptic message – that is a total of 2,53,900 posters in total (97.8% of total Ganpati posters in the city). This was cutting across party lines and everyone from corporators, to PM, to dynasts and relatives were none spared. Some of those whose poster got smeared were followed by the PM on Twitter.
No arrests have been made so far, though some marketeers claim, Netflix is doing this to market the Season 2 of Bhavesh Joshi Superhero (speculation). Whatever be the cause, this has sent the entire political establishment in the city in a flurry & huddle. Never ever, ever never, has anyone dared to torment our politicos in a similar fashion since the time Arnab did RaGa.
Most though are happy. ‘O Neta Kal Aana’ has a verified Facebook & Instagram account and 1000’s fakes. A not Mr. Bagga has also introduced a line of T-shirts with faces of your most despicable Netas available for the message. According to fans, it was high time someone decided to troll the poster boys of public nuisance on their own posters.",POLITICS
Abhinandan Sekhri to be canonised by Vatican,"Post his confirmation that Jesus Christ and Prophet Muhammad were indeed historical figures, Vatican released a press statement acknowledging Abhinandan Sekhri’s contribution to further the evangelical mission.
It is already in the public domain that Abhinandan had doubted Krishna’s existence but acknowledged both Christ and Muhammad were historical figures. The office of Pope is even considering to canonise Abhinandan Sekhri. If and when it happens, Sekhri would become the first Saint to be declared so while living on earth.
The saint of India
One official who was very, very close to the Pope, but preferred to be anonymous said this decision was a conscious one, subject to one condition. Though the informer refused to spell out the exact condition for Sekhri to become a living Saint, he referred to the issue of Christ’s birth and death. Apparently Vatican considers Sekhri as the reincarnation of one of the three wise men who travelled to Jerusalem to greet the infant Christ.
When asked what is new in Sekhri’s statement that Christ was a historical figure, the pontiff laughed. It is true that Christ was a historical figure. However, there always was a certain myth around his birth and death. We hope, Abhinandan Sekhri to use his good analytical skills and remove this myth.
However, the former Vatican man, who wanted Pope to resign from his post sent a mail to us saying that this decision is only to divert attention of the world media from the continuously popping up of various sex scandals involving many Bishops and all kinds of human beings from kids to old men and women. Apart from the diversion, canonising someone from India or China would also help the Church in its evangelical mission of harvesting souls. After Goa inquisition, the conversion rate of Indians has fallen to a very slow rate. Despite lures ranging from rice bags to study sponsorship in the Western countries, the rate of conversion remained low. Not even canonising Teresa could accelerate the growth rate of conversion. So, the Church is toying with the idea of having a “living saint”.
Efforts to reach Sekhri for his response have failed. Newslaundry office however, has replied that Sekhri is on a very important tsk of ‘converting’ mythology into history and cannot be disturbed.",POLITICS
AAP evolves caste politics,"Like the Congress party and the BJP, the new political party AAP has also not been wholly detached from advancing the caste factor in the electoral politics. It cannot be told that the AAP is under stress because it keeps touching the traditional caste factor in its party politics.
Former AAP leader Ashutosh has accused the party of having tried to invoke caste sentiments by using his surname during the 2014 elections. Afterwards, another prominent leader Atishi Marlena has dropped her exceptional surname because it sounded more like a Christian name.
‘Marlena’ is the last name of Atishi, which is said to be a title mingling Marx and Lenin. It has been emphasised that she has dropped her given name for some kind of the higher objective. Coming of a Punjabi Rajput family she became the party’s first candidate for the 2019 parliamentary polls.
Although her actual surname ends with ‘Singh’ yet she refrains using the last name simply to put a damper on the caste-based politics. Was her Christian sounding surname ‘Marlena’ averse to the caste-based political setting?
She has made it clear that it was not been initiated under the party’s pressure. It was her own decision as she wanted to show her caste-free face.
Denying the influence of caste angle on his party, the AAP general secretary Akshay Marathe stated that our discourse was around healthcare and education not on identities of caste and religion.
Taking the point even the AIMIM chief Assad-ud-din Owaisi said this was the reality of Indian politics. One could not have a Muslim or Christian sounding name to get elected. Naturally, he took the time to study the caste factor in the politics and its effects over the clever political designs; his mind definitely hangs around the politics which is fixed firmly on the caste connection.",POLITICS
"Rahul Gandhi nominated for Nobel – in Economics and of course, Peace","Welcoming the latest insipid err… inspiring speech by Rahul Gandhi in the land of Hitler about the ill effects of unemployment, Martya Sen, the other Nobel winner in Economics wanted a Nobel in Economics to Rahul Gandhi too.
“It is refreshingly new idea!” Mr. Sen exclaimed flailing his hands in air in excitement. “Linking lack of employment to becoming terrorists is perhaps the most important observation made by any philosopher, thinker and a politician in the last century. In other words, Rahul ji has identified the root cause of the most devastating problem of the world – Terrorism. And, as Rahul ji explained, the cause was too simple despite the problem is so complex” he said with a smile on his face.
“After the famous Panch Sheel theory proposed by Pandit ji, no Indian could come up with such a lucid theory to address problems of the working world. Though Indira Gandhi’s ‘Garibi Hatao’ was a good slogan, it lacked the depth of understanding so could not qualify to become a philosophy in itself” he added. When one of the reporter wanted to explain this lengthy statement on Indira Gandhi, Martya laughed and advised him to listen to the caption in loop for 100 times. “It is a cryptic statement and only the intelligent like Rahul ji can comprehend it in the first instance”, he explained his advice but not his statement.
“Consider a world where everybody is having a job to do. If everyone is busy in their jobs, from where one can recruit terrorists. It would difficult to recruit even the ordinary stone-pelters. The solution Rahul ji proposed would solve both unemployment and terrorism, biggest two problems of the world. So, he deserves two Nobels, one for Economics and one for establishing World Peace” he concluded.
Seconding the nomination by Martya Sen was Bakra Baghdadi, inspirational leader of ISIS. He concurred with Rahul’s explanation of “unemployment created ISIS”. “Back in those days, all jobs in Arab countries were done by American expats and Indian workers leaving the native population with nothing to do but fighting. That was what we used to do. Even before ISIS came into existence, there were Saddam, Qaddafi who were providing employment to native Arabs by recruiting them into armies. Suddenly Amreecans came and the job market vanished in the desert storm. So, Osama had to take it upon himself to provide employment to our people. Later on, we took it over from him and expanded the job market” Baghdadi explained. Beaming with pride he continued “Now, our workers are so skilled they migrated to entire Europe and are one of the major workforce in Germany and France”.
When contacted over email, Germany chancellor Merkel had agreed with Bakra Baghdadi and accepted that the migrants from Middle East are fusing the Europe in the most sharp and pointed way, where otherwise the life was very dull.
Summarising all the views from all the places, Barkha Dutt too added her own experiences with misguided children of Kashmir, particularly the sons of school masters were turning into terrorists. The way Rahul Gandhi could express his opinion so effervescently, I could sense his confidence had increased more than that of Narendra Modi. If he gets these two Nobels before elections, chances of Mahagathbandhan forming a government in 2019 increase manifold, she opined.",POLITICS
Rahul Gandhi accuses BJP of practicing Black Magic,"Agitated at being humiliated by the BJP’s top brass time and again, Rahul Gandhi, Entertaining President of Congress accused BJP in strongest of the language and his main target was Amit Shah.
Recently, during his speech, the microphone malfunctioned. As he was deeply into the speech, Rahul had to shout so his voice could be heard to the backbenchers and it strained his already strained voice. In a fit of fury, he declared that the microphone was switched off by Amit Shah. “Amit Shah can’t digest I convey my thoughts to you so you all be happy. He was a sadist who wanted to project me as a Pappu” Rahul Gandhi vented out his frustration.
“They asked me to close my eyes like this”, said Rahul Gandhi
After sipping a peg of Corex, he continued in the voice that sounded almost like an iron sheet being scratched by nails. “You all know I went to the famous Doon school. You all know I went to the Cambridge University. You all know I have travelled length and breadth of the world – from Thailand to Bahamas. And, you all know how many blunders I make in public life”.
Pushing up his long sleeves to expose his hairy arms, he forced red streaks into his otherwise dazed eyes and took a deep breath. “Yes. I committed many blunders. I talk nonsense most of the time. How can a Cambridge educated guy commit such gaffes? Is it possible? Despite being chaiwala, even Narendra Modi doesn’t commit these many silly mistakes.   So, why was I making so many mistakes” he questioned the audience.
Meanwhile the electrician wearing Orange scarf walked to him and took the mic and switched it on muttering “Maybe you are always on high”. The mic started functioning. Rahul Gandhi sighed loudly and the noise wrapped entire meeting hall that everyone present there felt Rahul Gandhi next to him.
Rahul continued “See, even now I switched the mic off and was blaming Amit Shah. Even the electrician thinks I am always on high. How can I do such gaffes on a regular basis? How come it became natural for me to commit mistakes and talk nonsense? Here am I, the son of former Prime Minister, who was the son of a former Prime Minister, who was the daughter of a former Prime Minister. How can the theory of genetics be wrong?”
“Last month, worried about my continuous degradation in the public life, Momma contacted a sorceress from Milan, a beautiful city in Italy. This particular sorceress was considered to be living from the times of Galileo and you know what she said? The opposition party used Black Magic to target me. And, it started even before I entered into politics.”
“Even as BJP formed their first ever government, they schemed to rule India forever. So, they have to stop me because I am the only one who can stop BJP. Worried at my intelligence, oratory and management skills, they feared that they may not rule forever as their ideologues planned. They wanted the country to be corruption free and develop like China. But, we are not inhuman like the Chinese, who execute their corrupt officials. How can we have development that comes at the cost of lives of corrupt officers and politicians? It cannot so happen. I will never allow it to happen.”
“It was then, someone from BJP started using Black Magic to target my mental prowess. Slowly my intelligence started reducing. I became more agitated. I started speaking without thinking of consequences, as I am talking now. Momma asked the sorceress to be our guest and do counter the Black Magic so I can become normal guy again.”
All the audience were listening attentively as if they were watching Ramsay film. They could visualise a girl going under shower only be bathed in red colour water.
Sensing their attention, Rahul declared “Alas, the sorceress could not come to India. She was denied visa by the BJP government. Now, tell me what harm a four hundred year old lady could do to our country. She was coming only to help me, to rehabilitate me. But, the BJP leadership is not taking any chances and are preventing her visit to India. So, I am visiting her to get rid of the ill effects of Black Magic. Whenever I feel not comfortable, I go to the place where she was visiting another client. So I travelled to Thailand, Mauritius and Hawaii. Even these visits were ridiculed by BJP as they called them pleasure visits. How can I, the eternal bachelor be engaged any pleasure seeking activities?”
“Finally I spoke my mind and took a heavy burden off. Now, as I spoke the truth, let BJP deny they have not engaged in witchcraft against me. They will never tell. They can’t see in my eye. They can’t smell my breath. They can’t stand my touch. They shiver when I hug them. And they fear even my winks”.
He suddenly shuddered and opened eyes. Sonia Gandhi was shaking him and said “Stop giving speeches in dreams. Get up and get ready. You need to visit two temples and one mosque today”.",POLITICS
Trying to snake-charm buffalo,"Bhains Ke Aage Been Bajana proved correct in Dewas when the domestic animal turned violent. Perhaps, this Biblical phrase was a kind of instruction to the people by Jesus Christ. Its meaning was usually taken as a useless effort or negligence that was what the Congress party functionaries along with the anguished commuters wanted to portray at their protest site.
But their discomfiture in not knowing how to properly deal with a buffalo has come as a very poignant scene before them as they could not realise of the animal’s aggressive behaviour all of a sudden. Were they so naive in playing the flute facing the animal with complete concentration?
When the Congress functionaries started trying to snake-charm a buffalo, enraged buffalo hit them hard amid the cacophony. The protestors ran helter-skelter as the buffalo’s fury was similar to Spanish bull in the race. Their planning was just spoiled by the brutal behaviour of the buffalo. They failed to read exactly what the cattle had in its huge mind. The agitators started running for a safe shelter. Some might think in their precocious mind that the buffalo was a staunch follower of the BJP because of its excessive concern about its peer cow. The Congressmen thought their action was for drawing Madhya Pradesh government’s attention towards delay in early approval of an inter-city bus service between Indore and Dewas in MP.
However, their garlanding and playing the flute did not secure ample approval by the particular cattle.
The moment it knocked down the politicians by its pointed horns there was utter chaos and commotion at the protest site. The injuries were treated with the first-aid facility immediately. They soulfully thanked the Almighty that none among them was seriously hurt. What began with a political motive ended in a very sad note.",POLITICS

Didi’s confusion between ‘Bisibela Bath’ and ‘Blood Bath’,"Setting:
After working hard on pouring down various colours on her old white saree, Didi stood quiet and looked at the violent mix of all ghastly colours. The white piece of cloth looked as if was used to clean a butcher’s shop after used to clean tables in a Mishti house. “How peaceful” she wondered and congratulated herself for painting such a thing that was beyond imagination for any other, ordinary mortal. She walked to the cot that was made of bamboos and jute (to match her simple lifestyle) and rested. She switched on the old Onida Black & White television and Panasonic VCR to watch her favourite recording. A group of her followers clad in simple dhotis were counting the cash that was looted from the Sadhana scam. A blissful smile crossed her lips. The video was a stress buster for her. Within minutes of watching, she relaxes and sleeps sound.
Twist:
After three minutes, however the video got blurred and the B&W TV screen was full of colours. Didi thought there was something wrong with the TV and wanted to tap it on the top so it can become normal. “Don’t get up!” the voice from the TV sprang as the vertical bars of colours transformed into colourful concentric circles zooming in and out simultaneously. “This is even freshening” she said to herself. And, she remembered nothing.
The Interview:
Seeing her immobile condition, Byomkesh Bakshi pulled the curtains and revealed himself. He came straight to her and dangled a gold locket tied to a silver thread in front of her. At the centre of the bangle are two emeralds shaped in the form of leaves, fixed over a crescent. Didi was in a trance but liked it more and decided (in her subconscious) to make it TMC symbol. Her eyes were rolling along with the locket that was swinging like a pendulum. Byomkesh suddenly remembered the Minny Mouse that swung eyes like that at Micky. So, Didi liked the design of locket. He decided to leave the locket for her, after his mission.
In the voice of Amrish Puri (when he was in romantic mood), Byomkesh asked “Didi, Do you want this locket”?
Didi: Yes.
BB: What you will do with it?
Didi: I will make this TMC symbol.
BB: This can be yours, if you clarify few doubts.
Didi: Ask me. Let me warn you. After I answer your questions, if you don’t give me the locket, I will bath in your blood.
Byomkesh genuinely feared. Pulling himself together, he asked the first question.
BB: Why you were threatening the Union government about impending Civil War and Blood Bath.
Didi: Civil War or not. I like to have Blood Bath.
BB: Didi, you were very peaceful lady. How can you think of bathing in blood?
Didi: Who said about bathing in blood? I want to eat ‘Blood Bath’. It is very tasty.
Byomkesh Bakshi was shocked. Eating ‘Blood Bath’? She must have gone nuts, he thought and decided against to continue the interview. ‘You may have the locket’ he handed over the locket to her.
Revealing:
Suddenly there was a sound of slippers flipping on the granite. Someone was coming. Byomkesh hid himself behind the curtain. An old lady came with a tray and set up supper for Didi. Seeing the food in front of her, there was a sparkle in the eyes of Didi. “Yyaah, Blood Bath” she cried loudly and put the locket aside and started eating. The old lady looked at Didi with pity and left. Byomkesh slowly left the room and followed the old lady. She heard his footsteps and turned to face him.
He introduced himself as a secret doctor and asked her what she had given to Didi to eat. She gave him a weird look and said “It was Bisibela Bath”, part of Kannada cuisine. He blurted “But, she was calling it Blood Bath. Why?”
The old lady heaved a sigh and said. “This was happening ever since she returned from Bengaluru after attending swearing ceremony of Kumaraswamy. During the dinner, Bisibela Bath was served and Didi liked it very much. Before she wanted to ask its name, Pappu asked Kumaraswamy what that item was. Already angry with the way he was forced to drink poison, Kumaraswamy said “Blood Bath, a speciality of Karnataka”. And, Didi took it seriously. She liked the taste of Bisibela Bath so much, she was eating it for breakfast, lunch and supper ever since. She had not even touched fish for the last two or three months. She became pure vegetarian. And I too am now forced to eat Bisibela Bath thrice a day”. She looked sad.
“So, you mean, Didi referred to Bisibela bath, when she threatened Central Government about Blood bath?” he probed further.
“The point is her English is a bit poor”, the old lady continued. “In fact she was supporting NRC. All she meant was once uncivilised people fighting on the streets would go away, the fights on the streets would be between only civilised ones – meaning only ‘debates and arguments’ and no physical fights. And, everyone would eat the vegetarian Bisibela Bath and live happily forever”.
A sarcastic smile passed over the lips of the old lady. “Coupled with her poor English were her ferocious facial expressions. And, she communicated something that is entirely opposite of what she wanted to say”.

Mamta insists on united fight,"What has been insisted by TMC leader Mamta Bannerji was moving with united stand in view of the BJP’s prevailing political position? This decisive strength can help win the ensuing parliamentary elections. Her January 19, 2019 rally was supposedly planned for the similar political cause.
She has firmly decided to stand on the standard of united we stand for defeating the BJP. Following her meeting with political big-wigs including Sonia Gandhi made her say: “Fight together, leader (Prime Minister) will be chosen later.”
Despite all the hostile criticisms by the Bhartiya Janata Party politicians, she was not frozen with her feet rooted where she firmly stood. She was utterly frank in girding up her loins for giving a befitting reply to the party in power in the approaching elections.
She wanted an invigorated political fight against the RSS-backed political party. However, she at the same time should also consider the disadvantages of the leaderless electoral battle. Will the consequences emerge the same as she visualises?
She pointed at defeating the BJP in different states where opposition stood in a strong position. Their collective fight would contain the BJP’s victory march keeping in mind its only aim of defeating the BJP at all costs.
All we can do was to stand firm on our combined purpose or else be entirely unable to overcome the saffron wave, she pointed out. If the BJP was criticising the TMC, BSP, SP, NCP, AAP and others for their collective approach, it was only to down their morale.
The BJP was taking every helpful constructive step to repeat the 2014 magic on the ground level. If its every step is vast and yet part of a larger design, there looks no obvious point in getting disheartened. The fight between the opposition allies’ persistence and the BJP’s resistance is power-enthused.",POLITICS
Why not register of politicians?,"When there continues so much hue and cry over the national register of citizenship, there should also be prepared a register of our politicians containing classified details. Instead, this should be an encyclopaedia. It can be decided by the politicians. The generations come to know of their deeds and contributions through that big book. When will this idea get momentum?
India entered into the extradition treaty with Bangladesh to bring back the ULFA separatists. The fate of forty lakh excluded from National Register of the Citizenship hangs in balance. How can they be pushed out to Bangladesh in case their citizenship proved? As regards Dharamshala, our country accepted Aryans, Huns, Portuguese, Arabs, Afghans, Jews, Dutch and English people who settled here. The recent Hungama is merely politics to contest elections in days to come. The ruling party knows very well that this issue of immigrants can bring sufficient benefit in the form of votes. The Congress party disagrees with the BJP on the issue while the Communists are sympathetic with them.
It is not only in our country but even the European countries have furthered the spurt of the Muslim population. Such kind of voice subsides with the passing of the time. The issue is not the exercise under the supervision of the apex court. Those numbers of enormous people who were supposed to have come from Bangladesh told to prove their identity. The humanitarian ground loses its vehemence in view of political perplexity. The matter, as certain politicians rightly said, was directly linked up with the Muslim inhabitants in Assam.
The political benefit could be reaped out of this issue in the state of Assam. That is being done with forceful efforts as leaders of the ruling party spare no time in expressing some words on the intricate issue.",POLITICS
"'Cow smuggling will be legalised with full tax waiver, once Congress comes to power' - RaGa steals hearts","New Delhi: Congress President and future Prime Minister of India, Rahul Gandhi has won the hearts of the non-communal Indians in a single statement. This has been proclaimed as the biggest assault on the Sangh and BJP by his coterie.
Speaking at a press meet, the winking superhero with the twinkle in his kingly eyes, Rahul Gandhi, spoke at length about politics. ‘Modi might not know the power of our people. Our people had always loved and cherished the term Pappu. Every other boy is a Pappu, but can you show me a boy named Modi? This should be realised by Modi and RSS. They are not targeting a single Pappu, that is me. They are targeting the entire Pappustan.’
‘Another burning issue that worries me for the past four years is the behaviour of gaurakshak. These mobs lynch people. People who had been labelled as cow smugglers and cow thieves.’, the Prince with Golden heart paused to look at us reporters. Two female reporters fainted with an eternal aww in their mouth and they were sent to their NDTV office once their visa was verified.
‘Let me say this clearly. Cow smuggling will be made a legal job once Congress comes to power. We will not call it cow smuggling, we will call it discreet transfer of cow ownership. Sorry, it will be called Rajiv Gandhi Gau Ownership Yojana. Under this, all the new secular cow owners need not pay tax for revenue generated by transporting them across borders. No GST too.’ There was huge round of applause and Congress workers outside the press club started burning crackers and feeding cakes to posters of Rahul.
News channels were splashed with this historic announcement and cow smugglers future secular cow owners rejoiced at this announcement. Communal Cow owners were shocked, but could not express it outside due to fear of being labelled a Hindu.
Not all cow smugglers future cow owners were happy. ‘We were earlier scared of being lynched by the communal cow owners and protectors. That fear still resides in us. We will request our next PM to provide us legal protection when we carry on with our job, which could involve terminating the cow owners along with the ownership.’
A senior lawyer-cum-activist cleared their fears saying that ‘the secular future cow owners have those rights even now and they have the backing of liberals and seculars with them if they terminate the communal cow owners if they do not comply during the transfer of ownership’.",POLITICS
Trinomoola Congress MP Derek No'Brain crowned as 'best Social Media influencer' by Forbes,"New Delhi: Everybody knows Trinomoola Congress MP Derek No’Brain. To identify him as is a no-brainer. He is the news now after appearing in Forbes’ best Social Media influencer.
While the Nazi Trinomoola party is busy butchering its opposition party cadres, like (what about Akhlaq, what about Wani) BJP, Mr. No’Brain is busy influencing their Twitter accounts online. And this has changed his path from quizmaster to a social media broker influencer.
In the Forbes’ list, Derek was at the top of the people who easily made it to influencer club. It all started when No’Brain mentioned a private citizen Rahul Taj in the Parliament. Since then, the name Rahul was recorded in the logs of the Parliament. ‘A momentary break from hysterical laughter for its readers who read through the debates of other Rahul’s in the Parliament’, an analyst commented.
Recently, No’Brain has also dragged another private citizen Prash Patel. ‘After No’Brain spelt my name in the Parliament, my Twitter account got 1 lakh followers’, claimed Mr. Patel. ‘Dude, I got some 4 lakh added. Without spending a single paisa‘, brimmed Rahul (the private citizen).
After the Patel’s incident, several other Twitter users were seen begging, pleading, trolling, spamming and even abusing No’Brain in Twitter so that their account too gets a lot of followers.
Social Media’s (ex-)biggest influencer company, WeFollow’s CEO, Anand Varma, was continuously mentioning No’Brain from the Twitter accounts bought by his clients to his company. ‘Somehow, we should get his attention. A single utterance of our client’s name in the Parliament will surpass our previous profits’, Anand sounded excited.
However, Twitter users from Bangla (aka West Bengal) were scared of mentioning No’Brain on Twitter. ‘We too will get followers when we try to mention him’, commented a student from Kolkotta, ‘we will get hundreds of followers, not in Twitter, but on our roads, following to finish me off.’",POLITICS

So my only prayer to the almighty is to give me just one buttock.”
Hiren’s request struck a chord with many other passengers who have been braving heavy rush in local trains for all these years. A city based cosmetic surgeon even offered to surgically remove one of Hiren’s buttock free of charge. “Why wait for the next birth. I will help this man in this life itself,” said the doctor.
After this news went viral on social media, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal assured that he’d set up a special committee to study and find out a solution to this problem. The committee will be headed by a retired IIT professor and a report is expected to to tabled in a year.
TV personality Ekta Kapoor, moved by Hiren’s plight, will produce a TV show titled Agle Janam Mohe Ek Buttock Hi Dijo, that will revolve around local train travelers. Tusshar Kapoor will play the protagonist in the series.",POLITICS

'Just trying to fit into Delhi culture by brandishing gun' says ex-BSP MP's son over accusation,"Putting across his side of the story, ex- BSP MPs son Ashish Pandey admitted that he did brandish a gun as seen in the video but it was done to fit into the typical Delhi culture.
While elaborating on the ‘typical Delhi culture’, he said, “It’s a Delhi thing you know. When ‘tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai’ doesn’t work then you whip out your gun. It’s done as a scare tactic and no to actually shoot someone.”
“I am from Lucknow and even fights over there done with tehzeeb. I would be treated like an outcast if I tried that in Delhi. So I had to carry a gun and a baseball bat in my car to just to show that I am part of Delhi’s high society,” he added.
South Delhi businessman SK Khurana, though hesitant initially, did agree that these things are common in Delhi and media shouldn’t overreact. “Why is that Arnab behaving like a rabid mongrel over this issue. If he hadn’t brandished the weapon then it would have been a national crisis,” he said.
“I remember once I had an argument with a man after he cut me in traffic. We were talking like gentlemen and sorting the issue when some bystanders got restless and asked when are we going to start fighting. They were not happy with our politeness and wanted to hear some cuss words,” he recollected.
A senior bureaucrat, while commenting in the incident said that people coming from outside should respect the culture of Delhi. “Please liberally flaunt your political connections. Invest in a gun if you can afford it, especially the high society types. Carry a baseball bat in you car to start a road rage without provocation. In fact car dealers should give baseball bats as standard accessory,” he suggested.",POLITICS

After a month of regularly hitting the gym, Ashish has become an expert in recommending Protein supplments to anyone who wishes to listen.
It all started with his trainer giving him a crash course on supplements that every gym newbie should be aware of.
Ashish still fondly remembers his first day at Diamond Muscle Gym. “I don’t think I touched any equipment on day 1. It was all about protein shakes, BCAA, Creatine, Glutamine etc. And things weren’t any different on the rest of the days,” he said while speaking to our reporter.

Marriage functions of Navi Mumbai couples held in Mumbai cannot be labelled as destination wedding: Supreme Court,"Mumbai: Mumbai is a city of dreams and people come here from far off places to make their dreams a reality. But then people also come from Navi Mumbai and Virar to work here. The craze for Mumbai among people in Navi Mumbai is so high that some couples hold their marriage functions in Mumbai and call it a destination wedding. This has been a trend in many of the last years.
Harneet Singh, a resident of Navi Mumbai, who recently got married to his longtime girlfriend did the same when he printed the invitation cards with ‘Destination Wedding’ written on them. This made their friends excited about the marriage. Some friends shopped for clothes, some learned to dance and many spent a lot of money to look cool at the destination wedding. But everyone left in shock when Harneet announced 2 days before his wedding that the destination of the wedding will be Mumbai. Dreams were shattered, sad faces were seen among Harneet’s friends.

Couple gets remarried after photographer loses memory card with wedding pictures,"Mumbai: The most simplistic explanation for marriage mania has to be media infiltration. Most girls can remember watching commercials featuring smiling brides and their smitten new grooms. From youth, we’ve read stories and watched movies about the quest to find that perfect person. And that makes a marriage so very important. But more than marriages itself, it is the photos and videos which share more importance in the current society. Social media platforms have made marriage a shareworthy event rather than just a private family function. In a weird incident in Mumbai, a couple had to remarry as the photographer lost the memory card which contained their wedding pictures.
Sanil Malik had planned his wedding long before and even before that he had planned the photo shoot of his wedding. The amount spent on the photographer was 50% of the total wedding budget. He and his wife had also thought about hashtags to be used while sharing the pics on Facebook. But the planning was left shattered when on the day of the wedding, the photographer lost the memory card after all functions were covered by him. Sanil and his wife were so unhappy that people thought they were emotional as they are getting married but deep within they were upset that they don’t have any pics to share now.
The photographer though gave them an idea to remarry and told that he would give them a discount of 50% on their re-marriage. Though it was an idea which was didn’t seem practical enough, Sanil and his social media savvy wife readily agreed and the marriage function was held yesterday.",SOCIETY
"New type of sea view flats launched in Mumbai, builder will provide cab to see marine drive and come back","Mumbai: The Economic Survey has raised concern about the vacant housing inventory, especially in metros such as Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru. The Survey points out that despite a housing shortage, there is an inventory overhang. Mumbai tops the list with 0.48 million vacant houses.
People are very cautious about buying the new property after the confusion raised by GST and other real estate parameters. But Shwetank Srivastava, an expert real estate player has launched a new scheme of flats in Mumbai where he will provide sea view flats to residents. But there is a twist here. The flats will not be sea view ones actually, but the builder will provide cab on a daily basis free of cost to travel to marine drive, watch the sea and come back.
Finding a sea view flat in space-crunched Mumbai is too difficult. So Shwetank had to come up with something innovative. And technically, the service provided by him would count under the sea view flat category.  Even the BMC is happy with the initiative taken by Shwetank as due to the service provided by him, more people will be willing to buy property at far off locations and visit Mumbai to have a look at the sea. This would lessen the burden on residential property in the heart of Mumbai. Also, it will provide economic opportunities to cab service providers.
The flats will obviously by premium priced and getting a sea view daily in Mumbai does come with a cost involved. More builders have started following Shwetank’s example but Shwetank will still get the first mover advantage and has started advance booking for the new range of housing property.",SOCIETY
"Candidate waits for 2 hrs for his scheduled interview, gets immediately hired to sit on the bench of IT company","Bengaluru: The joke about Indian software companies used to be that without a name board outside, you would be hard-pressed to distinguish one from the other inside. Their style of recruitment makes this case even stronger. Hiring a lot of people and using most of them to just show its bench strength. few lucky ones get projects after projects while the rest await their chance. But to get hired for the bench also requires a lot of skill, as shown by Shwetank Srivastava in Lucknow. Shwetank got hired by a software company just for the patience he showed while waiting for his interview.
Shwetank had been long waiting for his chance to get interviewed for India’s largest It company TTS. He has prepared well for his interview, had visited all forums giving tips to clear the interview process and also taking suggestions from his seniors. But none of his preparations came to use on the day of the interview.
Shwetank reached the TTS office at the scheduled time of the interview but had to wait for quite some time as the interviewer had not yet arrived. This made Shwetank a bit nervous but he stuck there as this was a lifetime opportunity. Minutes of waiting were soon getting converted to hours and by the time the interviewer arrived, Shwetank had spent almost 3 hrs waiting there.
Normally when an interview is postponed for so long, what happens is the interview gets rescheduled for some other time. But not at TTS, as patience is a key skill required to be a TTSer. And that is what the interviewer saw in Shwetank, loads and loads of patience. There are people who get impatient sitting on the bench and they do some weird stuff but the TTS HR team soon realized that Shwetank was just opposite of that. A person who can wait for 3 hrs to get hired for the bench, indeed deserves the bench much more than anyone else. And that made Shwetank’s dream of working with TTS come true, by just playing his natural game.",SOCIETY

Most of the questions would be very simple and on topics which kids are aware of for e.g. GST, UP elections, English Premier league and Bollywood collections to name a few. Kids nowadays have access to almost all news and the test will give an unbiased platform to all kids to show their knowledge.”
Coaching centers have come up across the city for helping parents prepare their kids for the entrance exam. In fact the no of coaching centers have surpassed the no of pre-schools in the city. Even the coaching center association is planning an entrance exam to admit kids into their facilities.
If that was not enough counselling centers have opened up for kids who will fail to clear the coaching center entrance exam. Kids are definitely lucky to have such caring surroundings.
Even the parents seem happy. Some of the responses collected by our reporter include “Kids have to be competitive right from the beginning”, “At our age we dint have such coaching facilities, our kids are privileged and they should understand it”, “I would even suggest that they have a quota system in the exam, so that kids are better prepared for the future.”

This is what happened through the day and evening. Mukesh, taking a break from Google search at office, booked a table for candlelight dinner at the 13th floor restaurant in MG road. It was for the date with his girlfriend Sandhya who has recently shifted to Bengaluru from Hyderabad.
“As soon as I entered the place felt it was over crowded for a week day, may be many had booked like me due to the discounts they offer on week days. The restaurant manager escorted me to a table where my unknown ‘girlfriend’ was waiting”, Mukesh told his roommate after reaching his room.

Couple files for divorce following an altercation on what is better: Misal Pav or Rajma Chawal,"Delhi: A disgruntled couple ended 7 years of their relationship and filed for divorce after they could not come down to a common consensus on what is better: Rajma Chawal or Misal Pav.
Ankita Arora and Rohan Deshmukh fell for each other while they were together in a college in Pune and got married just a year after they started dating. Their relationship was sailing smoothly until last Sunday when they had a serious altercation, which climaxed to the point of filing for a divorce.
Being from different states in India, Ankita and Vishal had different food preferences and that never became the reason for an argument until recently when Ankita saw Vishal up-voting Misal Pav as the best food in a poll on Facebook that included Rajma Chawal as an option as well. After trying everything to convince Vishal, Ankita cooked a plateful of delicious Rajma Chawal for him but to no avail as later in the evening Vishal ordered Misal Pav when the two of them were out for a dinner date.
The couple approached a marriage counselor who also failed to reach to any conclusion as to which dish was better and suggested the couple to have Misal Pav in breakfast and Rajma Chawal for lunch. Currently, Ankita has granted seven days to Rohan for changing his mind failing which she’ll be processing the divorce case as per their tacit agreement.
Ankita and Rohan’s case may seem like an isolated one, but data says that an increasing number of couples are getting separated due to different food preferences. Another couple from Chandigarh has filed for a divorce due to one of them not being tea addict.

"Bride in U.P sees groom chewing gutkha during rituals, cancels marriage, says he din't share gutkha with her","A girl refused to marry a man for chewing gutkha in Murarpatti village in Uttar Pradesh’s Ballia district, leaving the groom surprised and her relatives shocked over the weekend. The incident has raised hopes for women empowerment in U.P, but the reason of the refusal is more shocking. Faking News has found that the girl cancelled the marriage as his husband-to-be dint share gutkha with her.
Use of gutkha is prevalent across the country with U.P being a major market. In fact the first decision which the new government in U.P took after coming to power was to ban gutkha and pan masala in government premises, but banning it in remote villages still remains a distant reality. Murapatti village is not an exception with most men chewing gutkha since childhood.
Shwetank Singh, whose marriage was fixed some 1 month back thought his bride-to-be would be knowing about this gutkha-eating habit and so he dint make efforts to tell her about it. But he was caught while the rituals were going on. The girl saw Shwetank chewing gutkha and asked the panditji to stop the rituals right away. She even started walking out of the marriage venue leaving oarents from both sides shocked. It was only later that her parents found about the reason for this shocking decision. Apparently, Shwetank’s wife-to-be is also a gutkha lover and she found it embarrassing that her husband dint share it with her.
Our Faking News reporter spoke to the girl today and she had this to say, ” marriage is based on sharing things, be it happiness, sorrows or small pleasures of life and gutkha is an important part. My problem is not that my husband chews gutkha, but how can he chew it without even offering me some of it. I will only marry a person who knows the art of eating gutkha together with his wife.”
We are trying to reach government officials for comments on this incident, but they are busy chewing gutkha and cant speak now.",SOCIETY
Delhi guy involved in road rage get wildcard entry to Boxing event at Asian games,"In yet another boost to India’s chances of getting gold at the Asian Games, Delhi guy Rakesh Singh will be a surprise participant at the Boxing event this year.
Rakesh was involved in road rage at Chandni Chowk after his car brushed an SUV a busy intersection. Though the guys in the SUV were twice his size, Rakesh managed to throw some deft punches which caught them by surprise. As usual,  eyewitnesses not only enjoyed the road rage but some took videos and shared in on social media.
The video got a million hits on social media. Sports Minister Rajavardhan Rathore, who is pretty active on social media, couldn’t help but comment on how impressed he was with the video. “I am a sportsman and I can spot budding talent at the snap of a finger. That guy has some serious talent,” he tweeted.
Speaking on sending ‘Rocky’ for the Asian Games, Mr. Rathore said, “One of our boxer has caught a stomach bug and most probably wont be participating in a scheduled event. I have spoken to the authorities at the games and they are open to last minute entries. If he can just repeat his road rage performance, I can say we have another gold in our tally.”
The news led to many young men from Delhi sharing their ‘rage videos’ on social media. Some even calling for a talent hunt on the lines of Indian Idol for those who take road rage seriously.",SOCIETY
Girl patches up with boyfriend after noticing that he's not sad with the breakup,"Pune: In a surprising incident a girl patched up with her ex-boyfriend within hours of breakup only because the boyfriend showed no signs of heartache. 
Tanuja, a software engineer in Pune based MNC had been seeing the startup-management guy Vivek, since past seven months. Both were having a gala time until Vivek got so engrossed in his work that he failed to provide enough of his time to Tanuja. When even after multiple bluff-breakup threats, constant cribbing and sarcastic taunts flopped at getting Vivek’s attention, Tanuja finally decided to call it off.
Things, however, did not go as planned and in fact, went in a totally opposite direction of what Tanuja had expected. Vivek did not feel guilty about not being able to commit time and attention to Tanuja and if truth be told, turned more focused towards his work after the breakup. Tanuja was even more disturbed when she realized that breakup isn’t making Vivek sad, so she decided to make things miserable for him again and patched up with him.
Faking News reporter spoke to Tanuja’s flatmate Neha, with whom Tanuja usually shares all her secrets. Neha provided us an insight into a woman’s mind saying “Look the thumb rule is if your boyfriend is not happy the relationship is good, if he’s happy even when you are nagging then he’s probably seeing someone else too. So it is essential that you must make sure that he’s suffering at all times. He should also feel guilty and apologetic even when the mistake is yours. And after a breakup, he should be the one calling you up, begging for forgiveness. Just because of Tanuja’s bad timing, things didn’t roll out as anticipated. I have suggested her to get back with Vivek and dump him when there’s lesser workload on him. This way he will learn a lesson for life!”
Tanuja and Vivek’s story has a lot to tell. These days people see each other not only out of love or attraction but also try to micro-manage each other. Tanuja’s is exactly trying to do the same with Vivek. Sooner or later we all learn that relationships cannot be remote-controlled like a television set.
However, the millennials don’t get it and most people learn only after getting their first heartbreak. Technology is to be blamed.",SOCIETY
Delhi constructs new sky scraper with help of Swachh Bharat,"Move over Burj Khalifa, Empire state building or Eiffel tower. Our country will soon be the first to construct a sky scraper using scraped and waste resources.
You could have heard of reusable resources, green construction, or whatever, but our country has set goals for the environment that will send shivers down every single developed country, especially the organizations campaigning for global warming and green tribunals.
Yes, Delhi’s Garbage dump is now just 8 meters short of reaching Qutub Minar’s altitude. Once this is achieved, progress will be ten-fold. Schemes like Swachh Bharat which focuses more on how to take selfie while cleaning tissue papers in toilet and post on FB are one of the reasons for the garbage dump growth as per various Gov officials who take care of the waste management.
Delhi has already surpassed the toxic levels of living and terrorists are toying with idea of doing reseach on Delhi’s air pollution as they are easy means of kill. Now all that the waste management officials have to do is to concentrate all dumping at Ghazipur and we could build our own sky scraper.

Bishops & Imam protest against SC quashing Section 377,"While the entire nation was welcoming the ruling by Supreme Court quashing the Section 377, few voices were heard protesting it vociferously. Coming together are Delhi Archbishop Anil Couto, Archdiocese of Gandhinagar archbishop Thomas Macwan, Imam Noor ur Rahman Barkati from Kolkata.
While Anil Couto earlier wanted Christians to pray and fast on every Friday for the “spiritual renewal” of the nation ahead of next year’s general elections, Thomas Macwan issued a directive to defeat ‘Nationalist Forces” and prevent them from “taking over the country”. The more direct and radical Imam Barkati earlier in the news after he warned ‘Jihad’ against India, if India is declared a Hindu State.
Detailing their objections, the most articulate of the three was Anil Couto, who viewed the scrapping of colonial era act Section 377 as directly infringing on the minority religions. “Homosexuality is a sin by the book. The Church can never accept the unnatural practices by humans against the order of the God. Homosexuality is also treated the same way in Islam too”, he explained.
“See how the nation is celebrating this verdict. Even RSS has said homosexuality is not a crime, but only unnatural. Hindus have constantly evolving practices and customs. However, for Abrahamic religions the doctrine is fixed and cannot be amended the way like countries amend their constitutions” he reasoned out.
Seconding him was Imam Barkati, who felt the poor in minorities, who are vulnerable to become victims of homosexual predators would deviate from the main stream and this may result ever increasing population of Muslims in India. “This is a clever ploy by the Modi government to prune the minority population. The CJI, who was a Modi man was playing the role of liberal but only furthering the Hindutva agenda”.
It was then Archdiocese of Gandhinagar jumped into the discussion. “Yesterday I saw Ashok row Kavi, the oldest self-proclaimed gay was celebrating on television. You know, he is a staunch supporter of RSS. This entire drama was orchestrated by RSS. They intend to legalise and promote same-sex marriages only to reduce our population”.
When questioned if it is only about reducing population, even Hindus would reduce, Imam Barkati became angry and shouted “But, they are already so many. Even after continuously importing Bangladeshis and allowing polygamy for seven decades, Hindus remain more than 70% in this country. The rate of reduction in growth rate would be equal and thus put minorities in a disadvantaged position in the long run”.
He added “If Modi government doesn’t bring an amendment to constitution to keep Secion 377, the way they overruled the SC/ST ruling by the Supreme Court, I have no option but to initiate a Jihad”.
It was then Anil Couto asked Barkati “Jihad against whom”?
Barkati scratched his beard and said “Everybody”.",SOCIETY
Females favour Whatsapp talk,"It was definitely an out of the ordinary case. In Uttar Pradesh’s Amroha district a marriage was allegedly broken off on an issue uncleared. However, excessive use of Whatsapp or dowry demand has been alleged with this bizarre development. Whatsapp seems to be overshadowing dowry demand. If it was right, it could be a warning signal to the females who normally keep themselves emotionally involved with this online application.
Though it is a widely used handy method for sheltering in uninterrupted conversation, the females despite knowing the phrase ‘excess of everything is bad’ hooks up with the application even after a limit. It is the modern-day faster application revolutionising the course of women’s nature.
Earlier, they used to pass the free time in a face-to-face group conversation. Their tendency has completely reversed now. They prompt to conclude their impromptu talks through the Whatsapp way.
When they seemingly get tired in typing their mixed alphabets along with emojis, they begin resorting to the voice message. Because it was over and over again said that the fingers turned tired but the women’s mouth can never tire out, so they continue to pander to the voice message. It can be full of meaning, loud or irregularly growly. They switch it with their dizzying speed in accordance with the receiver. They did not hesitate in stepping over the line from the naughty fun to an acerbic jibe.
The peculiarities in the adverse situation of marriage pointed to both the causes. It was alleged that the bride remained terribly connected with Whatsapp. The bridegroom’s side claimed that the marriage was snapped owing to bride’s Whatsapp addiction. She was sending her messages to her in-laws even before the wedding. Are females directing their affinity with the electronic devices? Their liking for social media appears to be increasing.",SOCIETY
PTM: Dissection day for students,"After a lengthy wait, his turn came to know of the teacher’s exact opinion regarding the ward studying in the junior class at one of the prestigious schools in the Cantonment area. He was standing before the class teacher but she was busy conversing with other parents. The moment she turned her face he lost no time in asking, “What about this boy, madam?” The occasion was definitely the school’s Parent-Teacher Meeting. With a blinking pause, she uttered that he was a lazy boy.
This was not so much bitter conclusion as it was a direct telling of what she would have decided to say. Upon hearing the class teacher’s one-word postulation the boy’s father added that he was shy too.
It is seconds later, the genial teacher without delay proceeded to further speak that he was both shy and lazy. The little student feeling utterly relaxed as he had faced not enough embarrassment before his father.
He became so dysphoric that the tears were stinging his eyes by listening to the hard way the teacher was telling the wards’ flaws which caused even the most talkative and stylish mothers to maintain silence at the time.
Each parent listening own ward’s story between the fears and anxieties was supposed to be thinking unexpected. While the wards in their precocious minds pondered that Jesus Christ did certainly not die for their kind of disobedience.
The PTM is, of course, a day of appraisal for every individual student as the teacher, the pupil and the parents stand face to face. At this time, it is only the class teacher speaks and others listen attentively. Undeniably, Kabir’s couplet about the value of tutor rebounded in the parents’ minds when they found themselves standing meekly before the teacher so long as her fume continued.",SOCIETY
Road mishap due to biker not breaking lane rules,"In a road accident near Hinjewadi, Faking news reporters pulled out in depth information of what exactly happened and the cause was quite bizarre!
When interviewed, the project manager with nearby IT company expressed his disbelief on how a biker can be so disciplined.
Mr. Vishwanathan said “I was returning from office in my brand new Maruti Alto.”
He explained “Based on my experience of how bikers drive across the lanes, I was sure that the biker ahead of me will take the serpentine route and win the race of reaching home first. I kept driving my new Alto at consistent speed.”

Shelter homes incidents are shocking,"Shelter homes abuse cases erupt like seismic disturbance. Whether it be Bihar or Uttar Pradesh there is strong affinity in an intensity of the shelter homes abuse cases. None can defy it in whatever ways. It was nothing less than the seismic activity. The rival parties were bent upon raising the serious slips in shielding the girls.
On the one hand, Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar, holds the system responsible for the Muzzafarpur episode, while on another hand, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, UP Minister for Child Welfare and Women, pointed finger at not a closure of the girls’ shelter home in Deoria despite the strict order.
A total of 42 girls were reportedly staying in the house, of which as many as 18 were missing and 24 were rescued. The Bihar figure was a little bigger. However, the union minister Maneka Gandhi has raised demand for a centralised shelter home.
The hapless girls were ultimate sufferers and victims in both the pertinent cases. By offering them a dependable shelter in the govt-run shelter homes, they were made confident of getting a helping hand but what was continuing in those homes was wholly intention driven. Was the government machinery so redundant in noticing the immoral things? It was the Tata Institute’s report on Bihar case which opened the time-consuming closed eyes. The UP case remained running despite plain reports of illegality proved after a CBI enquiry.
The candles were burnt to demonstrate unity in condemning the heartless and merciless incidents in both the prominent states. If Tejaswi Yadav said of demon-raj, he was not altogether incorrect.

Fear freezes mind,"Fear of anything freezes the effective mind in a jiffy. Sometimes the situation blocks up our mental ability to find an immediate solution at the critical moment. If one returns completely safe from such a dangerous situation, it is certainly because of one’s ready mindedness at that time. Various reports in regard to the appearance of reptiles in homes were being received these days.
Just a day or two days ago one 35-year-old Gurugram woman was wholly surprised to see a five-foot-long male Indian black python coiled up in her kitchen. When the resident picked up the gas lighter to ignite the burner, she spotted something moving under it. It was a fright of her life.
She took at least ten minutes to recuperate from sudden dread. As it was only after then she alerted her husband and immediate neighbours. She accepted that it was for the first time she had seen a reptile in her life. Also, this was the first time a python was found in the city’s house. Her presence of mind worked as she informed the authorities concerned for necessary act though it was delayed much.
Lately, we got to know how a woman finds herself in the midst of a python on her bed in London. It was a very, very horrible spectacle for her. The English woman was bewildered to find a 3-feet python by her side on the bed in a flat in Kensington, West London. It was also a fright of her life. She must have been a strong-hearted lady that she jumped out of the bed screaming and shrieking after catching sight of the curled up snake. While darting away from the room she did not forget to close the room door. She showed enough courage in tackling the terrible situation.
Similarly, some time ago a fashionable woman suddenly saw a monkey standing before her in the house. She started crying throatily till the primate did not run away from the entrance of her flat at the third storey of a building. Was her screaming with full intensity scared the monkey?

Arguments need sagacity,"Communal considerations definitely dominate our mind. If our politicians reap advantage from such kind of thinking, the people are also not aloof from the effect. Gone are the days when the passengers never thought of conversing on communal angles.
While travelling in a train, it was realised how the passengers preferred to converse on communal matters. Politics has certainly influenced the people’s minds much. But there was no paucity of persons who take the conversation in a right direction. What was needed was an ability to argue. A flabby-bodied, moustache-bearing and spectacled man in his seventies was seated on the train’s general bogie seat. The train was running with its signal-suggesting speed. It was either too slow or too fast. One could say he took space of two persons visibly.
As the crowd of the passengers was surging after each stoppage, every new entrant urged him to make some space for sitting but he made an excuse of extreme knee pain. Looking at his older age none made a fuss of the situation by indulging in unnecessary arguments. Meanwhile, another older passenger’s arrival in the compartment brought the people conversing on different topics. That aged man allayed the tensed atmosphere through his attention-grabbing talk. Strangely enough, the plump person disagreed totally with the views of sagacious man. There were references from the mythological scripts, Kabir’s couplets, Tulsidas’ chaupai and so on. His stories hinted at the insight the readers usually find in the Panchatantra Tales. Despite his intelligent logical arguments, the pot-bellied man heckled continuously.
The portly man was enveloping his talk around the political opinions pervading in the country. In a rush of words, he expressed words annoying the passengers but they laughed out his points. Is it not a reality that Muslims still influence results of as many as 150 parliamentary seats.",SOCIETY

"Guy claims to actually like engineering, ostracized by everyone","A young man from a well-known Engineering college has been ostracized, shunned from his social groups after he claimed to actually like Engineering. It is believed that the reaction  was aggravated because the said person was from Mechanical Engineering.
The young man, whose identity has been kept hidden for safety purposes, is currently pursuing Bachelor’s in Engineering (final year) and wishes to opt for a Master’s in Engineering as well.
The triggering incident occurred in the wee hours. The man and a couple of his classmates were discussing the syllabus for the upcoming academic year on a WhatsApp group when someone cursed Engineering. This one complaint led to a series of slurs and expletives by other members of the group. One person reportedly said opting Engineering was the biggest mistake of his life. This in turn, led to a string of messages conveying sympathy. Another person said he will probably begin writing poetry after he is done with this ‘shit’. This garnered a lot of encouragement, says a reliable source. It was when the man in question wrote, ‘It’s not shit, I like it. C’mon, it’s not that bad!’ that led to an explosion. To add to the fuel, he actually wrote, ‘We all chose to be here for one reason or another’. It was followed by a string of derogatory messages which are unsuitable for publishing.
The final nail came when someone from the group said sarcastically that ‘Yeh toh masters ke liye jaayega'(this one will go for a Master’s degree) and the man actually said ‘Yes wahi plan hai mera toh’ (yes, that is my plan); this eventually led to the man’s removal from the WhatsApp group.
The young man faced snickers and stares at his college the next day. Although he tried to ignore it, the tension and hostility were palpable, sources say.
He is currently under a secure environment where only his closest friends and family can reach him. Some of his friends who like Engineering as much as he does are treating the incident as a warning. ‘He is being extremely strong. I wouldn’t last a day’, says one friend, whose identity has been kept under-wraps, again for safety purposes. ‘He set an example by saying what he wanted to do, but at what cost?’, asks another one.
The people who have ostracized him on the other hand think it’s just a phase. ‘Too much stress does that too you’, says one member from the WhatsApp group. ‘He needs an intervention’, says another member, obviously concerned. One member, when asked by the reporter what he felt about the man’s plans, folded his hands and looked skywards, and said, ‘This too shall pass.’
The incident has created tension amongst the students of the said Engineering college, as it has been alleged that there is an underground support for the man who likes Engineering, despite a very vocal opposition for the same.",SOCIETY

People from all over the country showed up to mourn(celebrate) the death of ram’s brother. Some were his close relatives, some his friends.

Monument given new colour,"An Ayodhya-type situation lurks in South Delhi village. When Delhi’s Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia turned out to be a little sterner in the medieval-era tomb matter, the ground reality has surfaced. It might be referred to the Religious Committee of the Delhi government’s Home Department.
The sheer reality comes to the fore without any disagreement. The harm has certainly been caused to the 15th-century tomb which has existed in Safdarganj’s Humayunpur village. This tomb has even got a mention in a rare book of the historical value. How has a tomb converted into a temple is a case of pure analysis? However, the list of monuments prepared by Maulvi Zafar Hasan for ASI has listed it as the monument no 335.
Somewhat latest version of the Ayodhya-type situation appeared to have happened in South Delhi. Whatever reports indicate is clear enough to admit of something incorrect considered in March this year. Something really communal is happening to mainstream secular culture.
A small domed tomb of the Tughlaq-era has turned into a Shiva temple with idols placed inside in the month of March. Even the colour of the monument was also changed into white and saffron with a view to giving it a complete transformation.
One cannot paint, draw or whitewash any wall in and around the monument and also cannot hamper or spoil the originality of the monument, states categorically the Citizen Charter of the department of archaeology. Therefore its transformation is a complete violation of the Charter.
Turning a monument into a religious structure is a land grab issue, as has been put in plain words. But how can it be resolved? It is not supposed to be only one case of its kind. The AAP leader’s keen interest brought the truth in a state-notified heritage structure at last.",SOCIETY

The 30 year old business man from Mira Road, who is a regularly commutes by local train, asked for a single buttock in his next birth in his prayers. The reason for this unique request was to enable him to sit as the fourth passenger on a local train seat meant for three.
Speaking to Faking News Hiren said, “I have been travelling by train since last ten years. And all the seats are already taken when I enter the compartment. Leaving me with that uncomfortable fourth seat, where one of my buttock in left hanging without support. By the end of the day I am left with one sore butt. So my only prayer to the almighty is to give me just one buttock.”
Hiren’s request struck a chord with many other passengers who have been braving heavy rush in local trains for all these years. A city based cosmetic surgeon even offered to surgically remove one of Hiren’s buttock free of charge. “Why wait for the next birth. I will help this man in this life itself,” said the doctor.

“I remember once I had an argument with a man after he cut me in traffic. We were talking like gentlemen and sorting the issue when some bystanders got restless and asked when are we going to start fighting. They were not happy with our politeness and wanted to hear some cuss words,” he recollected.

Supreme Court judges visit Republic TV studio to wish Arnab on Teachers Day ,"A group of Supreme Court judges today visited Republic TV studios to express their gratitude to Arnab Goswami on the occasion of Teachers Day.

While speaking to Faking News a senior judge said, “We owe it to Arnab for teaching us the intricacies of law. In fact I have been watching his debates from the time he was in Times Now. His inimitable style and relentless pursuit to shout down opposition helped my skills. It would be an understatement to say that he is ‘one man law college’.

Arnab himself looked embarrassed with the adulation coming his way and while replying to questions from media-persons said that he was passionate about delivering justice and will continue to do so till his last breath.
When asked if he had any future plans to join Supreme Court he said, “I am happy doing my bit for the judiciary from my news studio itself. No plans to replace the Chief Justice as of now.”",MEDIA
"All India Radio plays an old recording of Mann Ki Baat, nobody notices the difference","New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s monthly Mann Ki Baat program was aired yesterday for what was supposed to be the 47th edition of the program. However, due to a mix up at All India Radio (AIR), an old episode from 2015 was aired on the radio. Surprisingly, none of the listeners noticed any difference and this mix-up was identified when Mr. Modi himself listened to a recording later in the evening.
Mann Ki Baat is one of the most popular programs on AIR with all the BJP MLAs and MPs tuning in to listen to the show every month. BJP is likely to issue a show cause notice to all of them now for failing to identify the old episode. There are also expected to be mass firings in AIR for the mix-up.
Speaking to Faking News on the condition of anonymity, a BJP MP said, “Saheb is very angry that nobody noticed it was an old recording. He now suspects that we never paid any attention to what he was saying and slept through his mann ki baat. This blunder by AIR has exposed us all and put our ticket for 2019 elections in jeopardy.”
“We could have made some excuse if we hadn’t reacted during the show but all of us went online and praised Modi Ji’s vision and statements during yesterday’s Mann Ki Baat. Now they are asking if we paid so much attention to the show then why couldn’t we identify the old recording. It was some episode from 2015, he talks so much, how can we keep track of all his statements whether something was said yesterday or 3 years ago,” the worried MP added.
Meanwhile, worried that others may have also missed his Mann Ki Baat, Narendra Modi is planning a mega Mann Ki Baat featuring all the episodes till date which will be played instead of the commentary during the next India-England Test. PM Modi thinks this is the best way to get everyone to hear the show.",MEDIA
Buzzfeed writer who wrote '7 ways to increase traffic on your article' gets fired for not getting enough traffic on his article,"Mumbai: The current format on the internet which is a rage are the listicles on almost every topic, even on the topis where actually lists don’t make any sense. 7 ways to tell if your husband loves you or not, 9 ways to keep your job, 11 ways to get the perfect photo of Taimur and what not. I mean why can’t there be 12 ways to keep our job, why is it only 9, what research went into finding out that there are only 9 ways.
A recent list published on a famous platform ‘Buzzfeed’ literally took away the job of a writer. Yes, Shwetank Srivastava had to lose his job as he didn’t get enough traffic on his article. Shwetank had been under pressure since long to deliver a hit article but was losing connect with his audience. After a lot of research and discussions with the technology team at his office, he wrote a piece on ways to get good traffic on your article if you are a writer. He wrote it with interest and described the 7 ways aesthetically. In fact, the editorial team at Buzzfeed was quite impressed with his list and thought that this is the article which will help him hold on to his job.
But the internet has a funny way of operating. Sometimes the most boring stories get you enough traffic and sometimes the interesting ones don’t fetch a penny. And Shwetank went through the later. His story was one of the least traffic generating pieces in the history of Buzzfeed articles. And the most feared moment actually arrived when he received a mail from his editor saying he is no longer required in the team. We hope that at least the people who read about Shwetank’s article would get good traffic on their articles.",MEDIA
IT company fires 80 employees who quietly left for home during mock fire drill,"Around 80 employees from an IT company in Bengaluru were given marching orders after they quietly left for home while mock fire drill was being conducted at the office premises. The drill was conducted to check fire readiness in case of emergency. And as per instructions, all employees were expected to assemble in the parking lot for a briefing by the fire department.
But post the drill it was observed that most cubicles in the office were empty. That is when HR decided to take attendance where it was found that 80 employees left for the day without informing their seniors.
Livid top management then took the decision to relieve the absconders of their duties. Many of those who got fired are from middle management.
When Faking News tried speaking to the HR they tried to downplay the incident. “Layoffs are part of the IT industry and this particular case of 80 employees is a routine downsizing exercise and is not related to the mock fire drill,” said the Chief HR Officer.
But internal mails accessed by our reporter tell a different story. Apparently, many employees took the excuse of fire drill and were found in a nearby shady bar and restaurant. Few others were spotted in a movie theater.
In their defense, the employees say that the mock drill was conducted on Friday when most employees anyway leave early. But that excuse doesn’t seem to be cutting any ice with the company at the moment. The employees who actually got fired in a fire drill are now planning to write to the CM of the state seeking his intervention.",MEDIA
Social Media furious with BCCI for including Team India in Anushka's pic ,"Social media erupted with criticism after an image of Team India with Anushka was shared by BCCI. The image shows the actress dressed in a green saree alongside the Indian cricketing team.
The High Commission of India in London hosted Anushka Sharma on Tuesday, however it is not yet clear as to why players from Indian team were present when they were clearly not invited.
Sources say that Anushka may have extended the invitation to Virat and rest of the freeloaders tagged along. But social media lost its cool and many were not happy with the players for ruining Anushka’s event and invading her personal space.
Given their disastrous performance in Edgbaston, shouldn’t they be spending more time in nets? questioned one twitter user.
Horrible in tests but perform well in IPL. These players are not interested in playing for the country. The only thing that motivates them is Ghee and Ghapa-ghap, tweeted another user
Many tagged External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and requested her to cancel the passport of the team players and support staff for ruining Anushka’s evening.
“A woman cannot even attend an event without men surrounding her. How bad can things be,” commented a well known feminist.
With pressure from Govt officials, BCCI tendered an apology and clarified team players will be given strict instructions that they will not accompany their wives on foreign trips and trespass any official event.",MEDIA
Man who hated TV serials without watching finds them to be way better than news channels,"Bengaluru: Chirag, a techie deliberately reached home late by spending his evenings in traffic jams to avoid confrontation with his wife Pooja over TV remote who loved watching TV serials.
One day when Pooja was not around as she went to her parent’s place, bored with noisy news channels Chirag switched to a TV serial Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai. From that day, no more news channels for Chirag, he is an avid serial watcher more than Pooja.
“Naira and Kartik’s chemistry (Chief protagonists of the serial) took my migraine pain away in no time. I was completely hooked to the serial till the end. I don’t know why I hated TV serials without watching even one episode”, said Chirag.
He added, “Who wants to watch some Maulana shouting at some Pandit, Sambit crying out there because Abhishek Manu Singhvi forgot to address him, a dear friend of me. Some hopeless panelist from Pakistan, never understand why they come to news channels to get thrashed by every Tom, Dick and Harry. Serials are so good. Your ears remain perfect, no need to look for an aspirin tablet either”.
It was not an easy switch for Chirag either, “Thoda adjust karne mein time laga as they were rotating camera to show every character’s face expression out there in clockwise and anti-clockwise motion. Once you get accustomed it’s all fine, smooth ride from then”.
Though Chirag and Pooja are enjoying serials together, some khadoos staying next door still watch Arnab whose high pitch voice can reach basement car parking even if TV is switched on 10th floor.
“Our apartment association has made a strict rule, no more Arnab or his ilk’s in prime time. If you have to, like some cases doctors advise low BP patients to listen to Arnab regularly, you must make your TV room soundproof”, said Chirag before rushing inside to watch Kumkum Bhagya episode number 1155.",MEDIA
BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra's family comes to meet him in newsroom after he fails to return home for a week,"BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra had an emotional reunion with his family after they turned up at the newsroom of a local media house. Sources say that it was a desperate attempt by the family after Sambit failed to return home for a week.
Dubbed as a permanent fixture on news debates, Sambit has been hopping across newsrooms to represent BJP, which has led to some anxious moments for his family. There was a thought of lodging a missing person complaint at the local police station. But then someone suggested that we check out the local news studio.
“We don’t get to see him for weeks. Sometimes he doesn’t pick up our calls. So we thought of coming to the news studio to get a glimpse. His aunt has even prepared his favorite dish, which hopefully we will all sit together and have,” said a cousin.
Family members have made attempts to get close to Mr. Patra on earlier occasions  too. Once, his uncle turned up as panelist on the debate to have a conversation with him. Others have been sending him messages through Arnab.
“Even when he is at home he is in the ‘debate mode’. Most of the time with his hand raised and saying ‘allow me to speak’. That too when no one is interrupting him,” Sambit’s maternal uncle said with concern.
In his defence Sambit Patra said that with so many news channels, his job as a spokesperson is not easy.
But his family is not having any of his excuses and is now planning to construct a newsroom inside their house and invite Sambit as a panelist to somehow get him to return home.",MEDIA
"Hearing loud noise neighbors call cops suspecting domestic violence, later find family watching Arnab’s debate","Bengaluru: Prakash and Richa who recently returned from UK called Police helpline after they heard loud noise from their neighbor’s house. Much to the embarrassment of Prakash and Richa, Police patrolling team after knocking on the neighbor’s door found the family happily enjoying when republic TV’s flagship program ‘The Debate with Arnab Goswami’ was running in the background.
“Itna noise sun ke mein ghabara gayee, that’s when I called Prakash”, said Richa who returned to India last weekend after spending more than twenty years with her hubby.
“I thought it is my responsibility to inform Police. Someone with a male voice was screaming “I won’t let you go on this right now, now tell me, you want to make a damn personal comment on me, show me the proof …, you cannot make a comment like this and get away’. To my balcony this man’s voice was coming loud and clear, others what were they speaking I was not getting as they were speaking at the same time”, said Prakash.
Prakash did not know the man who on live TV was ‘teaching’ one his panelist about his integrity was none other than Mr. Arnab Goswami, the man who is helping many ENT specialists to run their clinics successfully in India.
Prakash and Sarita who were planning to go out of town on a long weekend were not getting a reliable security guard to look after their house. When Prakash talked to Sujith, one of his office colleague about it, Sujith said, “Arre bhai, Arnab ka show ko tata sky pe recording kar,  aur repeat mein play kar raat bhar.

Indian girl with CWG gold questions journalists who didn't ask mandatory question 'when are you settling down?',"New Delhi: Indian girls who brought so much glory for India in the recently concluded common wealth games were bugged by questions by media people they were not prepared for. While meeting the press upon their arrival at Indira Gandhi international airport from Australia, many felt media was asking them ‘out of syllabus’ questions.
“None of us who are ‘still’ unmarried got questions like, when are you getting married, when and where you are going to settle down? Even my married colleagues were not asked basic questions like when they are going to start family”, said Renu Yadav one of the gold medal winner in the event.
Renu added, “These are the questions I was preparing for last three days by going through different interviews available in YouTube. It seems all my effort has gone waste”.
One journalist asked her how many hours of practice do you every day. How many kilograms do you lift. When Renu told 60 kilograms in gym, the journalist was surprised.
Renu quickly clarified she is not a weight lifter, she is a wrestler who won a gold medal last week. Journalist apologized saying, except men’s cricket team members, all other sportspersons look same for her”.
While the press conference was on-going, an IPL team made a brief stopover at the airport on their way to Jaipur. Seeing the familiar faces, most of the journalists ran towards the players and coach to get some material for their respective news channels.
The journalist for whom all non-cricketing sportspersons look the same said, “Actually my sources in BCCI pointed out the IPL team will be here any time after 10 AM. As their flight got delayed, bore ho rahi thi, that’s why I attended this common wealth games medalists press conference. By the way who will remember these sportspersons who come to our notice once in four years. Look at our cricketers, always in news. Public loves them so much they know their pet names as well as their pet’s names”.",MEDIA
News channel using man from North East Delhi as expert for debate on elections in North East India,"New Delhi: In a historic day for Indian media, North East India dominated the news cycle the entire day. Counting of votes for Nagaland, Meghalaya and Tripura assembly elections managed to do what even massive flooding of some states in that part of India never could, force news channels to cover North East India. However, this led to a unique problem for news channels, they had to bring in experts from North East India to discuss the results and they were not readily available in Delhi.
While some news channels stuck to their regular panel which debates everything from weddings of celebrities to Nuclear power to space travel, some invited the first 5 people from North East that they could find in Delhi. However, one news channel decided to invite a resident of Dilshad Garden in North East Delhi to discuss the election results.
Explaining the decision, the chief editor said ,”Delhi is India and India is Delhi so it doesn’t really matter if the person is from Dilshad Garden or Agartala. Important thing is that like a responsible news channel, we gave representation to North East. Tyranny of distance may stop us from fully covering that part of India but we still managed to do the best that we could.”
Recalling his experience in the debate, the noted ‘expert’ said ,”It was very easy to contribute to the discussion despite knowing nothing about Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland. I just had to say some party’s name loudly and then others in the panel cut me off and started shouting. I really should think about becoming a full time panellist on these shows.”
Meanwhile, crew of a news channel reached Mizoram to cover these assembly elections where they were shocked to learn that no elections are taking place and they have reached the wrong state.",MEDIA
Indian woman marries Pakistani man Arnab Goswami airs black screen to condemn situation,"It was a usual, noisy weeknight until Republic TV co-founder Arnab Goswami decided to turn the tide by airing a black screen. Reportedly, the unprincipled showman masquerading as a journalist aired the black screen to condemn a marriage between an Indian woman and a Pakistani man.
An upset Goswami, who has maintained a stiff stand against Pakistan, shouted that the woman is ‘anti-national’ while airing the black screen.
Earlier, journalist Ravish Kumar had aired a black screen during his show to condemn Indian news channels’ sorry reportage of the JNU sloganeering incident. However, Goswami chose to air the black screen to denounce the growing harmony between the neighbouring nations. On the other hand, Ravish ran a black screen to condemn Goswami’s uncalled decision to run the black screen.
Many Ravish fans have reportedly forgotten the journalist’s appearance after his frequent stints of airing a black screen. “In the last two years, watching Ravish’s show feels like listening to the radio. The last time I saw him on air, he had black hair. I no more know how he looks, all thanks to the radio broadcasts,” said a fan, who claimed to watch news over Arnab Goswami’s channel.
A raging Goswami also wrote to the External Affairs Ministry to divorce the newly-married couple. While blaming the ISI for the cross-border affair, Goswami, in his letter to the ministry, shouted, “THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. THIS LOVE JIHAD, AND NOT FACTORS LIKE GST AND DEMONETISATION, HAS AFFECTED THE ECONOMY ADVERSELY. I REQUEST MY GOVERNMENT TO BRING BACK THE WOMAN TO INDIA. IF SHE DOESN’T COME BACK, PM NARENDRA MODI MUST DECLARE A WAR ON PAKISTAN; HE HAS MY CONSENT TO DO SO.”
The Narendra Modi-led NDA government released a press statement in wake of the appeal made by Goswami. “Our government has been working to extradite fugitives like Vijay Mallya and Modi (Nirav) since 2014. However, extradition of the woman looks comparatively simpler, and we must accomplish it soon. It will also form our agenda for the 2019 Loksabha Elections, alongside Ram Mandir,” read the statement.",MEDIA
RJ loses job after playing two songs without any ad break in-between,"Intolerance is indeed rising in India. No we do not mean religious intolerance but intolerance at work. People are being fired for all petty reasons. It was just last week when an RJ was fired from a famous radio station simply because he played two songs without break.
Kashish Bhardwaj Aka RJ Kash lost his job in Radio Mirchi after he played 2 songs consecutively without any Ad break. He was fired immediately after the incident that took place last Wednesday.
We talked to his boss and also Radio Mirchi Delhi’s manager Mr Gautam Chabra. Mr Chabra said, “Kash was a hardworking boy, but some rules are not meant to be broken. Advertisements are what we live for and no RJ can play two songs consecutively without break. We just can’t let our audience enjoy the songs one after the other, unless of course it’s midnight or a 4 AM FM show. This is the golden rule of all radio channels. Kash broke it and hence faced the consequences.”
We also talked to the victim Kashish who is now looking for other opportunities. Kash said, “I have been working in the Radio industry for 7 years. This is the first time when I got fired from a radio channel. These people are obsessed with advertisements. I understand their norms and rules but I was helpless as the song before the ad break was ‘Selfie of Dhinchak Pooja’. The song was so torturing that I closed my ears and didn’t notice when it ended and the new song began. They should reconsider my case or fire the person who put that song of Dhinchak Pooja in the playlist.”
This is not the first time such an incident has taken place regarding Radio advertisements. 5 years ago, an RJ was awarded promotion when he played an advertisement in between a song. Later he went on to become the CEO of that Radio channel.
In the dying culture of Radio (thanks to MP3 players and other song applications) a listener just wants to listen to songs with less ad breaks while driving. But Radio channels can’t even do that job perfectly. And when someone tries to break the shackles he is removed for that act. As they say you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.",MEDIA
5 Indian journalists arrested by Dubai Police for irritating policemen on duty,"Dubai: Ever since the news of Sridevi’s unfortunate death broke, several Indian journalists have been hounding the Dubai police for updates related to the case. In their quest to get more details from the police, 5 journalists went a step too far and have ended up in Bur Dubai police station’s lock up. Dubai police has said that these journalists were constantly irritating their officers and were stopping the policemen from carrying out their regular duties.
While some journalists were patiently waiting for updates on the autopsy, these journalists entered the police station and refused to leave till they got the latest updates. One of them even brought a bathtub inside the police station and started asking the officers if it was the same size as the bathtub in Sridevi’s hotel room. Another one, entered the bathroom inside the police station and started checking for bathtubs. After ignoring these antics for two days, Dubai police finally decided to arrest them to stop the chaos inside their police station.
As per media sources, these journalists were instructed by their editors that unless they get an exclusive detail unavailable to other channels, their return ticket to India won’t be paid by the media houses. This led to desperation and these journalists went overboard.
As per reports, all these journalists tried to tweet to EAM Sushma Swaraj before the arrest to get some help but all of them were blocked by Sushma Ji and the message didn’t reach her.",MEDIA
Politician sets up debate with a photo of Arnab Goswami to get some time to speak,"Anyone who is well versed with news or watches news channels knows who Arnab Goswami is. Arnab Goswami, an Ex- Times Now Journalist and current Editor of Republic TV, shot to fame with his New Hour Debate on Times Now.
With that show, he became famous, rather infamous, for his bold and audacious style of debating. He didn’t let anyone speak for more than a minute and asked hard hitting questions ferociously. Fearing this, Mumbai politician Ajay Gawade has set up a debate with a photo of Arnab Goswami in an attempt to get some time to speak.
This move didn’t come shocking to his party as his party believes that this is the only way a sane person can have a fruitful and wholesome debate with Arnab Goswami. We interviewed Mr. Gawade and here’s what he had to say.
“See before I made this decision, I had done my full home work. I have watched every debate of Arnab Goswami. In an interview of 60 minutes, Arnab speaks for an average 56.5 minutes while the interviewee gets to speak only for about 3.5 minutes. Just imagine getting to speak three and a half minutes in an hour long interview. What could you speak in 3.5 minutes? How would you present your view? The interview would then steer in Arnab’s direction and the only perception people would get about you from the interview would be dependent on the direction Arnab takes the interview in. So when I was approached by Republic TV for an interview with Arnab, I consulted with my party members and we unanimously reached a decision to set up a debate with a photo of Arnab rather than real-life Arnab,” he said.
Ajay Gawade further adds how he has been practicing for the debate, “See that podium? I have kept Arnab’s photo there. The expression on the face seems to change every time I look at it. See, when I was talking to the photo about my work as a politician, the photo had a sarcastic grin on the face. When I told Arnab’s photo to shut up and to not interrupt me in between, the face in the photo seemed turning red with anger. It’s almost like the photo is still talking to me the same way Arnab would.”
However, bizarre this may sound, but this debate would sure turn out to be one of its kinds. Catch the whole human-photo debate on Republic TV at sharp 9 p.m. on Saturday.",MEDIA
Taimur Ali Khan requests Virat-Anushka to give 'good news' soon to reduce the number of journalists following him,"Mumbai- Ever since he was born, Taimur Ali Khan has been making news every day. Whether it was his name, his smile, his sleep, his yawn, his vaccination, his milk bottle or even his diaper, journalists have been covering him more diligently than a Parliament session. Now he has had enough of all these journalists and want some privacy in his life. To get some journalists out of his life, he has now requested India’s most loved couple ‘Virushka’ to have a baby soon so that some journalists start covering every aspect of his life.
During the past year, only relaxed week away from the spotlight that Taimur had was when Virat and Anushka got married. All the leading journalists were busy covering him, giving him some privacy. That gave him the idea on how to reduce media coverage of his activities and he sent the request to both Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma. Virat is currently busy playing the Test series in South Africa and hasn’t responded to Taimur’s request.
As per a family insider, things were fine till they were reporting on his smile or face or sleep but when they didn’t even leave his diaper alone that he said enough is enough and this has to stop. Since reporters were unlikely to hear his plea, he took this option of approaching Virushka.
Meanwhile, several reporters outside Taimur’s residence were seen debating who will be the first one among them to get as Pulitzer Prize for excellent reporting on Taimur.",MEDIA
Pronouncing uncomfortably,"Why do we falter in pronouncing correctly over and over again? We embarrass others when the wrong tone of voice sprouts from our oral cavity. Even the Americans were not wholly perfect in this field of study. Pronouncing Nepal as ‘nipple’ and Burma as ‘button’, once Donald Trump, the American president, has changed originality in the name.
Though his aides corrected him, it was in a very firm strength of mind he would have made such mispronunciations. The name of Burma has changed into Myanmar; he picked both the names up in turn ineptly. It was grateful that he did not express each one’s quality.
If it was a mispronunciation on his part, he need not be too snobbish about it. However, his aides accepted that the mistake was the result of mispronunciations. Although the English Bard, William Shakespeare writes: What is in a name? Yet badly pronounced words were still derided.
Neither the Englishmen nor the Americans can escape from the use of distorted names for the South Asians. We typically find how the British changed the very originality of names in India. Examples abound in this regard.
Certain city names like Dacca, Bombay, Bangalore, Madras, Calcutta, and Pondicherry were different from its original accent. They pronounced it differently so spelt it in their own capable way. It someway created confusion and showed mockery.
What was wrongly perfect for them appeared odd in the indigenous tongue. Those entire names have now been changed into its original accent. If we see names like Lucknow, Cawnpore, and Varanasi, we shall quickly find the bare differentiation.
Correct cadence stood altered by the wrong pronunciation. They could feel the weight of incorrect words and could tell that it was even more unlikeable. However, there was a silver lining too when we happen to spot on some names as Allahabad in right pronunciation.",MEDIA
Modi is anti Dalit: Punya Prasoon Vajpaaye,"Our reporter, Narendra, got an opportunity to talk to Punya Prasoon Vaajpaaye who recently resigned from ABP news channel. Mr. PP told our reporter that he is being targetted by Modi because of his Dalit background.
Mr. PP told us the story of his struggle he had to go through to reach this success today. The story of how he used to stay till late night to interview villagers of India, twist what was said and then give the finishing touch to the story followed by finding anti Modi people to debate on prime time.
How hard he had to work for Sonia Gandhies to approve his work. It took him 4 years of fear mongering among muslims about Modi to become a member of Lutyen gang. And now Mr. PM has destroyed all that.
Mr. PP says his struggle in journalism has taught him to be brave and he will continue to serve his country as Ghandy are the people who made India even more developed and richer than other countries which got freedom during same time. Countries like Singapore and South Korea are hardly bettern than a dustbin while India is shining. All this to the fake Gandhis.
Mr. PP told our reporter the lady who said good things about modi was paid money to do so and this is how her income got double in very short period of time.
He also told us that he is an unbiased journalist which is evident from his reports against Sonia gandhi. In fact, he was so against Sonia that she never gave him an interview. He only had to go to her house to collect the monthly cheque.
According to Punya prasoon country is moving towards becoming very intolerant. He is afraid if Hindu population increases beyond 50% of total population, then India will have a situation like Seria because of intolerant nature of Hindus which is evident from the past 1300 years of history of hindu mindset.
We hope that PM understand the pain of this Dalit journalist and stop harassing him. He is doing nothing bad, just earning good fortune for himself. Besides It has always been considered a good thing for one to stay loyal to his/her master.",MEDIA
Enjoy fight scene on the TV,"We used to observe fight scene on a boxing ring or movies but the venue seemed to have been shifted now. It was apparent from the recent days fight in a TV studio. It was a fight between man and woman. The first spell of the slap was delivered by a woman and afterwards, the volleys of slaps were started showering from an angry man. The fight scenes were easily available on the news channels.
The educated gentry wanted air-conditioned dust-free space for the fierce fight. The traditional clay courts for showing physical fitness were no longer wanted by the human beings. The exchange of slaps between two mature people was surely extremes of too much. The guests were shifting towards physical aggression. There is everything going on in the name of political discussion. Discussion amid pressure, intensity, adverse responding was culminating into slapping audacity. Arguments were attracting cuff took us towards a new direction. The educated people were entangling into not only a verbal fight but also physical spar. The clamour that grew over some particular issue during TV debates permitted the political motive. The participants exploded with the complete contradiction of the balancing conversation.
A confrontational situation permeated and there was slapping, crying and shouting. The hot arguments aggravated into rather nasty. The politicians remain seated on the chairs for spreading their party views in every possible way which in turn usually strokes more excited disagreement. Who was more responsible for the fight? One communist party leader even said that a Maulana had been made villain needlessly while the woman slapped him first.

UP girls' grits gather glare,"Uttar Pradesh remained a focal centre of media attention owing to two different occasions. At both the places, the girls played the key role. One pair of sisters invoked the rain-god for the monsoon in Jhansi, while another duo swayed the listless district administrative authorities in Bhadohi.
If the two sisters in a village of Jhansi ploughed the dry barren field for the much-sought rainfall, another two sisters saddened with their father’s death in police lock-up forcibly raised their voice for justice in Bhadohi.
In Jhansi, two sisters were ploughing the desolate field with the sole purpose of soothing the unhappy rain-god. Their small village did not receive the essential requirement of the rainfall in the past about five years so they had taken the big task of the hard labour.
Adequate rainwater in the arid region was certainly required. “My sister and I have started ploughing the field so that we can appease the rain-god Indra for invoking the blessings upon us. It can also help us have a good harvest even,” said the elder sister with optimism. While in Bhadohi two sisters persuaded the administrative authorities for the justice against their father’s sudden death allegedly at the police station lately. The sisters started wailing and crying and not willing to wait for more time. They were in a deep shock.
They were not in any way accepting a lot of divergences but they visualised value in remaining true to themselves. Upon reflection, they realised they have lost their father who was the only earner for the poor family.
Their deeply complaining pale expressions whined their oral aggravations while stroking their chests. The district administration lastly came into action and treated their screams with more gravity. Their complaint was not neglected as the action against the police was taken.",MEDIA
Our politicians are always wise,"Putting Indians intellectually inferior must not even have been challenging and slow on the uptake for a famed person like Albert Einstein. He had been of the opinion that the Indians were rationally poorer.
This point was lately reported by India Today on the basis of the evidence of the journals containing the scientist’s views. Just the same observation was grasped when we read about our politicians who remained sometimes to be lesser qualified than the Chinese leaders who were plainly doctors and engineers.
Our politicians are usually not as much qualified but their minds run meticulously fast. They used to think ostensibly better than other countries’ political leaders.
It did not matter whether they possessed a degree of excellence or not for holding very important portfolios like the education or the HRD ministry.
What they more often perfectly enjoyed was their ability to completely grasp the public exact mood or temper. It is because of this very equability they succeed in motivating the common public to pander to the difficult posturing of Sheershasana, a form of Indian yoga.
Though this exercise is widely followed on one particular day, they were determined to make it a routine practice. When one comes into that specific posture, everything looks better, charming and brighter.
Upon settling on such pose, what is left to concentrate upon was securing a mantra for keeping ourselves comfortable for the rest of our lives. Besides, the urge to feel something relaxed after so many tensed feelings surmount us for a long duration.

Comedian's agony or hilarity!,"Comedian even searches comic content in own being. Agonizingly the famous stand-up comedian Bharti who surely adorns the status of modern-day Hardy in the world of laughter recently said in her interview of her mother’s desire who once thought of aborting her owing to some kind of financial situation. Nevertheless, she later decided against it. By revealing such secret she wanted to let her fans cry as they were used to laugh at her funny jokes.
If we take the situation differently, we could by all accounts say in a lighter vein that the size and weight she carries presently with her constitution might have possibly let her mother reject her baby for a split of the second. Her wider dimension likens her with the American comedian Hardy.
But how could she decide to detach her own baby of whatever size, colour or countenance? It would never be tolerable for an affectionate, caring mother to discard the newborn at any cost. And so she came into this world to laugh the mankind by her funny jokes. Now, her mother takes pride in her talent.
She admitted, “My mother wanted to abort me due to our financial condition, but she later decided. Today she is very proud of me.” It is a very cognisant or conscious effort and to select to stay, to fight, and love, no matter what happens, is love and only tender love. Her words remain compounded with hilarious contents. Is it not containing some kind of hilarity when she has made known to us of her mother’s ultimate vital choice?
It is impossible to go back once you come together with the one who is your mother. She is a manifestation of her mother and this reflection only reflects because of the whole connection. It is never void.",MEDIA
Women's representation in judiciary,"India stands far behind to Canada, Norway & Germany in women’s representation in the judiciary. It cannot be overlooked. It is even comparable with the statistics. It is really rare for two women to be SC judges presently.
When will India stand with countries like Norway and Germany in terms of the women judges’ representation at the topmost Court? According to a statistics, only seven women judges have reached the Supreme Court of India in 70 years of independent India.
In both the European countries, we find the number much higher than the Indian place. As many as seven judges were holding the top constitutional courts in Norway and Germany respectively. Canada is a country where 4 lady judges were rendering their services.
Quite the opposite, only two lady judges were sitting in the Supreme Court of India. This shows their number quite low with 8 percent. Norway holds 35 percent and Germany holds 43.8 percent representation in the top judiciary.
The judges’ numeral in the Supreme Court has risen to twenty-five following the inclusion of Justice Indu Malhotra. With her final addition in the list of the apex court judges, she directly becomes the second serving female judge of the country’s topmost Court of Justice. Thus, she and Justice R Banumathi are the two women judges currently.
Born in Bangalore in the year of 1956, the 62-year-old Justice Indu Malhotra is now the seventh woman judge of the Supreme Court after Justice Fatima Bibi, Justice Sujata V Manohar, Justice Ruma Pal, Justice Gyan Sudha Misra, Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai and Justice R Banumathi respectively.
The Supreme Court has plainly sanctioned post of thirty-one judges. Approved strength is still short of as many as six judges. It can be the subject of reasonable discussion. “Law is like a jealous mistress,” said an advocate who is elevated as a judge.",MEDIA
BSY's throw brought smile,"What Yeddyurappa finished was not done by Amit Shah. Nothing matters but the facts, said Black Edwards, American film-maker. The fact was that both the leading leaders, one party president and another CM candidate approached Lord Basveshwar’s to seek blessings in Bangalore. Both smiled and garlanded the decorated deity in their respective styles. The end result was something barbed leading them to presume strange experience.
On account of the deity’s height at a taller level, the BJP Chief Amit Shah mounted on the winch to place the wreath into the idol’s neck. But his direct throw was not proved effectual at the time. He threw very wreath from a certain distance but it did not fit exactly and fell down on the ground.
While on the other hand, BS Yeddyurappa’s fling remained accurate and well-timed. He was also present to garland the deity. They observed at garlanding of the idol but none appeared to have spoken any word.
The BJP chief would have disappointed but Yeddyurappa felt a whole stronger. His smile seemed to have indicated that feeling at the moment. It can’t be denied that the Congress and the BJP were frantically aiming at getting electoral triumph in the state. Both the parties were trying to gain victory in the assembly elections.
If that kind of success he secured was from the idol’s blessings, it became a matter of great satisfaction. The deity was worshipped by the Lingayat community. His smile seemed to have indicated that unique feeling at the moment. Who was proved luckier? Of course, it was BSY who got success in garlanding the idol after the blessings.It was also conceived as a good sign.
The politician must have been elated at the wonderful completion of wreathing the idol.Politicians do seek celestial blessings at the poll time.",MEDIA
Manjhi vents ire at Dalits' torture,"Dalits are at the centre of news these days. The politicians supporting their causes have become quite vocal at present for they know that their politics will shine behind their issues.
Sometimes, Mayawati speaks in their support in Uttar Pradesh while at another occasion Jiten Ram Manjhi raises the voice in support of the Dalits in Bihar. Both of them were up in arms against the ruling government either at the state or the centre over the Dalits’ harassment.
If one leader emphasises on disdain of the Ambedkar’s ideals in one state, the other leader resents strongly at the Dalits’ maltreatment in the name of prohibition in another adjacent state. Their voices were certainly held importance for they were determined to represent the causes of the down-trodden people.
Jiten Ram Manjhi, president of National Awami Party realised of Nitish Kumar, Bihar chief minister with a hint of discomfiture. He was criticising him for the pesky attitude towards the Dalits in the name of prohibition. With a jolt of his own displeasure, he warned the Bihar government not to torture the Dalits on the pretext of imposing liquor laws sternly.
He said, “More than 1 lakh people were presently in jail in the cases related to the liquor and majority of them were from the oppressed & poor Dalit community.”
Manjhi was too vocal to flay the different attitude in conducting the test of the boozers. The Dalits were put behind the bar while the administrative personalities were not being touched upon. He said that the bureaucrats and senior officials were consuming liquors freely despite being liquor law in place.
He even challenged the state govt for not conducting breath analyser test on ministers and other bureaucrats. If that was done the reality behind the prohibition would surely be exposed, he stressed upon.",MEDIA
Offending photo irks examinee,"An offending picture on the admit card jolts examinee just a day before the start of the examinations. She beseeched the authorities concerned to issue an admit card with her genuine photo. It was not the first case of its kind as a similar thing had emerged six months ago.
We used to grumble at the unexpected change in our photos on the voter’s identity card. But now on a different experience has come to pass with the applicant’s photo. An examinee of Bihar’s L N Mithila University has received her admit card bearing a woman’s picture in the lingerie.
This was quite embarrassing for the girl student appearing at the graduation level part-3 examinations. It was nothing but an unpleasant incident in the unending darkness. When she was grappling with the exam-time anxiety that kind of sudden alteration her admit card photo brought her in an intrinsically weak position.
Being a Home science (Honours) student of SMJ College at Khadejih in Madhubani, about 145 km away from Patna she lodged her formal complaint with the LNM University authorities pleading for a fresh admit card carrying her photo.
She was definitely shocked to see the offending picture. It
At the first instance, the college administration cleared that whatever irregularities were informed had not been done at its level as all the examination related issues were dealt by the university online.
There also came clearance from the university’s examination controller over the mistake though he in his orders directed to immediately change the picture with that of the examinee.
All the onus of that erroneous act was fallen on the agency which was roped in to issue admit card online. A written clarification was also sought from the agency concerned. This blunder was caused due to some grave lapse at a level.",MEDIA
"Arnab Goswami snubs Amit Malviya, says only he has the authority to announce election dates before EC","The Special Magistrate in the Indian news media, His Highness Sri Sri Arnab Goswami has expressed his displeasure on the tweet made by BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya for announcing the Karnataka’s election dates before it was officially announced by the EC and even by himself.
Arnab, the lone warrior,who handles the three pillars of Indian democracy (fourth one being put to rest since the ruling party formed the government) and convicts or acquits the accused even faster than the fast track courts, said that no one till date has dared to exceed him in the terms of knowledge, logic and latest updates.
But this swift update by Amit Malviya has tarnished Arnab’s superboy image in this fast technology world. When Arnab rebuked Amit, the latter deleted his tweet as a mark of respect to him. It is reported that Amit is the first one from BJP to get a scolding from the master.
As per the sources, Arnab knows well before hand the results of the elections and has also personally invited the prospective CM for swearing-in ceremony in his studio. He is just waiting for the formal announcement from EC so that the institution doesn’t feel inferior about its position in the the election process.",MEDIA
CBSE fails to hold paper leak,"What is the sanctity of the examinations if the questions were leaked. Those students who failed to write quite perfectly in the prior examination would be surely lucky enough in a re-examination. It was a big jolt for the examinees of the Central Board of Secondary Examination to re-appear at the re-examinations of the leaked papers. As they were taking pleasure in the feel of coming close to the examination, the news of conducting re-exam for Class XII Economics and Class X Mathematics papers has sent a shock wave among them.
One class 12th examinee said that she never hoped that the re-examination blow would hit just at the fag end of the examination days. She even kept apart from the subject book after March 26. But what was now more stressful was fear of the hard paper in the re-examination. Side by side, the class 10th examinees were more surprised with this development. There was a look of agony on their faces as they suddenly learnt of the certainty of re-examination.They had never been as disturbed as they now appeared.
No need to be depressed, some confident examinees think as they have been waiting for the Board’s clear clarification on re-examination. Neither the dates have been announced nor has clarification on all-India re-exam come so far by the Board.
This is not the first time when the CBSE exam papers were leaked. The Business studies question paper was leaked in the year of 2006. Further, there was news of question paper leak of Class XII science and mathematics in the year 2011. Even there was news of class XII accountancy question paper leak which the Board later denied. The parents and students claimed of the paper leak of class X social studies and class XII biology, according to the Times of India reports.",MEDIA
Mumbai man prays for single buttock in next birth to enable him to sit comfortably as fourth passenger on seat meant for three in local train,"While most people pray for wealth, health, job and relationship, Hiren Desai had something which even the Gods would be shocked to hear. The 30 year old business man from Mira Road, who is a regularly commutes by local train, asked for a single buttock in his next birth in his prayers. The reason for this unique request was to enable him to sit as the fourth passenger on a local train seat meant for three.

Leaving me with that uncomfortable fourth seat, where one of my buttock in left hanging without support. By the end of the day I am left with one sore butt. So my only prayer to the almighty is to give me just one buttock.”
Hiren’s request struck a chord with many other passengers who have been braving heavy rush in local trains for all these years. A city based cosmetic surgeon even offered to surgically remove one of Hiren’s buttock free of charge. “Why wait for the next birth. I will help this man in this life itself,” said the doctor.
After this news went viral on social media, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal assured that he’d set up a special committee to study and find out a solution to this problem. The committee will be headed by a retired IIT professor and a report is expected to to tabled in a year.

Woman who shifted from Delhi to Mumbai gains 5kgs in 5 days after not having to run due to eve teasing,"Mumbai: As compared to Mumbai and Kolkata where citizens sharply react to any incident of molestation or eve-teasing, such reactions are totally lacking or missing on the part of citizens of Delhi who have a vital role to play in preventing harassment to the women traveling in the city. A live example has come to our notice yesterday.
A woman, who had shifted from Delhi to Mumbai a few days back due to work commitments found out that she had gained 5 kgs in 5 days without even changing any dietary habits or any weather conditions.
Priyanka Ranaut, who works for an MNC shifted to Mumbai 5 days back. And in those 5 days, she never ran away due to any eve teaser harassing her, which was quite common in Delhi. But that scenario had created havoc in her personal life. Gaining 5 kgs in 5 days, she doesn’t where will it all stop.
If the same situation continues, she might gain a lot of weight which will be fatal to health. Many Gyms across the city have sent her their brochure of losing weight in a 30-day challenge or cashback offers.

'Just trying to fit into Delhi culture by brandishing gun' says ex-BSP MP's son over accusation,"Putting across his side of the story, ex- BSP MPs son Ashish Pandey admitted that he did brandish a gun as seen in the video but it was done to fit into the typical Delhi culture.
While elaborating on the ‘typical Delhi culture’, he said, “It’s a Delhi thing you know. When ‘tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai’ doesn’t work then you whip out your gun. It’s done as a scare tactic and no to actually shoot someone.”
“I am from Lucknow and even fights over there done with tehzeeb. I would be treated like an outcast if I tried that in Delhi. So I had to carry a gun and a baseball bat in my car to just to show that I am part of Delhi’s high society,” he added.
South Delhi businessman SK Khurana, though hesitant initially, did agree that these things are common in Delhi and media shouldn’t overreact. “Why is that Arnab behaving like a rabid mongrel over this issue. If he hadn’t brandished the weapon then it would have been a national crisis,” he said.
“I remember once I had an argument with a man after he cut me in traffic. We were talking like gentlemen and sorting the issue when some bystanders got restless and asked when are we going to start fighting. They were not happy with our politeness and wanted to hear some cuss words,” he recollected.
A senior bureaucrat, while commenting in the incident said that people coming from outside should respect the culture of Delhi. “Please liberally flaunt your political connections. Invest in a gun if you can afford it, especially the high society types. Carry a baseball bat in you car to start a road rage without provocation.

College withholds Mechanical engineer's degree for being in relationship with a girl,"Mumbai: 10 reasons to fall in love with mechanical engineers – do you know why smart girls prefer dating a mechanical engineer? Mechanical engineers are some of the best people to date with.

Lets come straight to the news. A college in Mumbai actually witholded aMechanical Engineer’s degree as he was dating a girl which is against the traditions of the Mechanical batch.
The news started with Sanil Malik a 4th-year student of Enimity Engineering college. He was dating a girl for the last 2 years, all these in hideouts as he was too embarrassed to tell this to his fellow batchmates. Mechanical Engineers are the Bhisma Pitamah of the current generation, where even talking to a girl is against traditions, parampara as they call it. His act was caught just 2 days before his convocation and he had to speak the truth then as his roaming with the girl was caught on CCTV cameras too. The college had never allowed any student from the mechanical batch to fall in love with a girl.
And Sanil was the latest victim of the tradition-face-off. Sanil has been told to spend one full year in the college living a single life without any relationship as part of the punishment.",MEDIA
Family of 6 have created 50 different Whatsapp groups to discuss specific problems they face,"Bengaluru: Gone are the days when Indian families sat at the breakfast table to discuss on anything without any specific agenda. Modern ‘Social media’ families believe in discussing the challenges they face through specific WhatsApp groups. No wonder WhatsApp claims users have spent 85 billion hours on its platform in last three months.
One such family is Rajeev Gowda’s family which has contributed massively to these billion hours of usage. A family of six has more than fifty plus active groups among themselves.

Mr. Gowda added, “In that state, how can my voice reach them. Yesterday I needed a towel when I was inside bathroom. Unlike shouting like an uncivilized person, I posted the request in three WhatsApp family group, then Ramu, our servant came over to handover the towel. Thanks to WhatsApp life is cool for all of us.”
Though Rajeev is the head of the family, Sunny is in-charge of social media department of the family. Sunny always encourages family members to create new groups with relevant people.
“Say for Rakhee related discussion like what should be length of the thread, what color Rakhee will look good in Instagram, what’s the latest fashion, me and Neeta have created a specific group to discuss this.

Criminal who tried to escape from police van said he was actually trying the KiKi challenge,"Mumbai: KiKi Challenge or InMyFeelings Challenge? Heard about it? If you’ve not been living under rocks for past few months, you know about this ongoing social media challenge we fondly know as KiKi challenge or InMyFeelings Challenge. On social media websites like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, videos with hashtags #KiKiChallenge or #InMyFeelingsChallenge are going viral. In the video, you can see some crazy people jumping out of their moving cars and dancing on Drake’s In My Feelings song while the car is moving. But some people are using it as an excuse after being caught in some act.
Shwetank Malik, a criminal the Mumbai police had an eye on finally got arrested yesterday.

Just like in all Bollywood movies, the handcuffs inside the van were pretty loose and Shwetank was able to free his body from that hold.
But it was when he jumped out of the van that some policemen took notice and arrested him again. This is when Shwetank narrated his interest in doing the KiKi challenge and wanting to excel at it. Mumbai policemen known for their generosity allowed him to make a small video of his kiki challenge and upload it on Facebook before taking him to jail.",SOCIALMEDIA

Restaurants in Mumbai stay closed for 2 hours as Instagram goes down,"Young people around the world are highly addicted to Instagram and in India, the number is rising like anything. While the photo-based platform got points for self-expression and self-identity, it was also associated with high levels of anxiety, depression, bullying, and FOMO, or the “fear of missing out.” People take great pleasure in posting pics on Instagram and actually forget the main purpose of the activity they have come to do at a place, e.g eating food. Restaurants in Metros like Mumbai are flooded by so-called food bloggers, who order the most exotic food, take pics and go out of the restaurant without having even a single bite.
Shwetank Srivastava is one such Instagram addict, who visits exotic restaurants, food outlets, street food corners and different cities for the love of food pics. He tries to take pictures from all possible angles, sometimes even bothering the customers sitting on a different table. He usually spends 30-40 mins to click good pictures of his food and then goes out after paying the bill. The good thing for the restaurants is that they can serve the same platter to some other customer as Shwetank doesn’t even bother touching the food.
This is just one story out of many thousands in Mumbai. Restaurants are so happy with the Instagram customers that they have started offering them discounts. Yesterday though was a bad day for business as Instagram went down for 2 hours and it was no point for the restaurant owners to keep their outlets open as they knew 90 % of their customers are Instagram users and they come for food pics. Regular customers have stopped going to restaurants as frequently as they used to go in the past. Even Instagram has started asking for royalty from the restaurant for every customer they get.",SOCIALMEDIA
Five guys in project complaining they have no time to die come forward to be mentor of new intern girl,"Bengaluru: It was becoming increasingly difficult for project manager Lalit Tiwari to manage some of the most experienced engineers in his team. Any work you assign to them however small it is, they will complain they are over loaded and have no bandwidth to take up anything more.
Lalit being a senior professional used his ‘brahmastra’, that is ‘men will be men’ test to know how loaded some of those engineers are. He sent out one email asking who all are free to be mentor for the new intern girl Pooja who has joined us last week. In a record 0.3 millisecond he got response from five who always complained to him saying they do not have time to die.
“I am glad to know my team members read my email. If mail is ‘interesting’ like this one, they reply quickly too,” said Lalit while speaking to us.
Lalit who is planning to use the same email subject for next one month so that team members read and respond to him on the tasks assigned to them said, “Always thought my team members are only quick to react when I move near their cubicles. They will be fully engrossed in surfing social media pages or chatting on FB messenger, they will switch their active window to some ‘complier’ screen in lightning fast mode to show me they are working.”
The five techies have asked Lalit to be fair and choose the one with ‘fastest finger fast’ means who sent the email first, that should be checked by IT admin by going through mail server logs timestamp. In the meantime, Pooja has conveyed to Lalit, she does not need a mentor. She has gone through documents available on the project webpage which are so clear, no need of any mentorship. She is ready to own some tasks.
These five techies are checking who is uploading such nice documents to project page to teach him a ‘proper’ lesson.",SOCIALMEDIA
"Ola driver drives his car into the lift to reach the exact pick up location, which was on 7th floor of a multi-storey building","Think twice before pinning your pick up location next time while using Ola App. As an Ola driver drove his cab on to the 7th floor to pick up his customer to get a 5-star rating in return.
Manoj, a resident of Goregaon and frequent ola cab user, was shocked to see this amount of customer care from his cab driver, Pradeep. On Thursday, Manoj booked a cab to go to his office, after waiting for 2 mins he noticed someone rang his house bell.
It was Pradeep who was panicking and sweating like anything. Pradeep’s Wagon R got stuck in the building lift. Totally scared, Manoj got so frightened that he even forgot to update his facebook status ‘On the way to Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport’.
Faking News reporter spoke to Manoj the very next day to understand the incident better. Manoj said, “I booked an Ola for Airport on Thursday. Almost after 5 minutes I got a call from this Pradeep asking “where are you sir?”. I said I live on the 7th floor of this building. You just come to pinned location, and give me a missed call and I’ll come down. After 2 minutes, I heard people shouting and car horns outside my gate. When the door bell rang my wife Kuntal opened the door and the scene was abominable. Pradeep was right outside my gate to pick me up. He didn’t let me step on floor and lifted me to his car.”
Similar incident happened in Vashi last year when a cab driver Salman (name changed for safety) drove on  footpath, since the pick up location showed footpath of the palm beach road. Driver Salman wasn’t even apologetic about his act and said “Sir ye to mera roz ka hai” to the traffic policeman who asked him to pay penalty.
Manoj’s driver, Pradeep has a completely different view point. Pradeep said “Ye Sahaab log bada mach-mach karta hai. Pick up location pe na aao to 3 star dete hai pick up location pe aao toh bhi 3 star dete hai. (This Sahab people are never happy, If you don’t reach exact pick-up location they give you poor rating, and if you reach their exact pick-up location still they give you poor rating. I want 5-star, my son loves it).”
Incident became popular on social media too and one of the users said “Amazon should hire people from Ola as their delivery boys reach the exact location”. Another user quoted a news about the incident and said “No one should take their job so seriously”.",SOCIALMEDIA
Guy using Snapchat on 2G nominated for CID Gallantry Award,"Monday was an amazing day for Mumbai-based Suyash Mehra, when he was nominated for CID Gallantry Award by ACP Pradyuman and his team. What Suyash has done is no small feat. It requires great courage and determination. Suyash has been nominated for this award because he had the audacity to operate and use Snapchat.. wait for it.. while he was on 2G.
Yes, we gasped at the news too. In today’s world when even thinking of opening Snapchat for anything less than 4G requires valor, Suyash has done the same while being on 2G.
We got hold of Suyash and he said, “I use Vodafone 4G and I pay Rs. 499 for it. No, I actually I use Vodafone 2G at the price of 4G because most of the time the network is at 2G. Wasn’t this the 2G scam that was in news recently?”
After his misconception was cleared by our reporter, Suyash continued, “Anyway, so I am on Snapchat since the last 4 years. I have a score of more than 100,000. I usually operate Snapchat at night when the network is better. But that night (the night when he achieved the feat), I was talking to this girl that I had met on Tinder. We talked on Whatsapp, Tinder, Snapchat, Facebook, everywhere. After one month of talking daily for 14 hours, she had finally agreed to take our relationship ahead. I was eating dinner when she sent me a text on Snapchat asking ‘Want nudes?’ I ate my last bite of food and ran towards faster than The Flash. I replied with a ‘yes’ and began waiting.”
“But at that exact moment, I suddenly became the most famous guy on earth. The whole world started calling me and sending me messages for trivial reasons. Even my previous crushes that had ignored me my whole life messaged me on Facebook. It was a tough choice for me to not reply. Snapchat was the only priority at that moment. I cut many calls, ignored messages, even blocked people, as the network was 2G and other things were blocking the net bandwidth. I only wanted to use Snapchat. So I uninstalled every application on my phone except Snapchat. And then she sent a pic. It took me exactly 25 minutes to load the snap, but it was worth it,” he smiled.
No doubt, Suyash has done something that we don’t even think of doing. As the quote rightly says “Fortune favors the brave”; this bravery has enabled Suyash to achieve a happy ending.",SOCIALMEDIA
Restaurant launches menu of Instagram worthy food,"New Delhi: In a not-so-unexpected development, an upmarket restaurant in South Delhi has launched a separate menu of food that one can order only for the purpose of taking pictures to post on Instagram. The food that comes is not real and is charged on per minute basis.
Faking News sent its team for further investigations.
Said Balwinder Bhalla, the owner of ‘Eat Before You Die’ restaurant in Greater Kailash II, “Most people spend 30-40 minutes clicking pictures of food before eating it. Yesterday we had a couple who just ordered hot chocolate with some whipped cream. First they clicked the picture of the hot chocolate. Then the girl held at cup in various positions and the boy clicked her picture with it. Then the boy did the same and the girl clicked his pictures. After that they took multiple selfies with the cup. The hot chocolate became cold by that time. Finally after almost 45 minutes when they were about to take their first sip, a little bit of whipped cream got stuck on the girl’s nose. They found it so funny that they took many pictures of that by both zooming in and out. After that all of us thought that they shall finally drink the damn hot chocolate but that didn’t happen!! They took one sip, made a face and left!”
Balwinder paused to take a breath. He then continued.
“I have had ten times more customers complain to me about the look of the food than the taste!! Finally I decided to create a separate menu of food items that look beautiful but are made up of plastic that one can’t eat. And they are bringing me more revenue than real food! I charge INR 100 per minute for our signature Tiramisu cake’s ceramic replica and yet it is always sold out. It never comes back to the shelf and is always moving from one table to another! I am telling you and please mark my words – this is the future of restaurant business!!”
Balwinder started shaking violently. Our reporter thought that he had a stroke but his felt more compelled to do his duty as journalist than a good human being and didn’t offer to take him to the hospital.
Faking News caught up with Tanuj Khosla, its in-house expert on such issues. “Balwinder’s idea is revolutionary,” said Tanuj while adding red chilli pickle to his mango lassi. “These days it a cardinal sin to eat anything without informing your friends and family about it on Instagram. Imagine how sad and lost you would feel if your sibling or girlfriend had lunch and you had no idea what they ate. Balwinder is trying to solve a very big social problem – now you can let the world know what you ate without ACTUALLY eating it!! This shall save people both calories and money. I think Balwinder should be awarded a Noble prize for such a noble initiative.”",SOCIALMEDIA
Girl sleeping all day calls herself insomniac for being awake at night,"A Delhi girl, Priya, in an attempt to sound cool on social media, has vowed to keep herself awake every night and update her Facebook wall, suggesting her friends that she cannot sleep at night.
By repeatedly calling herself an ‘insomniac’ in several Facebook posts and comments, she hinted that she finds it difficult to sleep at night. Further investigations into the matter revealed that although Priya keeps awake all night, she sleeps all day, which doesn’t amount to insomnia.
Priya’s parents took her to a psychologist, Dr. Singh, to identify the cause of her sleeplessness at night. Dr. Singh, after examining her, concluded that her condition is serious as she is not suffering from insomnia but Attention-seeking Disorder.
In a research conducted earlier this year, it was found that people who call themselves “insomniac” on social media are attention-seekers of the highest level, followed by those who call themselves “ugly” and repeatedly state that they are single. Dr. Singh, in her report, has also warned that Priya has reached the last stage of attention-seeking.
Our reporters visited Priya’s home during the day and spotted her sleeping. Her parents, explaining how she’s crazy for ‘likes’ and ‘comments’ on Facebook, said, “Priya thrives on air, water, food and attention. She only wakes up after remaining members of the family sleep. After waking up at night, she logs in to Facebook and updates statuses like ‘OMG I just can’t sleep’, ‘Sleep is for the weak’, ‘Error 404, sleep not found’, etc.”
We visited Priya again during the night to see her in action. She was texting people in her friends list, explaining them how she can’t sleep at night. After speaking to us and explaining her condition, she cribbed, “I wasted my five minutes talking to you. Many of my friends must have thought that I took a nap as I was inactive during those five minutes. Now, I’ll have to text them to tell that my Internet was down— just to reinstate their faith in my insomnia.”",SOCIALMEDIA

Similar was the case this year when the annual competition was held in Mumbai. This year’s competition was won by 52-year old Mumbai based Ramesh Mishra, with him creating a new record of sending 45 Good Morning messages in one minute.
We interviewed Mr. Mishra after his win and here’s what a delighted Ramesh had to say. “I am very thankful to my kids and all my relatives because of whom this win has been possible. They have been the elements of my net practice for today’s final match. I was preparing for this competition for the last 6 months. I used to send Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Good Evening and Good Night messages to each of the 37 people in my contact list, each day. Then one day I sent Suraj, my son, a Whatsapp forward that showed how to increase height to 6 feet by eating home-made spices,” said Mr. Mishra
“He identified the news was fake and that how dedicated I was for the competition. He then took the practice to the next level. Each day, I was made to create and forward three news that were fake. I started mastering the art, in fact one day our neighbor Mr. Sharma was dancing on our terrace wearing polka dot underwear, because my fake forward told him to do so if he wanted to turn his Whatsapp to Blue Whatsapp,” he added.
“If you had asked me 6 months ago that whether I could send 45 messages in one minute, I would have laughed at you and sent you a home-made recipe to cure mental illness, on Whatsapp. It is because of my sheer dedication, practice and the support of my family members as well as some relatives (and ex-relatives; some broke the relation due to overload of messages and fake news) that I have been able to win this competition. I hope to defend the title successfully next year and also plan to take part in the Hike competition later next year. I am hoping it would be easy as only 13 out of the total 15 users of Hike are taking part in it,” Mr. Mishra concluded.
We congratulate Mr. Mishra on his stupendous win and wish him all the best for further competitions.",SOCIALMEDIA
Man breaks record after inviting 500 people on Hike says the number is more than the people he invited on his wedding ,"Hike Messenger is recently in news again for its bizarre yet unique strategy that it has applied to gain more users. Hike now enables their users to get a certain amount of cash, which will be stored in what they are calling it as Hike Wallet.
The basic process is as follows – If you use Hike and you invite anyone on it, you get cash rewards. The rewards go up to Rs. 10,000. Following this, Rajdeep Sharma, a Delhi resident, started inviting as many people on Hike as he can. He didn’t stop until the count reached till 500, which is more than double the number of people he had invited on his wedding.
Rajdeep isn’t available on phone or on Whatsapp. So we had to contact him through Hike for the interview. We interviewed him at his home and here’s what he said, “I am totally in love with this new ‘Pay users for inviting others’ strategy that Hike has adopted. I have accumulated Rs. 15,000 in my Hike wallet till now. I am an engineer by profession working in an IT company and I have been put on bench since the last 6 months. I didn’t know what to do during my free office hours so I used to attend the weddings happening in the marriage hall next to our office. Just to kill time and to justify all the free food I ate there, I used to join the bride’s side in inviting and welcoming guests. This was my daily routine for 6 months. Then one day I got a message from a friend saying that I’ll get money if I invite people on Hike.”
“I had gotten very accustomed to inviting people but now I was to get money for that. Earlier, I got only food.” He further adds “So I took it as a challenge to invite as many people as I can. And to just to let you know I had invited around 200 people on my own wedding. But just 2 days ago, my Hike invitation count went up to 500.” When asked how he’s going to utilize the amount in his Hike wallet, he said “At present there are not many things you can shop using Hike money, like you can on PayTM. As of now, I can only do recharges and order like 2-3 things using Hike wallet. But soon Hike is going to add more options and by the time it does, I plan to invite a whole city on Hike,” he added.
We like the enthusiasm and spirit of Rajdeep and we wish him all the best on this task. So if you receive a message on your phone asking you to join Hike, you now know who it may be!",SOCIALMEDIA
Dad teaches kid to share food with others kid shares food on Instagram ,"Any parent in the world wants their kid to learn the importance of sharing. They often teach their kid that sharing is caring.
However, sometimes this can backfire and lead to something else, like it happened with Colaba resident Sanjay Singhania. Sanjay, CEO of a $50 million company, thought that teaching his son Aryan to share food with others will make him kind and humble. But since today’s kids are technologically more advanced, Aryan took the interpretation of his father’s teaching, as sharing food with others, but on Instagram.
We got hold of Sanjay in his 3500 square feet Colaba home and here’s what he said, “I have done everything for my kid that any parent on this earth would do. Aryan was born in Kokilaben Hospital. When we brought him home, we built a custom-made Armani cradle for him. We bought clothes for him from Zara and Van Heusen. When he turned 10, I gave him his first iPhone. But what did I know that providing him this plethora of facilities and privileges would turn him into a mechanical and digital robot. He has become so immersed in these gadgets and social media that he is online for 18 hours a day. And mind you, he’s just 12. Last night, I told him to always be humble and helping towards others and to share his food with others.”
“Today morning, he came running to me saying he shared his food with 3500 people. At first I was very happy that my son is learning how to be a good human being, but when I realised that by 3500 people, he meant his Instagram followers, I facepalmed myself. Imagine a 12 year old kid having 3500 followers. When I was a kid, we didn’t even have that many people in our village. Last week, he didn’t show me his report card, but rather tagged me on the photo of report card on Facebook.  The other day he told his maternal uncle to PayTM him the money rather than handing it out as shagun; and now today, this Instagram thing. The day is not far when he will not leave the room and talk to us just via Skype,” he added.
Meanwhile, Sanjay got a Skype call from his kid Aryan asking Sanjay to show his feet so that he can take his blessing as it was his exam the next day. Sanjay furiously left the hall and marched towards Aryan’s room so we had to end the interview.",SOCIALMEDIA
YouTuber's kid says 'Subscribe' as his first word instead of mom or dad,"It was an unbelievable day for YouTuber / Stand-up comedian Manan Fin, when his 2-year old kid, just uttered his first word. And why is this incident news worthy? Because the first word of his kid was not mom; not dad, but the word Subscribe!
However bizarre this may sound, but it is true. We interviewed Manan and here’s what an ecstatic Manan said, “Before we begin this interview, have you all subscribed to my channel?” Since no one had, he made everyone subscribe to his channel and then continued with the interview.
“I have been on YouTube for almost 8 years now. Back then when no one had the idea of what YouTube is, I started posting random videos. And then when YouTube boom happened, my videos gained traction. My most viewed video from that time was me falling from the roof of my house. The second most viewed video was me getting kicked in the nuts by a chimpanzee in a zoo that I had visited in Chicago. It was only after the second video getting famous that I realized that I have a natural trait of making people laugh. I got to know this from the comments, which mostly read ‘LOL’. ‘ROFL’ and ‘You deserve this’.”
“Also, I am an engineer. So, at first I had obviously decided to go for my MBA, but in 2014 these start-up and stand-up things were talk of the town so I decided to go for stand-up. I got married soon and had a baby. My wife used to bring our kid to all my shows and video edits. At the end of every show/video, I used to tell the audience and viewers to subscribe to my channel. I was so used to saying subscribe that I started making random people, autowaalas, sabjiwalas and even those relatives whom I hadn’t spoken in decades, subscribe to my channel. Although, I faced resistance from some of them in a verbal as well as physical form, but it increased my subscriber base so it was worth it,” he added.
“And then 2 days ago, my wife noticed that our kid is trying to say something. I left my shoot midway and came home running. Just when I entered room, my kid uttered Subscribe!” says a teary eyed Manan. “I was so so happy. I always wanted that my kid should become a YouTuber/ Stand-up comedian, and I am very happy that he has started his preparations this soon.”
Truly amazing, isn’t it? We are very happy for Manan Fin and if you haven’t subscribed to his channel, subscribe today! (He promised us that if we say this, he won’t show us more of his videos during the interview).",SOCIALMEDIA
Instagram down due to maintenance food bloggers lose employment ,"Friday was a normal day for food bloggers until Instagram, the popular social media platform that allows users to eat food only after uploading a picture of the delicacy, was down for five hours due to maintenance.
Panic quickly spread across the food bloggers’ community as they were rendered jobless and had to munch on food without uploading its pictures.
Owing to the non-functioning of Instagram, many food bloggers remained adamant and did not eat food until the portal resumed operations. Restauranteurs had a slack period as Instagram went down. At many places, customers walked into the restaurant but didn’t order food, resulting in loss for the management.
The customers also used free WiFi available in the restaurants to check if Instagram had started working so they could resume posting food pictures. “They starved to death on the table but did not order food because the portal was down. We even tried tempting them by bringing lip-smacking food near their face, but to no avail,” said a café owner in Delhi.
Further investigations revealed that it was not just the food blogging industry that was hit by the shutdown. In several independent incidents, people identifying themselves as fashion bloggers and models by using #FashionBlogger under all their selfies were also forced to stop their artwork. “My followers didn’t get to know what I was wearing on Friday. I wonder what they would have worn without my proper guidance,” said a self-claimed fashion blogger from South Delhi.
Technicians at Instagram had a field day as the portal crashed after a girl posted her selfie with 98 hashtags under it. On our visit to the Instagram headquarters, an aggrieved technician said, “A supposed model from South Delhi posted multiple hashtags under one selfie, resulting in the crashing of our website. We have upgraded our systems, especially for girls from South Delhi and South Bombay, so the fiasco doesn’t repeat.”",SOCIALMEDIA
Survey says 90% youngsters use festivals as an excuse to message their crushes and Exes,"A survey conducted by the students of California University and Gopalchand Deemed University suggests that a majority of youngsters now use festival greetings as an excuse either to break the ice or re-initiate talks with their crushes and exes respectively.
India is a land of festivals, and that’s one of the reasons India has the ideology of Vasudev Kutumbakam, because relatives keep coming to stay together, making the whole world, one home.
These festivals not only bring relatives, but also bring smiles on people’s face for various reasons. People wait for their special festival whole year. Time has changed now people wait for festivals for their personal reasons too. After shopkeepers and shopping websites, if there is anyone who wait eagerly for these festivals- it’s the people who want to reconnect with their Exes.
A recent survey conducted after Diwali confirms that people wait for festivals in order to talk to their crushes and exes. Raghu Chandra (changed name) of Bengaluru said, “Me and my girlfriend were not on talking terms since 3 months, but as Diwali came I sent her a Diwali forward and she responded with the same. We laughed it out and start talking again! All thanks to Diwali.”
Manoj Malhotra of Delhi too confirmed this, He said, “I am an engineer and I am in love with my colleague, Anshita (name changed) since many years. Though never mustered up the courage to tell her. She never replies to engineers so only way I can get her reply is by wishing her on Diwali, New Year, Holi, her birthday or getting wished by her on my birthday.”
“Manoj’s desperation to get a reply from Anshita is so high that he once mistakenly wished her Happy Muhrram after which she block Manoj on WhatsApp,” told his friend Ashwin.
It’s surprising that in today’s world of artificial intelligence people still want replies from human beings. But if that is how it is then we must show our gratitude for being part of such a beautiful culture of India that allows us to message our near and dear ones every other day.",SOCIALMEDIA
Man angry as nobody targets him on social media using his online private data,"Mumbai: Local man has become angry and frustrated as he is ignored on social media by all political parties and ad companies. Kuldip Patel, 29, told our reporter with anger, “I have put everything personal  on my Facebook account. It’s all public. I have been waiting to get targeted by any political party and no political party is targeting me. It’s just so bad”.
Kuldip, a software person, continued, “We all know about Facebook Cambridge analytica scandal. It has been months since it has been in public.

I have been waiting to get some targeted news feed in my Facebook feed.”
Frustrated local resident added, “A friend of mine suggested to put everything about me on Facebook account. I did so. I even added screenshots of my google search terms on my Facebook. I have done same thing on Twitter also”.
But all political parties from left and right spectrum have just ignored me. I feel so less as I am getting no ads from all other online retailers of food, cloths, hotels too.”
Almost tearful Kuldip asked our reporter, “Why is this happening to me?  I am almost like a ghost for everyone online even though I have my all data publicly available online. I have been waiting for being targeted by Congress, BJP, flipcart, Amazon,  Myntra, Democratic Party, republican party, Labour Party and so many others. All just ignored me.”

Social media don't correct grammar,"What was Rajat Anand before Rishi Kapoor? The relation between them is that of fan and actor. If he was an advocate, another is a celebrity. His mistake was that he pointed at the actor’s performance while the veteran actor indicated his poor linguistic skills.
With eyes of innocence and bewildering mindset, both reacted at each other. There was no hatred between their reactions. If a lawyer writes something admirable for the actor’s adept performance in the film Mulk, the veteran actor condemns him for the poor linguistic skills.
This was the simple story that began and ended in abomination. Social media like Facebook and Twitter are genuinely not considered to be apt sites for upgrading our skills in the English language. A hasty decision was never good.
These platforms are used to be expanding the reach of the users’ written words in whatever form they are putting. These platforms are barely focussing on the sense and soul of the typed words. If the fan’s language was incomprehensible, the actor’s sentence was also below the mark.
Those social sites do obviously not bother about the grammatical structure of the sentence instantly. But the refined actor appeared to have read between the lines and sought the attention of the particular fan towards his poor English grammar, spelling and lingo.
He even went on saying that he did not grasp the expressed words. He even suggested the fan to brush up his linguistic dexterity. Instead of being excited about appreciations and showing gratitude to the fan the elderly actor turned the subject towards a different angle.
The actor did not wholly think of appreciating his ardent fan’s sincere praises for the performance in the film. That critical disapproval made the famed actor bear the Twitter users’ rage to a larger extent.",SOCIALMEDIA
Guy divorces his wife for not wishing on his birthday and later finds out that she wished him on Facebook,"Ramesh is an IT specialist at an MNC in Hyderabad. He is married to Swapna from the same company two years back.
Ramesh is not a big Social Media guy and used to wish his wife with his own words out of his mouth on her birthdays and was expecting the same from her. On the other hand Swapna who was more into social media and loved her husband as much as he did, habitually wished him on Facebook and forgot to wish him directly.
This built up conflicts between them and lead to a divorce. Only after their divorce, Ramesh came to see her posts on Facebook saying how much she loves him and decides to keep himself updated from now.
However reports suggest that this is not the first time swapna wished someone on Facebook. Last Mothers day she expressed love for her mom on a facebook post and unfortunately her mom doesnt have an account.
Keeping in mind all the misunderstandings the Government suggests people to express their ‘Mann ki Baat’ directly rather than through Social Media.",SOCIALMEDIA
"Chief of everyone’s secrets, Mark Zuckerberg updated status to 'Feeling Hopeful' after receiving a Close letter","After a week of Facebook and Cambridge Analytics fiasco, suddenly Mark Zuckerberg changed his status from # guilty to # feeling hopeful and energetic. A wave of happiness spread across FB offices except for his University topper friends and Google. They are busy in guessing the reason behind his happiness. Upon being asked by FakingNews reporter about their sadness, in one voice, they said we are reacting as per common phenomena of human behavior.
This change left all news reporters and media houses perplexed including Arnab Goswami. Soon after this most important breaking news, Arnab clarified that “He neither has removed his adjective filled allegations nor stopped flash of tweeter feeds -# Brobdingnagian data leak of photos and videos # Aperture of all time
Arnab sadly mentioned that – He is getting more queries asking about the meaning of his written words than likes, shares and tweet reactions to his post. Utilizing this platform, he advised to viewers- Not to search the meaning of words as those are yet to be published in the Oxford dictionary
While on the other side, Mark is jumping in the excitement to be the first ever receiver of a Close letter.
A close friend of Mark, on the condition of spreading his name like never before, agreed to speak to our reporter – He said “Mark is happy because of this close letter which has an idea which he thinks will change his life”
Without even insisting- His friend said that this letter has come from Dinesh Lal – Bihar. The moment news channels heard the source location – Bihar, unanimously, Raveesh Kumar’s name got fixed for reporting. MDTV head proudly said that- “Biswas rakhiye, humare Raveesh ka Bihar database Aadharcard ke database se Jayda bda hai”
In no time, Raveesh kumar took out his diary and started calling all (113) Dinesh Lal listed in his diary. It had all Dinesh Lal’s records except the one who was born last month. Suddenly, he stopped at 50th number and shouted “Yhi hai close letter wala Dineshwaaa”. Upon asking how is he so confident about him? He replied JiO ke free zamane me Idea ka caller tune lagane wala aur koi nhi Idea dene wala hi hai……
Raveesh took the shortest route and appeared in front of Dinesh Lal. Other reporters looked inquisitive (High fundoo word for high profile log), surprised (Village people), jealous (relatives and his friends), and proud (Fatherof Dinesh). Raveesh asked in voice of anger and surprise- Dineshwa aisa ka likh ke band letter me bhej dis re?
Dinesh responded in confident voice displaying his true inspiration from his mobile network and said- “Raveesh bhaiya – Humara letter band zarur tha lekin idea bilkul khula diye hain. Share kar dijiyega sara data Mark bhai- Kitab aur Chehre khule hi hone chahiye”
The social media behemoths agreed to consider Dinesh Lal’s idea to leak all data confirmed by Board of directors FB. Mark again updated his status with photo – # Ganga Maiya ki kasam sb leak kar denge and updated his selfie with Dinesh in suit (no t-shirt) on FB – displaying gratitude Mark added – Thank you Dinesh bhai location Tejpur, Bihar.",SOCIALMEDIA

"Girl answering on Quora for ""height of Indian hypocrisy"", turned out to be a big hypocrite","Rita is working in TCS. Like lakhs others, she is on bench for last 2 years and has no work to do. She passes most of her time on internet using Facebook, Quora, Instagram and thousands more. One day she decided to write on quora so that she does not completely forget typing (Rita has no boyfriend or friends). She answered to the most popular question “height of Indian hypocrisy”, writing various comments about people judging girls on the basis of the clothes, drinking habits. Her answer received 380 views and 25 up-votes and she was on the top of the world, as she felt like being proposed by those 25.
But what she forgot was that her colleagues are as workless as her. They saw her answer and got jealous, because their answer never even crossed 100 views. One of her colleague (on bench for 3.5 years) decided to do some research on Rita and what he found out was too shocking.
Rita had never ever thought that this answer will change her entire life. She used qoura to write that answer but forget about her past. On facebook she called a girl “slut” because she was on a bikini photoshoot. She did not stop here, once told her parents about how her cousin has a boyfriend and she goes to party with her (her cousin also works in TCS Gurgaon and actually has work to do). All her colleagues posted about her in the comments section, and the whole India gathered there to bash her down , as if they were waiting for something like this to happen (which could answer the second most popular question on Quora, “what is the problem with Indians”). She turned out to be a big hypocrite and those flooding comments forced Quora  to blacklist her account eventually.
She is now trying to find a real job.",SOCIALMEDIA
Kerala's wink girl at football match,"Earlier, the 28-second film clip of Priya Prakash Varrier, an 18-year-old student of the famed Vimala College of Thrissur in Kerala state turned mania of one and all. Now she remained gripped by the presence of Sachin Tendulkar during the Super Indian League football match between Chennaiyin FC and Kerala Blasters. She was present along with her Oru Adaar Love co-star Roshan Abdul Rauf. Seating just right behind the Indian cricketer, she, in her posted picture on Twitter, sent fans jolly once again. Without waiting for anything from him, she kept on gazing at him.
This wink girl made the eyes’ movement equal to bodily dance. Her style made viewers excited as well as uneasy. There was a definite chemistry between her and co-star. They were least aware of the impending tension of what would take place after that. She winked, held her gaze and smiled slightly. Her eyes were looking at Sachin Tendulkar in yellow T-shirt and jacket. There was ample amount of glint in her eyes, and the viewers could not help wondering for the hundredth time if that cute glance was meant for flirtatious.
She had accepted that the particular classical dance helped her make winks invariance. There was a big objection to her wink and mischievous smile when the video dominated the social media. This position appeared to have filled the young students’ brains with the cutest idea of attaining mastery over flirting conduct rather than learning the good method of stares.
The wink and other facial expression gave an immoral look, several thoughts so. Those persons who opposed unacceptable part in the movie had their particular points which could not be wholly rejected. The video gathered insignificant backing merely because of its imbalanced judiciousness, as a lot of dissenters ranted. The school dress portrayal was also not appreciated.",SOCIALMEDIA

Link your Aadhaar to Facebook for receiving justice on Facebook,"Vishy Kumar, an ultra modern and ultra metrosexual man has created a furore by posting on Facebook that a woman fooled him on the pretext of a prospective affair which has resulted into him suffering from depression.
He wrote in the post ” Preeti met me in my college, she was very sweet and friendly – which resulted into a quick bond between us. Soon she started giving me signs that she was interested – When we shook our hands, she held onto my hand for 2 extra seconds than normal human beings do, she like my every Facebook, Instagram pictures, posts. She even went on to comment “Awww, chho cute” when I posted a picture of mine where I photoshopped myself along with Anushka Sharma in Europe. I was not sure of her love for me, but it just struck me suddenly when she started tagging me in many of Meme’s on Facebook, Instagram etc. When I pinged her on Whatsapp to profess my love, she rejected me by sending me a Meme with only Arvind Kejriwal in it. I realized then and there she was a scam, she never loved me, for the last 2 hours I am crying like hell – I feel like I am depressed.”
His heart wrenching story was soon picked up by many respected Social Media Websites who earn their bread and butter by publishing stories of such dsitressed and depressed people. Due to the unrelenting media coverage, Vishy’s plea was heard by the President of the ‘Frustrated One Sided Lovers Associaton’s President Pushma Singh Swaraj. Pushma requested the President of India to immediately interevene in this matter and asked for immediate redressal.
But before it could be even put in court of justice, a few trained and professional stalkers were able to find the Preeti as mentioned in the post and started an attack on Preeti. Preeti was tagged in hundreds of Meme’s and many wrote ‘Get Well Soon Preeti’ on her Facebook account. Preeti did not heed to such targetted attacks on her Facebook, but all hell broke lose when many of her Instagram followers started unfollowing. Fearing a further loss of Instagram followers which she had gained over 2 years, Preeti decided to apologize to Vishy and decided to enter into an ‘Trial Free’ period of dating.
Facebook helped Vishy get justice back within a few days, hence he has decided to appeal to the President of India. By the time of publishing, there was no response from the President’s office over this issue, while an automated reply was received from Prime Minster’s Office stating that ‘Yes it is possible, you need to link your Aadhaar number first’.",SOCIALMEDIA
Bandra girl gets teaching offer from Oxford University after she reads out Shashi Tharoor's tweet without any fumble,"Mumbai. Taking the advantage of her pseudo English accent, which is often made fun of by people in her proximity, a girl from Bandra has got an offer for teaching the students of Masters in English Programme of the Oxford University.
The would be tutor’s name is Jahanvi Kapoor who got this offer under her belt when she read out the most farragous tweet of the season very carefully, keeping the goof-ups aside.
The tweet was made by none other than Shashi Tharoor who keeps arsenal of words with him to win any argument.
Shashi has kept his audience busy in rolling its eyeballs over dictionary for his every tweet. Some words have their meaning assigned to them, while for others, the context decides their fate.
Jahanvi has been following Tharoor on twitter since last one year which has helped her to increase vocabulary significantly.
She spoke to our reporter and said, ” Whenever Shashi uncle tweeted something, I used to get confused. I had to refer dictionary to get its meaning. Reading his tweets over the period and using the dictionary every damn time made me reach to a level where I could understand even German and French words. I have the image of most sophisticated girl in our gang. Earlier I was afraid if someone comes and asks me about the meaning of Shashi Tharoor’s tweet, then how would I explain it to him. Now I’m confident enough to erode away common man’s confusion which he gets after reading his tweets.”
How the Oxford University offered her the tutor’s job is another sweet story.
Director of the University told us,” Tharoor has given us the taste of our own medicin. Our team was in Mumbai to make a thesis on his tweets and articles. Some failed in reading, some in speaking and few completely lost it. The project was going out of our hands. One night we were roaming near Bandstand when we overheard a girl reading Tharoor’s tweet immaculately. That was completely mesmerising. We made her an on the spot offer to her to come to our university and teach our students to how to interpret and understand the toughest thing in the world of twitter. ”
Now Jahanvi has applied for UK visa and will be joining the university soon.",SOCIALMEDIA
"Jack Dorsey, twitter CEO, joins BJP","In a shocking turn of events, Jack Dorsey, twitter CEO, joins BJP. This is a historic achievement by any political party ever in the rich Indian political history.
This is the first major political coup landed by an Indian political party with respect to foreign acquisitions. The days when foreign companies acquired Indian companies are gone. We are now acquiring foreign CEOs and turning their companies Indian through the acquisition. This adds a new twist to Make in India moment.
As a tacit confirmation of the move, Twitter turns saffron right from the login page.
    What is BJP saying?
“We are proud of it. This is a milestone in Indian History.”, said BJP spokesperson. He continues with, “We are now starting Convert-to-India movement and this latest acquisition of Dorsey into BJP fold is the first step.”. It is no longer about just having Indian CEOs but more about making American CEOs Indians as well.
Rumors are agog that BJP is aggressively talking to Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Apple’s Tim Cook to join BJP showing the success and ease of doing business under Gujarat model. Indians merely become CEOs is a thing of past and of no significance. CEOs will become Indians is the new fad.
America’s response
Trump is furious and stopped talking and tweeting to and about Modi. His last tweet to Modi is “Khaaa” before parting ways. For the uninitiated, “KHAA” is used by children to denote they are no longer you friends.

Wrong words prised up lid of criticism,"KANPUR: Electronic modes provide the auto-correct facility. We are quite familiar with this handy, useful format. Whether it is our mobile phone or tablet or laptop, this arrangement gives a relief. However, it sometimes turns out to be a bane when autocorrect system changes the very meaning of the written word. In this regard, a mention that we had seen on actress Mahira, her son and her mother surprised us. This happened thus: When the famed actress Mahira wrote her son’s name Azlaan, it soon changed first into ‘assuming’ and later as ‘Azure’. It was only correctly spelt in her third final endeavour.
The story did not conclude at that very error. Mahira’s mother wrote ‘O.K. Meri Jaan’ in answer to her daughter. But quickly it autocorrected ‘O.K. Japan.’ This reminds of the same issue of classroom’s spellings’ mistake which is still a big burden to the students of the English-medium schools. They write weird spellings and even their copies are checked with the correct sign. A poet wrote, ‘There is no time to stand and stare’ which seems to have been entered into our incorrect writing. The mechanical method of auto-correction is also proving to be redundant with these kinds of reports.
As recently as on last Tuesday morning, a school van appeared running with the wrongly written word ‘SENT Mary’ in place of ‘St. Mary’s’ on the spacious open smooth road in the Cantonment area here. What was surprisingly worse was that even the students have missed this error in the bold letters. The driver could be unaware of the difference between the two contradictory words but how can the disciplined students be? If an actress like Mahira could feel uneasiness on the mistake, a layman also could not avoid at the first sight. Is this a slang form of the foreign language?",SOCIALMEDIA

The 30 year old business man from Mira Road, who is a regularly commutes by local train, asked for a single buttock in his next birth in his prayers. The reason for this unique request was to enable him to sit as the fourth passenger on a local train seat meant for three.

Leaving me with that uncomfortable fourth seat, where one of my buttock in left hanging without support. By the end of the day I am left with one sore butt. So my only prayer to the almighty is to give me just one buttock.”
Hiren’s request struck a chord with many other passengers who have been braving heavy rush in local trains for all these years. A city based cosmetic surgeon even offered to surgically remove one of Hiren’s buttock free of charge. “Why wait for the next birth. I will help this man in this life itself,” said the doctor.
After this news went viral on social media, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal assured that he’d set up a special committee to study and find out a solution to this problem. The committee will be headed by a retired IIT professor and a report is expected to to tabled in a year.
TV personality Ekta Kapoor, moved by Hiren’s plight, will produce a TV show titled Agle Janam Mohe Ek Buttock Hi Dijo, that will revolve around local train travelers. Tusshar Kapoor will play the protagonist in the series.",SOCIALMEDIA
Woman who shifted from Delhi to Mumbai gains 5kgs in 5 days after not having to run due to eve teasing,"Mumbai: As compared to Mumbai and Kolkata where citizens sharply react to any incident of molestation or eve-teasing, such reactions are totally lacking or missing on the part of citizens of Delhi who have a vital role to play in preventing harassment to the women traveling in the city. A live example has come to our notice yesterday.
A woman, who had shifted from Delhi to Mumbai a few days back due to work commitments found out that she had gained 5 kgs in 5 days without even changing any dietary habits or any weather conditions.
Priyanka Ranaut, who works for an MNC shifted to Mumbai 5 days back. And in those 5 days, she never ran away due to any eve teaser harassing her, which was quite common in Delhi. But that scenario had created havoc in her personal life. Gaining 5 kgs in 5 days, she doesn’t where will it all stop.
If the same situation continues, she might gain a lot of weight which will be fatal to health. Many Gyms across the city have sent her their brochure of losing weight in a 30-day challenge or cashback offers.
The Maharashtra government is using this news to boast about the good law and order situation in Mumbai and has promised that to deal with issues which priyanka had to face, the government will subsidize Gym expenditures every month for women.",SOCIALMEDIA
'Just trying to fit into Delhi culture by brandishing gun' says ex-BSP MP's son over accusation,"Putting across his side of the story, ex- BSP MPs son Ashish Pandey admitted that he did brandish a gun as seen in the video but it was done to fit into the typical Delhi culture.
While elaborating on the ‘typical Delhi culture’, he said, “It’s a Delhi thing you know. When ‘tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai’ doesn’t work then you whip out your gun. It’s done as a scare tactic and no to actually shoot someone.”
“I am from Lucknow and even fights over there done with tehzeeb. I would be treated like an outcast if I tried that in Delhi. So I had to carry a gun and a baseball bat in my car to just to show that I am part of Delhi’s high society,” he added.
South Delhi businessman SK Khurana, though hesitant initially, did agree that these things are common in Delhi and media shouldn’t overreact. “Why is that Arnab behaving like a rabid mongrel over this issue. If he hadn’t brandished the weapon then it would have been a national crisis,” he said.
“I remember once I had an argument with a man after he cut me in traffic. We were talking like gentlemen and sorting the issue when some bystanders got restless and asked when are we going to start fighting. They were not happy with our politeness and wanted to hear some cuss words,” he recollected.
A senior bureaucrat, while commenting in the incident said that people coming from outside should respect the culture of Delhi. “Please liberally flaunt your political connections. Invest in a gun if you can afford it, especially the high society types. Carry a baseball bat in you car to start a road rage without provocation. In fact car dealers should give baseball bats as standard accessory,” he suggested.",SOCIALMEDIA

Lets come straight to the news. A college in Mumbai actually witholded aMechanical Engineer’s degree as he was dating a girl which is against the traditions of the Mechanical batch.

TV serial ends after showing what happened in last episode and what will come in next episode,"Bengaluru: Chirag, a software engineer who has spent last 2 years watching Sambit Patra, Arnab Goswami, Rajdeep Sardesai etc in action, decided to switch to another serial, Silsila Badalte Rishton Ka.
He is very disappointed with the progress in the serial much like his career’s progress in the IT company he is working right now.
“Not sure if the serial’s writers fell sick or something. Last week I saw a ‘new episode’, where the content was, what was shown in last episode and what will come in next episode. Arre bhai, iss episode ka Kya? Only half a dozen brand promotions by Amitabh Ji, to see that I have to pay so much to Tata Sky”, said upset looking Chirag.
During Prime time, Chirag switched from his favorite serial in republic TV to Silsila Badalate … after some of his friends recommended him to check this new age progressive serial with “bold” content on extra marital affairs.
“Mere dost baat karte the, check the chemistry between Kunal, Mauli and Nandini (lead characters of the serial) which comes in various permutation and combination as dreamt by the writers of the serial. Mujhe abhi tak kuch khaas dikhne ko nahin mila”, said Chirag.
He added, “It’s a sad state of affairs. Writers of news channels work harder than our TV serial writers”.

Filmmakers hold protest against actress who blamed Filmmaker Sajid Khan for sexual harassment ask the actress to not call Sajid Khan a ‘Filmmaker’ ,"Mumbai: The #MeToo movement has been gaining momentum across the country with more and more women coming out to tell their ordeal. And with every passing day, allegations against big Bollywood names are surfacing. Director Sajid Khan is the latest to join a long list of Indian celebrities who have been accused of sexual harassment.
As many as three women—an assistant director, an actress, and a journalist—have come forth accusing him of sexually harassing them. But filmmakers are really angry with the actresses.
The reason is weird and correct at the same time. The filmmakers say that calling Sajid a filmmaker is an insult to the whole community. ‘Housefull’, Himmatwala and Humshakkals should not be called as films and the maker of such films should not be called as a filmmaker is what the protesters demanded.
Even some police officers who are handling the Sajid Khan case and who have watched his films have asked the actresses to not use the word ‘filmmaker’ in their FIRs.
On Friday morning, actor Akshay Kumar announced his decision to cancel the shoot of Sajid’s directorial Housefull 4 until “further investigation”. Sajid himself stepped down as director of Housefull 4, and urged “friends in the media to kindly not pass judgment till the truth is out”",ENTERTAINMENT
Bollywood facing a shortage of scriptwriters as most are busy writing encounter stories for UP police,"Lucknow: The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government has very proudly announced success in “controlling crime” by instilling the ‘fear of God’ through a spree of police encounters. The Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have carried out as many as 1,478 encounters over a span of 14 months, leaving 62 outlaws dead and 390 wounded.
But Bollywood is facing the wrath of increasing number of encounters in UP. Actually, an encounter needs a dramatic story to be told to the media to make them realize the impact as well as the importance of the encounter.
And that’s the reason there is a great demand for scriptwriters in Lucknow right now and the pay is lucrative too. Many writers have already shifted base and many are in the process of doing so.
The UP police is checking previous records and work profile of the writers so that the stories don’t come out to be a comedy or a boring one. Dramatic writers and writers who have written hardcore blockbusters have been preferred as we write.
Writers of Ekta Kapoor serials have been given extra lucrative to come to UP and write encounter stories as their ability to create drama in the long lasting serials is of no doubt. Many TV anchors who also create a lot of drama have been offered jobs with the UP police.",ENTERTAINMENT

Salman Khan clarified his stance on the #MeToo movement by speaking to Faking News reporter.

You can all of my last 5-6 films, never has the female character been given substantial role and there is a reason behind this. I have been supporting the #MeToo campaign much before it actually became a big campaign.”
Salman also added that Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan support the cause, even more, and that is the reason they work in fewer films so that they don’t get attracted to a woman on sets and harass her sexually. Well, we should also be proud of actors like Fardeen Khan, Tusshar Kapoor and Uday Chopra for staying in homes and not going to work on film sets where the dignity of a woman is always put to test.",ENTERTAINMENT

I have full faith that Mallya will be a changed person once he returns to India and he will definitely return all the money”, Jaitley added. This gives out a strong message to the people who thought that the Finance Ministry did nothing to stop Mallya from fleeing the country.",ENTERTAINMENT
Chandigarh parents trash their son who topped in exams for failing to clear Roadies audition,"Chandigarh: Roadies is such a big thing for the parents in Chandigarh. Though they have already passed the age to compete in roadies, they want their kids to fulfill their dreams. Whenever a child is born in Chandigarh the doctor says, ‘Aapke ghar roadies hua hai’. And that gives the encouragement to parents to put their children in physical training for roadies.

Shooting of Big Boss halted after ‘Big Boss‘ himself gets a call from Kaleen Bhaiya and has to leave,"Some things which come to mind when we talk about the controversial reality show Big Boss is celebrity guests, fights, abuses, Salman Khan and last but not the least, the commanding presence or in this case the absence of Big Boss himself. The booming, authoritative voice commands respect and contestants have never doubted or revolted against Big Boss. Big Boss has always managed to send awe, fear and respect down the spine of the Big Boss 12 contestants, just like it did to the other contestants in the previous seasons.
But in a bizarre incident which happened yesterday, the shooting was halted as the man himself, the ‘Big Boss ‘had to leave citing a strange reason. The whole incident happened when a contestant was called into the confession room by Big Boss. Before he could say anything to the contestant, his phone rang, and there was fear in his voice. He said ‘Kaleen Bhaiya ne bulaya hai’ and left from the shooting location.
The contestant and the organizers were left shell-shocked as without Big Boss the shooting is not possible. The organizers were seen trying to find who Kaleen Bhaiya is from various sources but got no information. For people who thought, Big Boss was the highest authority in the showbiz, yesterday was an eye-opener. Even Big Boss follows and respects the order of someone else.
Faking News reporter spoke to the production executive of the show and he had this to say, “There was a shiver in his voice. At first, we thought he is acting and trying to be funny to make the atmosphere a bit lighter for the contestants, but no, in 5 minutes he was out of the sets. My boys tried to follow him, but he repeated the phrase that ‘Kaleen Bhaiya ne bulaya hai’. We have never heard of any Kaleen Bhaiya. But my request to Kaleen Bhaiya, if he is watching this interview is that please take any celebrity contestant if you want, but give us back our ‘Big Boss’.
Police have started an investigation in this matter, but have not found any clues leading to Kaleen Bhaiya. Our reporters are constantly tracking the investigation and we will keep you updated on the latest happenings.  It is our humble request to our readers to get in touch with us in case they have any information on Kaleen Bhaiya.",ENTERTAINMENT
Man caught sending unsolicited images of KRK to women Arrested ,"Mumbai:
On Friday, a resident of Noida was arrested by the UP Police after a couple of women on Social Media accused him of sending unsolicited pics of KRK (Kamal R Khan). A Twitter user alleged that the man had sent her explicit pictures of KRK and calling it funny. Soon more and more women joined her, making it a social media campaign.
A girl tweeted:
“This man sends KRK’s pics thinking they’re funny. No, they’re not. You can’t do this under the garb of comedy!”
She also tagged his employer asking him to immediately fire the man from his job. 
UP Police responded to the series of tweets saying that they will look into the matter on priority. However, by then the man had issued an apology for his behaviour and cited his poor medical condition as a reason behind watching Deshdrohi and consequently sharing KRK images all day all night.

"Salman to shoot Race 4, 5 and 6 in one go to make most of Govt’s fuel price cut","In an effort to make most of Maharashtra Govt’s fuel price cut, Bollywood actor Salman Khan announced that he’d be shooting the next three installment of his Race franchise in one go.
The price cut has brought relief to the makers of the movie who had almost shelved Race 4 owing to petrol prices touching 90 in Mumbai.
“You never know when the prices may rise again. Our movie involves a lot of cars and racing and very little acting. Most of our budget is spent on fuel. So this move by Govt has reduced the cost by 50%,” said Producer of the movie.
When questioned as to how they plan to complete the movie production before the prices rise again, he said, “Scripting usually takes the maximum time while making a movie. But since this is a Salman movie, there are no scripts. He will just show up at the movie studio and do some random scenes. Will throw in a few dance steps by Katrina and few race scenes. That’s it! The movie is done.”
Apparently, Salman too is very eager to commence the shoot after Race 3 ‘success’. “There are many Bollywood star kids who are currently out of work. They all want Race franchise to do for them what Race 3 did for Bobby Deol,” said a source.
Meanhwhile, Spokesperson for the ruling party Mr. Sambit Patra went all out praising the achievements of his Govt. He said that by cutting fuel prices PM has also given rozgaar to star kids.
“This should be a slap on the face of those who say Govt is doing nothing for unemployment,” he said while speaking in a debate on Republic TV.",ENTERTAINMENT
Telecom company replies to Pritam's complaint of not getting a dialer tone saying they are afraid he might copy it,"Mumbai: In a shocking incident which happened in Mumbai, a telecom company has pruned the dialer tone from the mobile phone of music director Pritam. Every mobile phone handset gets dialer tone when someone dials a number. But for Pritam, the service was pruned last week when the company realized that he may copy it and make a song out of it. 
The whole incident came to light on Thursday when Pritam got a reply email from the telecom company. Actually, one week back when Pritam realized that whenever he dials a number he was not able to listen to any dialer tone, he registered a complaint at the IIN network. IIN network engineers did s thorough investigation and found out that dialer tone services are stopped for Anu Malik, Pritam, and some other music directors. This was after some strict orders from the top brass who felt that the dialer tone if made into a hit song by Pritam, will become so viral that people will think that Pritam has made it and will give all credit to Pritam.
The IIN network is now making a list of people who copy tweets, music, projects and other important things to make sure that such people don’t get caller tunes, dialer tones and other such type of services which they can then use for their benefits.
Pritam spoke to Faking News and he had this to say, ” I am not saying that I don’t copy tunes, but why should I copy a dialer tone. Do you think the tune of Dialer tone can be made into a Bollywood song? It’s impossible. In fact. I had tried it once but it didn’t happen. I have assured the telecom company that I won’t copy the dialer tone.",ENTERTAINMENT

Progress on Dhoni’s biopic slows down as Sushant finds it hard to play with low strike rate as current Dhoni,"New Delhi: We have good news for all the Sushant Singh Rajput fans out there. The sequel to the 2016 hit film M S Dhoni: The Untold Story is on the cards and Sushant Singh Rajput will reprise his role in the film. The second installment will focus on Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s life after the 2011 world cup victory and it will also document different facets of his personal life. It has been observed by many fans that Dhoni after the 2011 World Cup has been too slow in scoring and has been playing defensive cricket. His die-hard fans believe that Dhoni has matured over the years and so he takes time in building his innings. Sushant Singh has started practicing defensive shots. Defending full tosses is a difficult art and it requires great dedication.
Sushant wants to play it real, the way Dhoni does it with calm and ease.
Post-2011, MSD has been taking up the role of sheet anchor and has taken the unnecessary burden on his shoulders. Sushant wants to bring this aspect to the new biopic. The new biopic will also focus on the careers of Parthiv Patel, Saha, Dinesh Karthik and Rishab Pant, which were destroyed by Dhoni’s presence in the team. The biopic will also show how Pune owners were against Dhoni’s slow captaincy and had to replace him with Steve Smith and also the CSK triumph in 2018 after a gap of 2 years in IPL.
Sushant is also hearing a lot of Stump mic recordings as post-2011 Dhoni has been heard a lot behind the stumps and less in press conferences. For the next 30 days, Sushant will only practice defending full tosses and will focus on other aspects afterward.",ENTERTAINMENT
"After Taimur fails to comment on the Tanushree-Nana molestation case, reporter writes 'Bollywood quiet on sexual harassment'","Mumbai: Actress Tanushree Dutta hasn’t received any legal notice from Nana Patekar, she told news agency yet again on Tuesday. Tanushree has also accused Nana Patekar of sending goons to intimidate her after she walked out of a special song sequence because of his alleged inappropriate behavior. But reporters are angry with Bollywood not being vocal enough for sexual harassment cases.
Yesterday, a reporter named Shwetank Malik wrote a piece on how Bollywood has stayed quiet on all major issues. His evidence was the fact that Taimur has still not commented on the Tanushree-Nana saga yet. He had personally visited Taimur to ask about his views on the whole sexual harassment problem which has been a black mark on Bollywood for long. But Taimur was quiet for the whole interview, in fact, he didn’t pay any attention to the question and was busy playing with his toy.
Shwetank has a valid point. If star kids like Taimur don’t speak up now, they will also become an integral part of the dirty system that is Bollywood. There is no one to trust now. Shwetank even tried asking the same question to Tushaar Kapoor’s 2-year-old kid and Farah Khan’s three kids but no one came in support of Tanushree. Looks like Tanushree doesn’t have the support of the industry which she is very much a part of.
When will this hypocrisy end? There doesn’t seem to be a silver lining in the whole incident. Powerful men will keep burying such cases under the carpet and important personalities like Taimur will never speak up for the issue.",ENTERTAINMENT

He further said,  “I ‘ve no issues with same – sex marriage being legalised, as long as they don’t make it mandatory, because eventually all marriages become same sex marriages.”
Shirish is a ‘Sex Guru’ at the world famous ‘Playboy Magazine’, where his articles guides many love birds and is breaking the internet regularly, now looking forward to add a lot of spice with interesting sex stories and scenes in his films too. Currently, he is busy casting for the film and producer Karan Johar along with actor Ranbir Kapoor shall do a cameo role aswell in his film which shall be a path breaking scene for the LGBT community.
Shirish also added, “I personally love ‘Rainbow Roses’  and 69 i.e 6th September, is an historic date for the LGBT communities so it should be celebrated as “LGBT = Lets Grow Bushes n Trees” Day. More public should do plantations and increase forests for making love like Adam and Eve. ‘HOLI’ should be declared as the official festival of the LGBT community, since it’s the most colorful festival played with each others lovers. Infact, I have changed my display picture, which was boring black and white to Rainbow color ‘S’ alphabet in support of the LGBT rights.”
“Life is colorful like the Rainbow screensavers of color tv, which I admired always during my teenage days, when programmes were not aired and the only screen saver was seen is Rainbow stripes. I don’t understand why the Arabs wear white gowns while South Indians wear white lungis. I always prefer wearing my ‘Rainbow Lungi’ while driving my Royal Enfield. Infact, coming Sunday, I am even going to change the color of my Royal Enfield bike to Rainbow color.”
Since, yesterday’s historic decision by court, at every traffic signal, now the sale of ‘Rainbow Color Dusters’ have increased for car dusting. Many are seen purchasing Rainbow color umbrellas for monsoon, while Rainbow Wigs have become famous amongst college prom nights.
Hotels and Airlines have declared 69% off for LGBT communities, where as housing societies and corporates are welcoming LGBT groups. Railways have announced to have one compartment reserved only for LGBT community with a Rainbow décor to add to its beauty.
In another breaking news, during this interview, now public are demanding to rename ‘GTB nagar’ as ‘LGBT Nagar’ whereas ‘Andheri’ as ‘Rainbow’ since Andheri is never black, but its very colorful as Rainbow,  as majority of Bollywood LGBT communities stay there. Well, I am personally hoping GOA Tourism shall change their tagline to GAY i.e “GAY = GOA ALL YEAR” !!",ENTERTAINMENT
Karan Johar disguised as female nurse to launch Shahid Kapoor’s second child,"Wednesday evening came as a blessing for Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput as they were blessed with a baby boy. Mira had been admitted to Mumbai’s Hinduja hospital where she gave birth to her second child.
There were many shocks and surprises which came along. As per reports, lead nurse started humming ‘Kuch Kuch hota hai’ tone seconds before the birth of baby. She turned out to be Karan Johar who had disguised as female nurse, just to launch Shahid Kapoor’s second Child. ‘I always launch star kids. No damn institution or profession can take this right away from me. Why not to introduce them to real world apart from reel world. I did it singlehandedly as always. ’ screamed cheerful Johar when confronted by media.
Between, bollywood fraternity poured their wishes on Kapoor family for this wonderful day. Manish Malhotra, an ace fashion designer and close aid of Kjo came with set of clothes that surprisingly were perfect fit to new born. ‘Though news came as a surprise to me, but I had costumes ready for Jacqueline for her new movie. I grabbed the set and rushed to the hospital. They are hardly covering the toddler any extra than needed.’ said Malhotra giving rest to undue praise he was getting for his simple act of common sense. ‘He and I have always been down to earth in all our endeavors’ double meant Johar while controlling his tears.
However Misha Kapoor, elder sister of new born expressed her disappointment and held Kjo responsible for unwanted delays. ‘I could have got Rakhi gift this year if it was not Kjo delaying the climax with unwanted songs’ she complained. As per reports Kapoor family is planning to name new born Shami. ‘Rocket science used in naming Misha will again be used. This way he will never be confused with Shammi Kapoor and Mohammad Shami’ revealed a close friend of family on assuarance of keeping his name disclosed.",ENTERTAINMENT
What if PC declares finally,"When ould Priyanka spoil her film career for marriage? Marriage for the Desi girl is as important as continuing her film career. Her preference for the Hollywood film Cowboy Ninja Viking opposite Chris Pratt might have forced her to walk out of Salman Khan’s Bharat. Would she fancy spoiling her fabulous film career for marriage?
Famous as Desi girl she has nearly chosen Nick as a life partner though she was desperately concealing the ring in her jeans pocket. Whatever should be told about her wedding plan, she was supposed to announce something in the ongoing month. A very popular pair has announced nuptial day. What goes wrong if Pee Cee also takes the initiative in the same way. Indications were directing towards marriage plans but a concrete decision is yet to come.
Nick Jonas indicated positively by expressing his thanks to those wishing him happy engagement. He looked a little bit more open and expressive in hinting at the final wedding plan of his life. The rest will come from Priyanka in ensuing days. Why she has selected an American groom can be a hot topic. If Priyanka is 36, Nick is 26 at present. If she is a pure Indian, he is strictly American.
The American singer Nick desires Priyanka Chopra because her encounter made a decisive impression upon him. He was keenly or impulsively inclined in favour of whatever the ladylove wishes. He was pulling out all the stops when it comes to currying favour with the dearly loved. For her, an American partner is suiting most.
Besides Bollywood and Hollywood, even Duchess Meghan Markel was reportedly dying to be a bridesmaid at their nuptials. However, Priyanka appeared to be the mediator like Valentine and Nick remained a mediated subject matter like Proteus of Shakespeare’s ‘The Two Gentlemen of Verona.’",ENTERTAINMENT
How Crime Patrol helped an innocent child get back his first love,"Bunty was busy doing his never-ending homework when the idea hit him. It was so convincing that he couldn’t hold back his tears. All the pieces of evidence were pointing in one direction and one direction only- that his parents were guilty. He couldn’t believe it, but the series of events flashed before his eyes. It can’t be a mere coincidence. It was all planned from Day 1. Suddenly, a fear gripped him. Is he safe in this house or his parents are plotting against him in their room?
Perhaps, that’s why they don’t allow him to sleep with them anymore so that they can plot against him at night. He knew that getting the truth out of them is not going to be easy, but he knew what needs to be done. After all, he has been watching Crime Patrol since his infant days and now that he was in UKG, his database included 330 cases of different crimes and evidence gathering techniques.
Without wasting any time, he started to gather evidence. To begin with he tried to listen to his parents’ talks after they went to their bedroom. The voice was fumbled, and the evidence was non-conclusive. He knew that time is of the essence and he needs to think something fast. He tried to contact his local informer, his granny, but to no avail. Granny was also caught unaware of the whole plan. Then he decided to take the inquiry head-on and apply third-degree torture to his parents to get the truth out of them. He mustered all the courage he had and told his parents that he won’t have dinner until his parents told him the truth. This turned out to be his checkmate move and his parents got caught in a tough spot. Finally, they were willing to cooperate.
That’s when Bunty asked them the question which has been bothering him day in and day out. The question due to which he was not able to focus on his first love and next-door neighbor Babli for past 2 weeks. “Is Bunty’s tuition teacher giving him so much homework based on their instructions (or their ‘Plan’ as Bunty liked to think of it)”. Initially, his parents denied, but Bunty knew he had to increase the intensity of the torture for them to relent. So, he said that he will have to skip the breakfast tomorrow as well, to get the truth. Exactly at this point in time, his mom burst into tears and accepted her crime. Bunty’s daily mobile gaming habits to impress Babli was getting onto her and finally, she took this hideous path which turned out to be a point of no return. She told him how she requested his tuition teacher to give him extra homework so that he can be occupied and focus on studies rather than playing with Babli whole day.
Bunty knew he had solved the case, and he only had Crime Patrol and Anoop Soni to thank for it.  When Faking News correspondent reached out to Bunty to congratulate him on solving this case, he was very happy to get back his lost love. Babli told our correspondent “Jab dil me ho Bunty, to kya bigaad legi Aunty”. And Bunty’s pearls of wisdom were: “Savdhan rahein, Satark rahein aur dekhte rahein Crime Patrol”.",ENTERTAINMENT

"‘Saas Bahu’ serials making viewers retarded, doctors perplexed","Mumbai: In a study which has perplexed neurologists and radiologists across the world, it has been found that Indian ‘Saas Bahu’ TV serial viewers suffered from early cerebral atrophy than those who did not watch, and that they are hazardous to the human brain.
In a double blinded randomized control study on the idiotic and irritating Indian TV serial viewers over 10 years, it has been found that the serials have added 0 % intellectual growth in its viewers, with shows defying all logic and have made many sane viewers go retard over time. With serials which seem to have no end but are more like ‘Draupadi ka cheer’ instead, the study concluded that India is fast slipping into becoming the greatest nation in the world when it comes to dumbness.
From Sasural Simar Ka to Saath Nibhana Saathiya to Balika Vadhu, the rotten Indian TV soap industry has now made a reputation of pretty much having the same core theme – a good for nothing husband and a powerful/cruel mother and their innocent Daughter in law; daughter in law facing all kinds of cruel treatments from the family; unbelievable number of kidnappings / injuries /divorces, etc; and the family’s favorite time pass being organization of functions every next episode with dance performances without any reason. Unconfirmed reports have claimed that even the actors of these serials laugh after watching the brainless sequences.
The Indian Neurology Society has called for a ban on these serials with legal proceedings against their directors for fooling and making people dumb. The ruling BJP government has meanwhile supported the study and claimed that Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s low IQ was also due to these serials, with mother Sonia Gandhi rubbishing the claim and stating that ‘he’ was just an untimely accident.",ENTERTAINMENT
Mumbai man prays for single buttock in next birth to enable him to sit comfortably as fourth passenger on seat meant for three in local train,"While most people pray for wealth, health, job and relationship, Hiren Desai had something which even the Gods would be shocked to hear. The 30 year old business man from Mira Road, who is a regularly commutes by local train, asked for a single buttock in his next birth in his prayers. The reason for this unique request was to enable him to sit as the fourth passenger on a local train seat meant for three.
Speaking to Faking News Hiren said, “I have been travelling by train since last ten years. And all the seats are already taken when I enter the compartment. Leaving me with that uncomfortable fourth seat, where one of my buttock in left hanging without support. By the end of the day I am left with one sore butt. So my only prayer to the almighty is to give me just one buttock.”
Hiren’s request struck a chord with many other passengers who have been braving heavy rush in local trains for all these years. A city based cosmetic surgeon even offered to surgically remove one of Hiren’s buttock free of charge. “Why wait for the next birth. I will help this man in this life itself,” said the doctor.
After this news went viral on social media, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal assured that he’d set up a special committee to study and find out a solution to this problem. The committee will be headed by a retired IIT professor and a report is expected to to tabled in a year.
TV personality Ekta Kapoor, moved by Hiren’s plight, will produce a TV show titled Agle Janam Mohe Ek Buttock Hi Dijo, that will revolve around local train travelers. Tusshar Kapoor will play the protagonist in the series.",ENTERTAINMENT
Woman who shifted from Delhi to Mumbai gains 5kgs in 5 days after not having to run due to eve teasing,"Mumbai: As compared to Mumbai and Kolkata where citizens sharply react to any incident of molestation or eve-teasing, such reactions are totally lacking or missing on the part of citizens of Delhi who have a vital role to play in preventing harassment to the women traveling in the city. A live example has come to our notice yesterday.
A woman, who had shifted from Delhi to Mumbai a few days back due to work commitments found out that she had gained 5 kgs in 5 days without even changing any dietary habits or any weather conditions.
Priyanka Ranaut, who works for an MNC shifted to Mumbai 5 days back. And in those 5 days, she never ran away due to any eve teaser harassing her, which was quite common in Delhi. But that scenario had created havoc in her personal life. Gaining 5 kgs in 5 days, she doesn’t where will it all stop.
If the same situation continues, she might gain a lot of weight which will be fatal to health. Many Gyms across the city have sent her their brochure of losing weight in a 30-day challenge or cashback offers.
The Maharashtra government is using this news to boast about the good law and order situation in Mumbai and has promised that to deal with issues which priyanka had to face, the government will subsidize Gym expenditures every month for women.",ENTERTAINMENT
'Just trying to fit into Delhi culture by brandishing gun' says ex-BSP MP's son over accusation,"Putting across his side of the story, ex- BSP MPs son Ashish Pandey admitted that he did brandish a gun as seen in the video but it was done to fit into the typical Delhi culture.
While elaborating on the ‘typical Delhi culture’, he said, “It’s a Delhi thing you know. When ‘tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai’ doesn’t work then you whip out your gun. It’s done as a scare tactic and no to actually shoot someone.”
“I am from Lucknow and even fights over there done with tehzeeb. I would be treated like an outcast if I tried that in Delhi. So I had to carry a gun and a baseball bat in my car to just to show that I am part of Delhi’s high society,” he added.
South Delhi businessman SK Khurana, though hesitant initially, did agree that these things are common in Delhi and media shouldn’t overreact. “Why is that Arnab behaving like a rabid mongrel over this issue. If he hadn’t brandished the weapon then it would have been a national crisis,” he said.
“I remember once I had an argument with a man after he cut me in traffic. We were talking like gentlemen and sorting the issue when some bystanders got restless and asked when are we going to start fighting. They were not happy with our politeness and wanted to hear some cuss words,” he recollected.
A senior bureaucrat, while commenting in the incident said that people coming from outside should respect the culture of Delhi. “Please liberally flaunt your political connections. Invest in a gun if you can afford it, especially the high society types. Carry a baseball bat in you car to start a road rage without provocation. In fact car dealers should give baseball bats as standard accessory,” he suggested.",ENTERTAINMENT
College withholds Mechanical engineer's degree for being in relationship with a girl,"Mumbai: 10 reasons to fall in love with mechanical engineers – do you know why smart girls prefer dating a mechanical engineer? Mechanical engineers are some of the best people to date with. A good sense of logic, better salary, better communication, extra technical knowledge about almost everything makes a mechanical engineer a perfect guy to date. Enough of these jokes now. Lets come straight to the news. A college in Mumbai actually witholded aMechanical Engineer’s degree as he was dating a girl which is against the traditions of the Mechanical batch.
The news started with Sanil Malik a 4th-year student of Enimity Engineering college. He was dating a girl for the last 2 years, all these in hideouts as he was too embarrassed to tell this to his fellow batchmates. Mechanical Engineers are the Bhisma Pitamah of the current generation, where even talking to a girl is against traditions, parampara as they call it. His act was caught just 2 days before his convocation and he had to speak the truth then as his roaming with the girl was caught on CCTV cameras too. The college had never allowed any student from the mechanical batch to fall in love with a girl.
And Sanil was the latest victim of the tradition-face-off. Sanil has been told to spend one full year in the college living a single life without any relationship as part of the punishment.",ENTERTAINMENT
Messi's email account flooded with health check packages from Indian Diabetes doctors after Maradona's '20 times loo' comment,"Mumbai: If you notice you’re peeing a lot — meaning that you’re urinating more often than what’s normal for you — it’s possible your frequent urination could be an early sign of diabetes. However, there are many potential causes of frequent urination, including some that are harmless. We got this information from a healthcare website. Argentina legend Diego Maradona’s categorization of Lionel Messi as ‘not a leader’ left plenty of fans, family members and international teammates bemused. 
Maradona had said: “Messi’s a great player, but he’s not a leader. Before talking to the coach and players, he’ll play on the PlayStation. Then, on the pitch, he wants to be the leader. He’s the best along with Cristiano Ronaldo but for me, it’s pointless to make a leader out of a man who goes to the bathroom 20 times before a match.” And Messi had to pay the price for Maradona’s comments. Today morning when he got up, he was surprised to see his phone hang due to 1000s of emails from Indian Diabetes doctors. Everyone had the same reply, ‘FREQUENT URINATION IS A SIGN OF DIABETES’. Messi received health check packages from all leading dostors of India and he was left confused as to what to do with such messages.
Some doctors had in fact personally visited him this morning as they see a business opportunity in Messi’s disease. The doctors have promised a commission to Maradona which may go upto many millions of dollars. To have a patient like Messi is a dream for many doctors and Indian doctors have surely got a big opportunity to cash in on.",SPORTS
Water served by Karun Nair was too hot: Selectors explain decision to drop Karun Nair,"Mumbai: Indian squad for the upcoming Test series against West Indies has been announced and the one surprising thing was the omission of Karun Nair. Nair, who was part of the squad for the entire England tour without getting a game, was dropped from the 15 members squad announced yesterday.
Speaking to the journalists, Chief Selector MSK Prasad said,” We decided to drop some players after the England tour due to their poor performances there. Dhawan and Vijay were dropped because they failed to provide consistent starts at the top and Karun Nair was dropped for failing to do his duty of carrying water bottles effectively.”
When asked how did Nair fail in carrying water, he said,” The water must reach the players at the right temperature to satiate their thirst and to energise them. We saw that the water was too hot by the time it reached the players from the fridge in the dressing room. That means Nair was moving too slowly while carrying the drinks out so we had to drop him on fitness grounds.”
Asked if there is a way back for Nair in the team, Mr. Prasad said,” Obviously, the door is always open. He has to learn to move fast while carrying water bottles and hopefully he practices that after this wakeup call. Once he is ready, we will conduct an H2O test, similar to the Yo-Yo test but for players on the bench. If he manages to pass that, he can always be included to carry drinks during the Australian tour.”
Meanwhile, new inclusion Mayank Agarwal was seen running around a stadium with 6 water bottles in his hand as he prepares for the series against West Indies.",SPORTS
"If Kohli is free, can you ask him to play for us: Imran Khan calls Narendra Modi","Islamabad: Days after calling Indian PM Narendra Modi a small man, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has done a U-turn and called up his Indian counterpart for help. Concerned with the poor form of his Cricket team in Asia Cup, former captain Imran has asked Virat Kohli on loan for the rest of the tournament.
After defeating Hong Kong convincingly, Pakistan has lost twice to India by huge margins and barely scrapped through against Afghanistan in the other fixture. Now they face a knockout game against Bangladesh and Imran wants to win that match at any cost.
Virat Kohli, the Indian captain and currently the highest rated batsman in the world, is not part of the Indian team for Asia Cup and is resting in India.
Speaking to Faking News, a Pakistan government official said, “This can be the start of a beautiful India-Pakistan friendship if Modi and Kohli agree. Kohli is just doing some advertisements at the moment so he is practically free and we need a batsman so why not?”
When asked why Kohli, he said, “Looks like you haven’t seen our batting in this tournament. Otherwise you wouldn’t have asked this question. However, it is not just his batting that we require, we need at least one player in the team who can take a catch.

A senior official said,” Initially we thought Imran is calling to ask for funds for his dam project and when he said he needs a person from India, we thought maybe he is getting married again and this time to an Indian but we were wrong.

Shikhar Dhawan suffers groin injury after excessively slapping his thigh to celebrate victory over Pak,"Flamboyant Indian batsman Shikhar Dhawan suffered groin injury while celebrating the victory in his trademark ‘thigh slapping’ style.
After scoring a century and beating arch rivals Pakistan, Dhawan was ecstatic and unstoppable with his celebration.
But it seems his thighs were not ready for what was in store for them.
While speaking to the media, team spokesperson said, “Unki janghon me soojan aa gayi hai. Doctors are waiting for the x-ray report. We are hoping that the injury is not as bad as it looks.”
The the cricketer spent the entire day lying on the chair with an ice pack wrapped around his groin and may miss the net practice.
Sources say that the in-form batsman could be ruled out of the next match if the swelling doesn’t get better.
Faking News spoke to team mate Yuzvendra Chahal on what transpired in the dressing room post victory and he said that the team got carried away with celebrations in the dressing room. “Shikhar opened his thighs for other players to slap too. We all were just too happy to have beaten Pak twice. Didn’t realize this would happen,” he said.
Coach Ravi Shastri reprimanded the players and said that the team was behaving like high school kids.
In a strongly worded message he warned the players from taking part in any celebrations and focus on the upcoming matches till the Asia cup is over.",SPORTS
"Media hails Taimur after India's win, says Kedar Jadhav's release point is equal to Taimur's height","Mumbai: Rohit was really happy with the way his bowlers performed, especially Jadhav, who got three important wickets. “Kedar has been working on his bowling, and he takes his bowling seriously. It augurs well for the team, and the wickets are a bonus for us. His overs in middle are very crucial, especially after Hardik’s injury,” Rohit said. Kedar Jadhav’s unconventional release point during delivery stride has made many batsmen go searching for the ball and in the process give away their wicket.
Jadhav has three variations in his bowling, namely, low, lower and lowest. It is very difficult to play against his balls as he never gets any bounce from the pitch. Pakistani team is finding short heightened batsmen in the country to quickly send them to Dubai to tackle Kedar’s bowling. Such is the impact that Kedar has made. Coaches around the world are asking for new bowling machines which can deliver balls from a very low trajectory to make their batsmen simulate the conditions of facing Kedar Jadhav in the matches. TV channels have started placing low trajectory cameras to capture the bowling of Kedar as the normal camera doesn’t show the ball reaching the batsmen as it is too low.
“I certainly haven’t been bowling it all along. But I like creativity so when I was bowling, I realized off-spinners are usual. Anyone who does not know to bowl will bowl off-spin. That’s when I tried a few new things like the sidearm ball and it worked. I tried it in the match and it got me wickets so stuck with it,” Kedar had told a few months back to a news source.",SPORTS
Startup develops gadget that mutes TV whenever Ramiz Raja speaks,"Bengaluru: A Bengaluru based startup has developed a revolutionary gadget that is set to change Cricket watching experience in India. Once connected to the TV, the gadget will automatically mute the sound whenever Ramiz Raja speaks during commentary.
After testing the device during the first India-Pakistan match in the Asia Cup, they are ready for a nationwide release ahead of the next India-Pakistan match in Super 4 stage.
Speaking to the media at the product launch, the company’s chief engineer said, “Technology should always be used to solve the problems faced by the people and Ramiz Raja’s commentary was a problem faced by all the cricket fans. Thousands of people reported bleeding from their ears whenever Ramiz spoke and we just couldn’t let that continue so we came up with this device.”
“Our special feature will ensure that people can still continue to hear the crowd noise and only Ramiz voice is filtered out. Broadcasters are refusing to drop him from the commentary panel, maybe because he took all his salary in advance but we can at least protect the viewers from the assault of his brainless commentary,” he further added.
The company is also working on developing similar device for Sanjay Manjrekar, Danny Morrison and L. Sivaramakrishnan and hopes to launch those products in time for the IPL 2019.",SPORTS
Virat Kohli told to stay within 10 Kms of Airport by BCCI till the Asia Cup concludes,"Delhi: Indian cricket team skipper Rohit Sharma offered up no excuses for India’s lackluster showing against Hong Kong in their opening game of the Asia Cup 2018 but believes that his side will learn from their mistakes. The amount of time it took India to see off Hong Kong will undoubtedly raise questions over why India chose to put out a much-changed starting XI but Rohit defended the changes, stating they were necessitated by the schedule, with India set to face Pakistan on Wednesday. What India also needs is for Kohli to be able to join the team as and when required.
BCCI has asked Virat to stay within 10 km of Airport so that he can be flown to Dubai if the team requires him. Without Virat, Indian team doesn’t look as threatening as they look with him. Just the mere presence of Kohli near the airport would instill fear in the minds of Opponents. Virat is currently having some off time with family after getting rest from a busy schedule and the long England tour.
Kohli has been asked to pack his kit bag and keep at the airport. BCCI will ask him to fly to Dubai as and when they think that the Indian team is in an extremely hapless situation during the Asia Cup.
Meanwhile, Dhawan said India will go with a “positive and strong” mindset against their arch-rivals. “The ideal situation will be to have a break and then play. We all are humans, so we also get tired as well. But at the same time, we are quite strong enough. Once we go and come tomorrow, of course, it’s a big game, and we all are going to be positive and strong.”",SPORTS
Who will do Bhangra in case we win a series: Shastri defends Dhawan’s place in side,"London: Indian Coach and cheerleader Ravi Shastri has hit out at critics questioning opener Shikhar Dhawan’s place in the Indian side. Dhawan had an average series in England averaging just above 20 failing to cross 50 in any of his innings. However, it looks like the Indian management is still firmly behind the Bhangra dancer batsman.
Speaking to the media at the end of the series which India lost 1-4, Shastri said,” It is the job of the media to focus on the negatives because you all are negative people. However, I am a very positive person and I will focus only on the positives. You can look at his string of low scores while playing away from India but I can appreciate his superb Bhangra skills which cheer up the entire squad.”
“As a coach, my job is to see what each player brings to the squad and then provide him the right environment to enhance that. Shikhar brings Bhangra and it is my job to make sure he can improve his dance and perform it as well as he can. At the end of the day, performance matters and his performance in his field of expertise has been exceptional”, Shastri added.
Further, he went on to say,” You all want us to drop Shikhar but tell me one thing, if by mistake we win in Australia, then who will dance during the victory celebrations? As part of the team management, it is my job to make sure we have players for every situation and Dhawan is the player for these celebrations, if and when they come.”
When asked if this means Dhawan’s place is secure for the Australian tour, Shastri said,” Oh no, not at all, we encourage competition for places and if some youngster comes up with better moves, we can always look to promote him.”
We tried to get Shikhar Dhawan’s reaction to Ravi Shastri’s statement but he couldn’t hear us over the sound of Bhangra beats playing in his hotel room.",SPORTS
BCCI arranges Cook's meeting with Amit Shah to convince him to become India's opening batsman,"Mumbai: Alastair Cook said his retirement from international cricket has been an “18-month process” after he ended his Test batting career with a century against India in the fifth Test at The Oval. Cook’s loss will be huge for England given their average opening batsmen. But his retirement can be a blessing in disguise for India as there are chances that he can become India’s opening batsman. BCCI is said to be arranging a secret meeting between Cook and Amit Shah to convince the former that he should play for India as age is on his side.
Cook, who is 33 still has a lot of cricket left in him. Normally an Indian batsman retires at an age of 37-38 after trying to break all records. Amit Shah is known in the political circles as a person who brings people from other parties into his own party and making his party strong. Now the BCCi wants Amit Shah to help the cricket team by bringing Cook as an opening batsman because the opening batsmen on display in England were pathetic in their performance.
Amit Shah is scheduled to meet Cook anytime after the current series. The meeting will be held at BJP headquarters in Delhi. Amit Shah can also give him an incentive of becoming a future Rajya Sabha member to make it more convincing. The ball is now in Cook’s court to decide whether to extend his playing career or not. Once the Cook situation is dealt with, BCCI can then look into other players which it wants to bring to the Indian team, the likes of Kevin Peterson and Mike Hussey who can still contribute to International cricket.",SPORTS
Sony successfully inserts an Ad between bowler releasing the ball and it reaching the batsman,"Mumbai: People enjoying advertisements on Sony Pictures Network these days were left impressed yesterday when they saw an ad between the ball leaving bowler’s hand and the batsman hitting it with his bat during the ongoing coverage of the Indian tour of England. Throughout the series, people have applauded Sony’s commitment to advertisements but this was beyond expectations for even the biggest fans of the broadcaster.
While other sports channels have repeatedly interrupted advertisements in the past to show Cricket action, replays, batsmen coming and going, Captains setting fields etc, Sony has worked hard towards minimizing these distractions and concentrate on running uninterrupted advertisements. However, there was a gap, there was no ad during the time when bowler walks back to his mark, no ad during the time it was taking the ball to reach the batsman, and again no ad during the time it took a ball to reach the boundary line.
Now, Sony has plugged all these gaps and has added clips of advertisers at those times. Speaking to Faking News, an executive producer working for the channel said,” People watch Television to catch up with the latest advertisements. Those who want to follow the Cricket do it online on Cricket websites or on social media. Therefore, it is our duty to show as many advertisements as possible and we are working hard to give the best possible experience to the viewers. In future, we will also insert an ad break between bowler appealing and umpire raising his finger or shaking his head, an ad break between ball passing the batsman and wicketkeeper gathering it and an ad break between ball touching the stumps and bails falling off.”
As per sources, during Indian tour of Australia, Sony will experiment with an uninterrupted advertisement broadcast with the current crore being displayed on the top left-hand corner of the screen.",SPORTS
Ravi Shastri on Jadeja's exclusion in 4 Tests : Wanted to keep him as a surprise element for the next England tour,"London:Jadeja took four wickets in the England first innings, and then lived up to his keenness to be counted again as a Test all-rounder. Jadeja’s unbeaten 86, only behind his career-high 90 against England at home in 2016, pushed his case. 3rd day’s play raised quite a lot of questions on India’s selection policies. Jadeja never got a look in even on a turning track at Southampton. But coach Ravi Shastri has an explanation for the same as he believes that Jadeja’s exclusion from the 4 Tests at the beginning will help Idia in their next tour of England after 4 years.
According to Ravi Shastri, a team which wants to be the best has to have a long-term vision and winning the current series would have been a short-term goal. Shastri believes that the time Jadeja spent on this tour will help him become a better player come 4 years hence when India will tour England again. Shastri and Bangar’s position as coach was seriously questioned by the media after the team’s continuous failures to win overseas. Even in a recently held press conference, Shastri had said that this Indian team is the best in the past 20-25 years.
Shastri also spoke to our Faking News reporter and he had this to say,” Short-term failures are a stepping stone for long-term success. My visions are to make India the best Test playing side, Just give me 10 years more and see the difference. I have been working on the footwork of our batsmen by taking them to discotheques and making them dance, more they dance more will their feet move in the swinging conditions of England.”",SPORTS
"Survive for 1 more Test, then we are coming: West Indies Cricket Board to Rahul and Dhawan","Antigua: Indian openers may be struggling during the tour of England but happy days are just around the corner. West Indies, the great tourists, will be coming to India for a 2 Tests series in October and their Cricket Board, Cricket West Indies (CWI) has sent a message of encouragement to Indian openers KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan.
In an official letter, CWI has reminded the Indian openers that they are coming soon to India so all they have to do is to survive one more Test match in England and then they can go back to making hundreds for fun. Indian openers have struggled during the ongoing series against England with the opening partnership crossing 50 only twice and no opener managing to cross individual score of 50.
However, a home series against West Indies will be the right opportunity for them to hit form and confirming their spot for the winter tour of Australia.
Whenever Indian batsmen have suffered a crisis of confidence in recent years, Sri Lanka or West Indies have stepped up to boost their averages, West Indies even offered a great launch pad to Rohit Sharma who was averaging 288 after his first series against the Caribbean side, and they are ready to restore the confidence of Rahul and Dhawan after a forgettable English tour.
Speaking to Faking News, a CWI official said, “We heard some discussions that India should go in with 7 batsmen in Test cricket because the openers are not contributing at all and there is too much pressure on Kohli to score. Rubbish, they should go in with just 3 batsmen when they face us and we will make sure all of them hit 100s. We have always behaved well as guests in recent years and we will continue to do the same. All Rahul and Dhawan have to do is, survive the final Test with some dignity so that they get picked against us. We will prefer to concede runs to them than to some young kids picked for their debuts.”
As per sources inside the Indian Team, this message has really motivated Rahul and Dhawan and they are determined to score at least 10 runs each to confirm their spot for the series against West Indies.",SPORTS
"India overtakes US to become biggest importer of baseball bats, but the bats are not used to play baseball: Survey","New Delhi: Global Baseball Bat market was valued at 350$ M in 2017 and will reach 410$ M by the end of 2025, CAGR of 2.0%. The industry is booming and India has a big role to play in the market. The US baseball federation has come to know that maximum bats are sold in India. They sent an investigation team to find out how and where are these bats used, as India’s baseball teams have never been in news.
The investigating team found that most bats are used during the road rage in Gurgaon and NCR region. Baseball bats have become the favorite accessory to be kept inside the SUVs that roam around the region. Almost every car has a baseball bat inside. A few years back, the road rage didn’t involve any accessory but the baseball bat has become an instant hit. In fact, according to the survey done by our reporters, we found that the number of bats sold in NCR in a year is equal to the number of bats sold in the US in the last 5 years.
Baseball bats are not only used during road rages. They are used by the goons supporting political parties. Most of the supporters of politicians also keep a baseball bat inside their cars. Policemen use it during their third-degree attempts inside the jails. Parents use it to keep their children on the right track. Belts, belan, sandals are a thing of the past. Parents nowadays in India use baseball bats to shape the career of their kids. Many US companies have approached the Modi government to MAKE the bats IN INDIA.",SPORTS

“We are thankful to Sambit for considering our request, other than Arnab he does not listen to anyone,” said one of the director of the news channel.

This is not the first patriotic film for Akshay who has played everyone from Army Officer to Raw agent to Naval officer to Indian Hockey coach in nationalist films in recent years.
When asked how will he manage to portray the role of a female wrestler, Mr Kumar said, ”Gender is a social construct, we should not let that dictate the selection of actors for any film. I was never an army officer or RAW agent, but I managed to play those roles. I had never held a Hockey stick but I coached Hockey so why can’t I play the role of a female wrestler without being one?”
When someone mentioned that Aamir has already made a film on Phogat sisters, he said, “See, in Aamir’s film, the focus was on him and not on the Phogat sisters. By playing the role of Vinesh Phogat, I will get the entire focus on the wrestler and not on their coach/father. Anyway, you never asked Aamir why he copied Salman’s Sultan so why are you asking me?”

Karun Nair worried BCCI may ask him to refund expenses incurred during England tour,"London: India has made a comeback in the series against England by winning the Trent Bridge Test match but one player in the squad is starting to get a little worried. Karun Nair, who has been a passenger with the team for the last month, is worried that BCCI may send him a bill for his hotel stay, food and travel expenses since he has not been involved with anything on the tour so far.
Nair started worrying about it after the squad for the last two Tests was announced in which BCCI added in-form middle order batsman in Hanuma Vihari further reducing Nair’s chances of getting a game.
Speaking to Faking News on the condition of anonymity, a source inside the team said, “Till yesterday, Nair was repeatedly walking past Shastri and Kohli to remind them that he is also part of this tour. He thought he is not getting any game despite the struggles of the batsmen because they have forgotten about him. However, now he is keeping as far away from the Management as possible as someone may ask who is paying for his 2 months holiday in England.”
“Little hope that he had for playing a Test match on this tour were taken away from him when Shaw and Vihari got selected, both have scored plenty of runs for India A recently. Recency effect will make the Management select them ahead of him and he is worried BCCI may ask him for a refund of all expenses. He is the only one yet to do anything on the tour, even Jadeja has fielded as a substitute on several occasions”, our source added.

BCCI में टूरिंग पार्टी के संभार-तंत्र(logistics) के इंचार्ज चंपत शाह ने OYO Rooms के अंतर्गत होटल ‘सम्राट इंटरनैशनल’ में शास्त्री जी की बुकिंग कराकर डिटेल्स उन्हें ई-मेल कर दिया था। शास्त्री जी को इस बात का पता तब चला जब दुबई में फ़ाईनल की जीत के जश्न को अंजाम तक पहुँचाने के बाद उन्होंने सोचा चलो अब आगे के जश्न का इंतजाम भी देख लिया जाये। उन्होंने बिना ठीक से डिटेल्स चेक किये सीधा होटल के मैनेजर को फोन मिलाकर पूछा – ‘तो भई वहाँ पीने के क्या क्या आॅप्शन्स हैं?’
पर सामने से जो जवाब आया उसे सुनकर शास्त्री जी की सारी की सारी उतर गयी। मैनेजर ने कहा, ‘सर पीने में 2 आॅप्शन्स हैं – चाय और काॅफ़ी। और वो भी सिर्फ़ एक टाईम मिलेगी – सुबह।’ फ़िर शास्त्री जी ने हँसते हुये कहा, ‘अरे भाई, मज़ाक मत करो। मेरा मतलब तो शाम की जाम से था।’ इसपर मैनेजर ने कह दिया कि वहां ये सब नहीं मिलता। तब जाकर शास्त्री जी को एहसास हुआ कि इस बार उनका गुजारा OYO Rooms में ही होने वाला है।
उन्होंने फ़ौरन चंपत शाह को फ़ोन कर पूछा कि उनका स्टे किसी पाँच सितारा होटल में ना कराकर ऐसी घटिया होटल में क्युँ कराया गया है? तो चंपत बाबु उनपर भड़क कर बोले, ‘क्या दिक्कत है इस होटल में? सुबह का नश्ता है, फ़्री wifi है, AC रूम है, टिवी में टाटा स्काई है, दिन में 2 बार रूम की सफ़ाई होगी। पिछले 20 सालों में किसी भी कोच को ऐसा इंतजाम नहीं मिला होगा।’ ये कहकर उन्होंने फ़ोन काट दिया।

Serena Williams shouts,"Sports instruction does not allow any Tennis player to follow what has been defined as unacceptable in the match codebook. The rules are just right on purpose of maintaining the value of keeping a clean court at Arthur Ash stadium in New York.
However, the turn of occurrences in the final encounter of US Open Tennis Tournament belittled the vainness of rapport between the umpire and the player. The chair umpire Carlos Ramos warned Serena Williams for a code violation in regard to her coach’s instructive hint from the spectator’s box.
This objection caused Williams to make her blood boil and she branded the umpire a thief and liar. She also called tournament referee Brian Early to appear. Her reaction brought a game point to the Japanese sensation Naomi Osaka.
Angered with this unfavourable decision, the American tennis star enraged intensely at the umpire and could not stop herself saying: “It was not coaching. I do not cheat to win. I would rather lose. I just want you to know that.” Continuing further she added: “I understand why you might have thought that, but I do want you to know, I do not cheat. Thank you very much.”
Her furious volley in Ramos direction did not stop until she released her entire emotions. She pointed out: “You owe me an apology. You will never umpire on a court of mine as long as you live. You stole a point from me.”
Though the first set of the match ended in only 34 seconds, the second set brought an end of Williams’ expectation of winning 24th grand slam title equivalent to Margaret Court. The Japanese player won her first grand slam by defeating an unyielding strong opponent in the US Open tournament. Williams was handed a penalty point for breaking her racquet.",SPORTS
Apt weather forecasts responsible for loss at Lord's : Virat Kohli,"After heavy defeat in Lord’s, Indian captain Virat Kohli blamed weather forecasts which proved to be correct for loss. “We went with extra spinner instead of a seamer. With all the rain forecasts,  it was evident that pitch would stay dry. Hence playing with extra spinner was definitely a better option. But the conditions remained true to the forecasts leading to the loss.” said a surprised Kohli. Flamboyant Virat Kohli preferred a chinaman Yadav over an indian Yadav after going through all the meteorological forecasts, which he allegedly thought were IMD’s.
As per experts, this poor selection of team haunted india throughout the play. To no one’s surprise Kuldeep Yadav hardly got to ball in seam friendly conditions. Several axed ex cricketers also expressed their disappointment over team selection. “Back in india, meteorological department follows certain rules and never spoil the surprises of weather by predicting them right. How come opposite of the forecast has not happened this time BC?” asked annoyed Kohli to indian origin reporter Indra dev in a never called press conference.
Considering the monopoly of BCCI, there are speculations that IMD will forecast overseas weather also for cricketing interests. “We have talked to senior scientists of meteorological department. They have made us believe that using cloud computing technology, each and every cloud above cricket ground can be controlled and regularly monitored. Team will be getting forecasts by IMD all around the world soon.” said a senior BCCI official when asked about all the buzz around.
Currently India are 2-0 behind in five match series. They had a dismal show with the bat at Lord’s. India were able to score only 107 and 130 in two innings of the match. Notably bowling spearhead Mohammad Shami single handedly made India cross the 100 run mark with his valiant effort with the bat. With his certificates and true age leaked back home by his wife Hasin Jahan, he certainly seemed to be only batter not missing the home conditions.",SPORTS
Players obstructing competition,"Why one sportsperson plays two games? This is so simply because of finding more scope in the choice. There has been noticed that a player playing hockey previously opts for the game of cricket. That player then snatches opportunity of another player. He definitely requires down-to-earth things in order to sustain in the sports. Thus he obstructs entry of others on the ground.
A few sportswomen played two different games at one point in time. An Australian player Elyse Alexander Perry showed her football and hockey playing dexterity. Another player Suzanna Wilson Suzie Bates from New Zealand was quite expert at doing the best in both the basketball and the cricket.
Further, Sophie Frances Monique Devine also from New Zealand played the hockey and the cricket with equal excellence. Above all, Elena Joy Tice of Ireland earned a name in the cricket and the hockey evenly. She has brought the silver medal for her team in the hockey recently.
These are some selected and glaring examples of international sportswomen skilled in two separate sports at one time. They have just achieved a position in their individual’s lives where they have also emerged as the champions in several ways.
They clearly realised it as vital enough to deserve a grand alteration in their games from one to another at one period of time. Who has not used two-camera mobiles? There are no dearths of students attaining double degrees. Actors are also regularly playing double roles in the films.
Even the double-decker buses are also not out of our queer sight. However, what surprises us most is the habit of developing an interest in two sports at the same time. For a few sportswomen at an international level, their devoted pursuit in two different games leaves us guessing what they are achieving.",SPORTS
Captain's team defeated,"Where was the captain’s team? Only Virat Kohli showed his confidence and scored a big run in both the innings. As many as three batsmen were declared at their very meagre score at the individual level. When India was aware of the fact that it had never won at Edgbaston, the players’ confidence level needed to be boosted. England may have been stunningly defeated at Edgbaston if our batsmen would have played in a more confident style. It did not look like a contest between the two cricket giants.
The English team’s winning tally was never been bad at this venue. What they had strategically designed became truly correct at the end of Edgbaston Test. We cannot avoid contributions of Indian captain Virat Kohli who played superbly well in both the innings. But the captain’s team somewhere failed to perform well. What a doomed day for our team!
As many as three players could not cross their individual tally beyond the score of 13 runs. Was it not their utter failure at the crease? It was on the seventh time that three batsmen’s individual score stayed at only thirteen runs.
More interesting than this fact was that India has not registered a win at this venue. It has lost six and drew one out of seven Test matches played at this popular ground. Pakistan and Sri Lanka have also not shown any victory in their respective eight and two Tests at the venue. How identical they are.
That was why Asian cricketers consider Edgbaston as English team’s favourite venue as they have lost merely eight matches and won a total of 28 Test matches.
Though this was not a big chase for Indian players, the swing ball demolished them. Previously, India lost chasing smaller targets of 120 in Bridgetown in 1996-97 and 176 in Galle in 2015.",SPORTS
Girls can be Arjun,"“Girls need to convince their parents that they can achieve their goals. There is nothing that women cannot do. She wanted to stand out from the crowd”, so said a determined and enthusiastic girl of Hisar in Haryana.

Getting no butter from the duck,"The hard-hitter Shikhar Dhawan departed quickly second time as the bowler beat him. This reminds us of Singh’s words, jab tak balla bolta hai, tab tak baat hoti hai. The cricketer is not finding his routine shot these days. He appeared to have fallen into some kind of unbalanced form. He did not fight as Ares himself on the ground.
He returned to the spectator area on zero in both the innings of the practice match. His twin failures in the warm-up match might make Rahul’s chance to partner Vijay stronger at the top of the batting order, as the experts analyse. Therefore, it becomes vital for him to spend some more time in the middle order.
He could not keep eye contact with the spectators anymore. He continued to stare at the real high jinks on the grassy pitch underneath his padded feet. Facing the opposite team’s fierce ball before the wicket was nothing less than standing before the enemy’s torrents of bullets like a war.
As he took a step forward from the wicket to move closer to the ball, his wicket was hit instantly. He stumbled and frozen with his feet rooted where he stood for playing the shot. Watching him made us feel as if a novice batsman getting to his feet on the crease and he surely would have growled at his utter dismal failures.
He bagged second repeated duck in a gap of just three days that was not only disappointing him badly at the present crucial situation but also sending him into complete desperation. He has failed to get the butter from the duck for the second time very much.

Cricketers to join politics now,"When we write about the success of Imran Khan in the political field, we do remember his world cup win in 1992. The subcontinental cricketers must be rejoicing at the Imran’s road to PM post. If Jemima Goldsmith had not divorced him she would have been the first lady in Pakistan now.

His thoughts must have been wandered to the yesteryears when he had established his political party in 1996. He knows he only has urged for the political life.
Now the real work before him. He should converse with the subcontinent’s cricketers as to how peace would be established in three countries and how would friendship be strengthened. The cynics might say it was his destiny to lead Pakistan. A communist leader said he was a Pathan and we should not forget Badshah Khan was also a Pathan.
But who will take the fresh initiate or bell the cat first? India appears in wait and watch mode. His political success has definitely impressed the cricket players of the India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.",SPORTS

Youths should play Kabbadi,"There is no need to sell pakoda for becoming rich as was supported by our wily politicians time and again.

That’s why he upgraded it to a 110-inch TV. He thought with his new Ultra HDTV, he will be able to read what are written when Salman Khan jumps to get those ‘taste the thunder’.

Techie uses PM Modi’s name while declaring global variable as he is a variable with global scope,"Bengaluru: Techie Prem Chander uses PM Modi’s name while declaring global variables in his software programs. This he does to make his software code complaint with the coding guidelines his organization recommends.
“I started using PM Modi’s name after I found he is a variable who is accessible to all the functions (countries) in the world not restricted to a local function like India,” said Prem working for TCS (Tara consulting services) for past seven years.
Prem had a bad habit of using arbitrary names while naming his variables or functions for which he will get noncompliance reports from his Software Quality Assurance (SQA) person.
“It does not stop there. My module lead, his boss, SQA, SQA’s assistant, our business manager, our division director, basically close to twenty odd people who spend their entire day doing stock market trading sitting inside their cozy cubicles will call me there and give me an earful for being negligent towards company’s quality policy. To teach me a lesson they gave me bad ratings and told me to attend two coding guidelines training every month,” he added.
Prem says as he has lot of respect for PM Modi, so he declares him at the top of the program.  Everything else comes below him. Prem told us he keeps Rahul Ji’s name in his code. “Not for function names as I am afraid it might not work, I keep his funny comments in my comments section. When someone reviews my code, he should not get bored”.
Prem thought his new code would meet coding guidelines, but to his surprise he got another noncompliance from SQA. SQA pointed to him, “I have no issue with Modi JI’s name for global variable, but why you have not used Rajnath Singh Ji’s name in local variable name for the Home function, that’s why you got a minor NC”.",TECHNOLOGY

Coming down hard on freshers, Facebook has blocked profiles of those who claimed they have got more than 3 lakhs package as their starting salary.
“Enough of warnings. Whatever you say, these fake news propagators are not listening to us. We are sorry, but we had no other option”, said Anshuman Jha, working as director for Facebook India.
Mr. Jha added, “These freshers forget we have AI to track the fake news immediately. Freshers salary of 3 lakh per annum is so obvious, who does not know about it. No one will believe if you say a different figure”
Facebook is not closing the doors on the freshers who after all belongs to the most active users pool of its platform.
“If the freshers can submit salary proof attested by company, we will unblock them. It has been more than 3 days, not a single person has uploaded details. You can imagine, what was happening in our platform”, said Mr. Jha.
Many freshers who joined organizations in last 2 weeks and are on the verge of getting promoted to ‘bench’ are livid with Facebook.
One such fresher Manish Gupta told us, “Now, how I will manage mandatory six hours at office without access to Facebook. My company has also not made any alternate arrangement”.
“Yesterday, I tried to kill my time by sending Good Morning/Evening messages with nice pictures in sixty WhatsApp groups I am a member. Thirty of them removed me.

Due to Instagram crash IT company delivers project three days in advance,"Bengaluru: It’s not only the android phone users, Instagram crash has affected many.

“No one is happy. The client-side project manager called me today to show their displeasure. They are asking me why we delivered the project ahead of time, he does not have a team to test it”, said Pradeep Kombettu, project manager of TCS.
Pradeep added, “We have to take the blame. My team is known for doing the work in sixty days that can be done in ten days. Even when we gave the delivery date as March end, customer will have its team ready to test our software package by May end only. After yesterday’s mishap went through the check-in list. My guess was correct, the active users of Instagram who have spent hours ogling at Alia Bhat, Katrina Kaif posts have spent their time doing project work during Instagram downtime”.
“During code reviews I have made it a mandatory checklist for reviewers to verify for a single line of code, there has to be at least ten lines of social media messages. Assuming that I prepare the project plan and bill customers. If we deliver like this ahead of time, the company would lose business and ultimately it would affect us all”, said Pradeep who has been asked to apologize to client and take steps to avoid this in future.
Pradeep has added ‘social media down time’ under risk item and is working on a mitigation plan to keep the team engaged somewhere else till social media services are restored back.

Person books 2 more cabs to reach the location where the driver of the originally booked cab was waiting,"With great technology comes great burden. Don’t know who said it but it is a reality. The online Taxi applications have made life easy but at the same time given us lot of headaches. Have you ever got a taxi at the exact location where you want it without the driver calling you even once? If yes then you are lucky. If no then you belong to the majority. Drivers find it hard to come to the exact location even with the help of google maps and other sophisticated location tracking technology.
Sanil Jain, an entrepreneur from Mumbai, who has made Uber taxis his office, to save the cost of renting a office space, regularly books 10-12 Ubers a day and works inside the taxis.  But most of the time he spends 15-20 minutes on a call with the driver to explain his exact location. So that comes out to be 150-200 minutes per day. That’s a huge amount of time in an entrepreneur’s life. But what happened today was historic. Sanil booked two more cabs to reach the location of the originally booked cab. So the total time he took to reach the originally booked cab = (15 + 15 +15 ) = 45 minutes.
This is a historic occasion and many people will start using it after this success story. Even Uber is soon starting the shuttle service to make you reach the originally booked Uber. This will also save the cost of developing a technology which would help a person reach easily to the location where his original cab is waiting.

Leak all our data to companies but don’t show our ex when we visit their profiles- Indians to Zuckerberg,"New Delhi: Social media giant Facebook is under a lot of fire these days over the data leak issue. Apparently, data of over 50 Million profiles was leaked to data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica who used this data to run political campaigns in US and UK over the past 2 years. The issue is also getting a lot of attention in India as well as they were allegedly working with Indian political parties as well. However, average Indian parties have another concern when it comes to their Facebook data.
Several Indian youngsters have requested Facebook to avoid showing their exes when they visit their profiles. Visiting Facebook profile of an ex in the hope of them getting uglier with time is a favourite timepass among Indian youth, an activity that almost automatically happens after having more than 4 pegs. With Facebook data proving to be not as private as one hoped, these youngsters are now worried that their exes will be able to see their profile visits one day.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, an FB user from Delhi said,”It is fine if they share our data with some data analytics company. They can target us with political messages but the joke will be on them, since most of the social media generation doesn’t vote in the first place. Real worry is if the data starts getting leaked to individuals and Priya starts getting a notification every time I visit her profile hoping she has lost hair or put on a 100 Kgs.”
Another user from Mumbai said ,”I regularly visit my ex’s profile to check if she is still single to make sure I still have a chance but if she comes to know about my twice a day profile visits, all my chances will be gone. She will think I am a creepy stalker which I am definitely not!”

Scientists develop special vision red goggles will help people to be able to see their friends who vanished after taking money ,"Have you ever given money to friends or loaned some cash to relatives and never saw them again? If you have, then what scientists at AAAS have done will ensure you longer have to hunt them.
The scientists at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) have developed special vision red goggles; the ones that will help people to be able to see their friends who have vanished after taking their money.
The recent innovation was made public at a press conference organized in Chicago. The head of AAAS, Mr. Ronald Grump, demonstrated the features of the invention.
The team behind the development of this innovation was led by Mr. Kundar Pichai, an Indian-origin American. He said, “I was born and brought up in India. I shifted to U.S. 10 years ago. Even though I got out of India, India didn’t get out of me. I still remember every small trait that Indians possess. Back when I was studying at an engineering college in Mumbai, there were many instances when I loaned money to my friends either for a cigarette or for a date and many other reasons. And whenever I wanted the money back, I just couldn’t find them. It was like every time they just vanished. Last year, when I was talking to my son who’s studying in the same engineering college in Mumbai, he told me he’s experiencing the same problem that I and many other guys have faced. I decided that I need to do something to end this problem, using my skills and expertise. I was thinking about it sitting on my couch and watching Mr. India and that’s when this idea struck me.”
He further explained the product features, “Let me show how this works. As a volunteer, we asked one of our team members stationed in India, Mr. Gupta to lend money to a colleague who was asking him since a long time. He was reluctant to give him money because the last time he had lent the money, he was just not able to see or find him anywhere. We convinced Mr. Gupta to do the same again and use our product. So he lent him money for a month and at the time of recovering money, he used our product. He put on our goggles; roamed in his office as well as nearby areas and he found his colleague in the cafeteria.”
He showed the video demonstration, “As you can see there is a camera fitted on the top of the goggles. When Mr. Gupta removes the goggles, we aren’t able to see the colleague. When he puts them back on the colleague is visible. In the next update, we will also install GPS and sensors, which will enable users to trace them at their exact location and get notifications about the same.”
The product prototype is first going to be tested in the Indian market in the first week of March. We hope that the testing is successful and the product is fully launched so that we can avail the benefits of this product that has been tentatively named Finding Money.”",TECHNOLOGY
New Food delivery app using AI delivers food 30 minutes before one realize he is hungry,"Bengaluru: New food delivery app Wiggy delivers food at least 30 minutes before the person will realize he is hungry. Wiggy, which is revolutionizing the food delivery market says it is able to do so because it is first app in this segment that uses Artificial Intelligence.
While talking to us Wiggy founder, Sharat Kumar said, “Our logic is simple. No one knows when he or she will be hungry. Once you are hungry, you have to place order, then we will take another 30 minutes to deliver food. That’s a lot of time. Not many can control their hunger for so much time.”
Mr. Kumar added, “So, what we use is called big data mining. We know the behavior of the person, what he does throughout the day. In addition, we know outside climate, person’s eating pattern, what kind of food person likes. It’s a complex algorithm at work. We use it to deliver food in advance at people’s doorsteps. Good percentage of cases people accepted what we delivered and they have given positive feedback.”
When we asked what about food that people might not accept, Mr. Kumar added, “Our delivery boys take these food parcels and shout in front of hostels. Hostel ka food itna tasty hota hai ki, sab bhuke rehte hain dinvar. Jo bhi unko do, hostel students kha lete hain. Budget is a constraint for them. As they are our future customers, we give good discount to them”.
Manish Yadav, an engineering student who does not remember when was the last time he attended classes, said, “Yeh sab to theek hai. After Netflix has come, I am very busy. So much food lying here goes waste. We need a new app, which should send someone to arrange food in a plate and feed us when we would be watching our shows”.
Sharat from Wiggy said, “We are working on a new app called feedubaby which will do exactly what Manish wants.”",TECHNOLOGY

Whenever I invented a breakthrough product, I used to get mails and messages from my friends in India requesting me to innovate something for the Indian market. One day I was talking with a close friend from India on Skype and we were discussing, rather debating about a topic in aerospace engineering and then he had to leave because his relatives had arrived unexpectedly. I got a little vexed because I was winning. This is when it struck me that I should develop an escape pod for the Indian market that would help Indians avoid relatives whenever they want to. Yes I know the thought process escalated quickly but this is how I get most of my ideas.” Explaining about the product he added “The escape pod has been named Phir Se Ud Chala. The name was finalized after a lot of deliberation and research. This is how it works – When you realize a relative has arrived unexpectedly, all you need to do is sit on the pod and press one of the three buttons – Roam Around, Escape and Save My Life, depending on how badly you want to avoid the relative. The escape pod is enabled with collision sensors, GPS navigations, WiFi, charging input as well a display screen. All you need to do is just press a button and fly away. You can also set the duration for which you need to be away from your home, at the end of which the pod will bring you back to your home.”
This was when a reporter asked him for his views on the performance of current government. Unable to understand the relevance of the question, Elon Musk sat on the pod, pressed the Save My Life button and flew away.",TECHNOLOGY
Man blocks promotional texts from Ola Ola CEO visits house with new offers ,"The Ola mobile application is being downloaded by an increasing number of people to get notifications about the attractive offers that the cab giant provides in every city, except the one the user lives in.
Many people have resorted to uninstalling the application in order to avoid getting disturbed while sleeping, taking a dump, travelling in an Uber, etc.
The mobile application, which sends notifications day in and out, was recently uninstalled by a Mumbai man after he got frustrated by the streak of promotional SMSes from Ola.
However, uninstalling the application did not give him any respite as the Ola CEO himself showed up at his house with promotional offers. “They would send me an SMS asking if I ‘want to ride back home’ when I was already home, and an SMS asking if I ‘want to reach office’ when I was already in the office,” said the man.
Frustrated, the man uninstalled the application only to find the Ola CEO at his doorstep the next day. “As soon as I opened the door, he started reciting all the promotional SMSes. He then requested me to book him an Uber cab so he can return home,” said the horrified man.
“I downloaded the Ola application so I can use it as the alarm. Forget waking me up at the right time, the notifications never allowed me to sleep in the first place. I got depressed and also lost my job,” said another man, who claims to have joined Ola as a driver after losing his job.
Ola drivers are lately considered notorious for cancelling rides at the last minute. “Next time around, I’ll uninstall the application and reinstall it just before the CEO arrives. That’s how Ola drivers cancel rides—at the last minute,” said another Mumbai-based user of the mobile application.",TECHNOLOGY

New app launched to inform what needs to be linked with Aadhaar before which deadline,"New Delhi: Government of India has launched a new app which would help people to know what needs to be linked with Aadhaar before which deadline. Unique Identification Authority of India (UIADI) which comes under the supervision of central government has launched the new app for Android, iOS as well as Windows devices.
While speaking to us, UIADI CEO, A.K. Pandey said, “It is humanly impossible to remember what all one needs to do to become cent percent Aadhaar complaint. I am doing it diligently for me and my family members for last four months, still there are so many checklists pending for us. Can understand the pain of my fellow Indians who must be getting a dozen smses everyday informing what all you need to link with Aadhaar.”
While giving us a demo of the app, Mr. Pandey said, “Click on one date, say Dec 31st, 2017, you will see what all you must link before that date like bank account, Mutual fund holdings, Pan Card, blah, blah, blah. Similarly, if you click on another date, say, Feb 6th, 2018, you will see a tab saying you have to link your mobile sim card before this date. There is a long list of items one needs to do as of today. Then Aadhaar linking is a never-ending process, time to time we will be keep on adding new items to the list”.
On the benefits of Aadhaar, Mr. Pandey said, “Long list of benefits already mentioned in UIADI website. If that is not sufficient, regularly listen to ‘mann ki baat’ and from time to time Jaitley Ji speaks on ‘cess ki baat’ where he and his finance ministry colleagues talk about Aadhaar benefits.”
As expected like any Government app, this app also crashed within minutes. People are hoping as deadline comes close many websites that demand Aadhaar linking will crash due to overloading which will compel Government to move the deadlines.

A company develops ‘Aadhaar enabled chip’ which will say who are around you in Delhi smog,"New Delhi: Gurgaon based semiconductor firm Toxic Technologies India Private Limited has developed a new chip which can inform a person who are around you. This chip has been developed to help people in Delhi and NCR region where it is becoming extremely difficult to know who is standing just 30 centimeters from you.
While giving us some details on the new chip, Mr. Vinod Ahuja, CEO of Toxic technologies said, “One can fit our customized kit on top of a cap, on your shirt button or on top a wrist band. Our customized software kit contains a chip, sensor and a small speaker. Sensor will sense who are around you in 2-meter radius. Chip basically contains everyone’s Aadhaar card details, so if your wife is near you, it will announce through the tiny speaker her name as present in Aadhaar data base”.
Mr. Ahuja shared some details on another advanced product they are going to launch soon. “Looking at the pollution level here, we feel after few days people won’t be able to see even their own hands, legs and feet. So, we will suggest people to wear multiple devices on various parts of their body. There would be a ‘master’ speaker which would say that’s your hand, that’s your leg etc.”, Mr. Ahuja said.
We spoke to Mr. Manoj Agarwal, who was standing in front of a shop in Gurgaon selling Toxic’s products. He said, “I am going to buy a dozen of them. How long inside our own home we would stretch our hands while moving around, touch each other’s face to know who is next to you?”
“Yesterday when asked my son to study, he says he cannot as font size in books are too small. Idhar school bandh hai, pura din mobile mein games khel raha tha.

Facebook re-introduces marking “I am safe” for Delhi people,"Delhi’s smog problem is grabbing headlines all over the world. From BBC to WHO, everyone has shifted focus from finding flaws in Donald Trump’s policies to finding solutions to Delhi’s smog problem. And when it’s the whole world involved then how can a new social media country be left behind? Yes, you guessed it right. Facebook on Wednesday introduced its famous ‘I am safe’ button for all those who are stuck in Delhi fighting the thick smog.
Delhi’s smog is worsening by the day. There is no sign of it getting subsided. People all over the world are scared about their friends and relatives stuck up in such a hazardous environment.
So to make them aware of Delhites’ wellbeing, Facebook has launched its ‘I am safe’ button so that people can mark themselves safe and make their relatives all over the world feel relieved. We talked to Mark Zuckerberg about this feature and he said, “Every time there is a crisis in any part of the globe, Facebook launches that button so that people can mark themselves safe. Although, Indians mark themselves safe even when they are not there in that crisis. Like once I saw a Delhi guy marking himself safe during the London Bomb Blasts while sitting in New Delhi. So, as soon as the smog crisis occurred in Delhi, we received lakhs of emails in our inbox asking to create a mark safe option for Delhi smog also. And I cannot disappoint them.”
We talked to a few Delhi based students on this new feature of Marking Safe. One of them, Siddharth Arora, said, “I always marked myself safe in every crisis situation in the world even if I was sitting at home. Thank god and thanks to the pollution, now I can legitimately mark myself safe on Facebook.”
That’s not all. The Delhi CM has called this as a victory of Aam Aadmi Party. In his tweet, he said, “Delhi is thankful to Mark Zuckerberg for introducing ‘I am safe’ button for all the Delhites. Today Aam Aadmi has won again”. Though people trolled him and said, “We wanted to mark ourselves safe but you didn’t provide free wifi to us”.",TECHNOLOGY
"IT engineer goes to office as per company wish, but comes back as per his manager wish","Bengaluru: IT engineer Prakash Hegde like most of his colleagues in IT city has ‘flexible’ working hours. The flexibility has a strong correlation with his manager’s wish what time he should leave for the day including holidays and weekends.
“I do not know how many of my colleagues have gone through the HR policy which clearly stated working hour is from 9 AM to 5:30 PM. Little I knew this will another HR policy like many other HR policies will not be followed neither in letter or spirit in the organization”, said Prakash whose day’s typically starts around 9 AM and ends somewhere close to midnight.
Prakash added, “Like every advertisement has a *Conditions apply. Our HR policy also stated sometimes to meet stringent delivery dates customers will want us to meet, employees would be asked to stretch beyond their ‘normal’ working hours. These ‘sometimes’ has now stretched little more than two years for me”.
“IT’s not that every single day customer demands deliverables. My manager who has the uncanny ability of remembering what needs to be done just before end of day. Another good quality he has, he will not force me or my other team members to deliver before end of day which means before next day sunrise happens. He will just say, ‘Guys let’s see what best we can do tonight’ before he leaves for the day”.
“Initially I left early and it showed in my appraisal grades. Then I understood ‘try your best’ means deliver at any cost. Otherwise be ready to be in the firing line”, said Prakash.
Prakash has some kind words for his manager. He said, “My manager is not that bad. He understands in weekends and public holidays he cannot force us to stay that longer. His ‘humane’ side comes in to picture and encourages us to live our live to the fullest when we do not work. I am writing a book, have titled it ‘working from bus & working for boss’ which is a tribute to the  traffic and my manager which dictated the kind of life style I have got in this IT city”.",TECHNOLOGY
Teleportation-An old but new concept of time & space,"We all know about Narad muni. He travels from one heavenly body to the other in fraction of seconds. This is because, he may be using a time machine. Such a concept of time travel or teleportation is present in Vedas. Therefore, let us say, “Teleportation is the transfer of matter or energy. Transfer from one point to another at a long distance.” Thus, Teleportation is a peculiar phenomenon.In such a process, a person can travel a great distance in fraction of seconds.
The well-known scientist.
Heisenberg says “Quantum theory will not look ridiculous to people who have read Vedanta.” Neil Bohr statement- “I go into the Upanishads to ask questions.”
Upanishads, Vedas and Bhagwat-Gita
‘Siddhis” are spiritual and supernatural abilities. Rishis acquires them by mediation & yoga. Thus, they acquires power to control time and space. They also can transform the body. Therefore, they travel great distances in fraction of seconds.
The present research.
A pair of particles in the same quantum state ( same wave functions) interacts.Thus they  are entangled. Quantum entanglement   means connectedness.  Thus,the “Chetna” of both the particles is connected. Now, we separate the particles by thousands of kilometers. If we change the property of one particle, say “A”. The other, “B” experience the same change. Therefore, “A” can act as the teleporter & “B” as receiver.
The Indian scientist designs an instrument.
Teleporter break down the body into minute particles. Whereas, receiver re-materialize the body at great distances. This instrument is  also an amalgamation.A mixture of Indian meditation technique & recent engineering.
Meeting with Prime minister.
The Prime minister says. “keep the research secrete for twenty years.”   This is because of certain socioeconomic problems.  There is an agreement. Prime minister only can use the instrument. Therefore, he teleports himself to America & China & Russia & to any country of the world. But, only for the benefit of Indian people.
After 20 years.
India is now the super power. India is now world guru. It is now a hub for artificial intelligence. Hub for robotics & teleportation. Now, Modi Sahib retires from politics. He says, beam me up to Himalayas. Thus, the machine teleports him there. He starts meditation.",TECHNOLOGY
Facebook announces Sanskari dating feature in India,"Back in May Facebook announced that that it will soon let its users create a dating profile to meet non-friends who have also opted in for its dating features. And since Facebook knows more about you than your mother or your ex-girlfriend. Facebook will match slew of your preferences to help you find the one, for you to date. Here is how Facebook dating feature might look like as published on the TechCrunch website:
Opt-in to a create a profile with just your first name. Your profile won’t be visible to friends, users who aren’t on the dating feature, and it won’t show up in the News Feed.
You’ll browse Events in your city and Groups that match your interests. You can select to “unlock” one for dating. You’ll then see the profiles of other dating users who’ve unlocked that surface.
You can browse through people’s profiles that show off a few of their photos plus some basic information about them. You’ll be shown people based on mutual interests and friends, plus other data Facebook has on you.
If you both are interested, you’ll be able to start a conversation with someone in a special inbox that’s separate from Messenger and WhatsApp. For safety, only text can be sent for now.
This works all well and good in parts of the world where dating is considered normal. In India however, things are different and Facebook knows it. To carter to Sanskari culture of Indian sub-continent, Facebook will be rolling out several additional features.
“We respect the culture and traditions of the given country, and hence it is our responsibility to adapt our services to culture, rather than trying to modernize it,” said Zuck while talking about the possible introduction of it’s dating feature for India.
“Our goal is not to imitate Tinder, we are trying to build a dating feature that is socially accepted by young and old alike. We want to help people build relationships that last longer than a couple of dates.” said a Facebook spokesperson when asked if Facebook is trying to poach Tinder in India. So here is a list of additional features on top of the aforementioned five points that would be introduced specially for India:
You will have to submit your Adhar Card to validate your identity before you can sign-up for the dating feature on Facebook.
Your parents will be required to approve you before your dating profile goes online. Furthermore, they will be able to ask for a second opinion from a close relative.
If your parents do not approve of inter-caste marriages, you will be required to upload your caste certificate. You’ll only be shown people who have opted for dating feature from your caste.
There will be a special ‘filter bride/groom by salary‘ feature alongside ‘occupation‘ filter. ‘We have taken inspiration from answers on Quora, thus we know how important these things are for dating/marriages in India’, said Facebook spokesperson while explaining the importance of ‘can/can’t cook‘ filter for women.
There will be an option to match the Kundli. ‘We know more about your preferences than your ex-girlfriend knew about you. We have designed algorithms that can predict the probability of the relationship working out or not in long term. But that is all useless if your Kundlis do not match.’ the Facebook spokesperson explained further on Kundli feature.
Once you select your potential match, parents of both party will have to approve on respective choices before you can interact with each other.
With Tinder is hugely unpopular among Indian parents. Seems like Facebook is focused on keeping Indian parents happy when it comes to their children’s dating life. Facebook seems to have decoded the mantra of India’s dating culture, ‘The secret to a happy relationship is when all your relatives are happy with your choice’.
P.S.: The sarcasm is not to be mistaken for criticism. It is the viewpoint of the author which you can disagree with. This post was not written to offend anyone. While Facebook has announced it’s dating feature, everything being said in this post about its introduction in India is fictional.

Profits from Dragonfly – communist version of Google in China will be used to promote ‘Human Rights’,"Amidst uproar in the ranks of its own employees, the tech giant Google released a statement that half of its profits earned from ‘dragonfly’ would be spent on charitable causes. Dragonfly is the name of search engine built by Google exclusively for China. This new search engine was tailor made to the specifications dictated by the ‘Techno-Proletariat’ the subcommittee that oversees online censorship.
In a special presentation that would be shared to employees, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google was seen explaining the reasons behind why Google chose to work with China. The text was released to media verbatim.
The Statement
“Yes! We went back. We went back on our decision. On the decision of not subjecting our beloved ‘Google’ to the obstinate censorship laws of Mandarin. But, there is another angle to it. From another perception, one can say, we have saved Google from even being used by the Chinese. True, Dragonfly is also our search engine – a product of Alphabet. But, it is not Google. For Google can never be subjected to censorship laws”, Pichai was seen emotionally speaking and vehemently supporting the decision of working with China.
“Well, being a self-proclaimed Communist state, China practices Capitalism more openly. On the other hand, America, the symbol of Capitalistic society is riddled with socialist policies where everyone depends on the government for social security. If we use migrants and blacks for target practice, for lack of diversified resources, China had to use their own people – and this specific act is seen by us as an inhuman activity” he reasoned out.
“For seven years… Seven long years, we have not worked with China. What purpose it did serve? Nothing. We lost seven years of revenue. And, fed up with our adamant attitude, China decided simply to make a Chinese version of Google. All that we could do was to cry a lot about copy right violations, had they made a Chinese search engine. We can certainly file suits and enter litigations and continuous arbitrations. But in the end, only Google would be the loser”.
“It was hence decided to give the Chinese what they want. After all, the Chinese government represents the authority of Sovereign Republic of China. And, the technical work that had gone into making ‘dragonfly’ was simply propping up few firewalls to filter out the content prohibited within the Great Wall. We know how annoyed our employees will be. So, we would like to use half of the income generated by the dragonfly on supporting human rights in United States, Israel and India. One may well ask why spend in countries that are free. Alphabet is a forward looking organisation and would like the free countries remain free. Moreover, this charity spend can be leveraged to improve our influence in these countries to increase our presence. After all, it is easier to influence free and capitalist societies.”
Footnotes
When one reporter asked Pichai that his statement raises many questions rather than answering questions asked, he laughed like a magician and said “I know that you don’t know even what to ask because you don’t even know that I know of any answers”. He patted the bewildered reporter and said soothingly “Don’t worry. Chinese government wanted to invite few journalists from America to witness and report on the performance of ‘dragonfly’. I suggest you to visit the Forbidden City and experience the dragon err… dragonfly. On your return, I will be more than happy to answer all your questions”. He sounded so confident, the reporter feared for his life and refused the offer then and there itself.

"Shirish Kunder’s Alien, abduct Tesla Roadster in Space","Washington DC: NASA has officially confirmed the hijacking of Elon Musk’s Tesla in space on its official website.
Starting this year, Elon Musk’s SpaceX launched a Tesla Car into space. While its officially confirmed that aliens from Shirish Kunder’s film ‘JOKER’ have seized the car but its exact location is not even traceable by NASA.
Interstellar director Christopher Nolan was sent as a good will ambassador from NASA to negotiate with the ace young age filmmaker Shirish Kunder but the dialogue failed when Shah Rukh Khan intervened inbetween who has ZERO knowledge about space and universe. But before leaving back to Hollywood, Nolan had an opportunity to catch up Shirish over his science fiction film ‘JOKER’ and appreciated his innovative ideas on film making.
Fakingnews reporter Geethanjali interviewed Shirish. Speaking to faking news, he said, “Life cannot be just about solving one sad problem after another from monday blues to no clues. There needs to be adventure and spice in life and universe inspires me. My alien friends have colonized space. Black holes are nothing but entry to aliens home, just like the igloos of snow which have a passage to enter the mini snow house, black holes are nothing but entrance to aliens kingdom.”
“I am glad, I wake up in the morning and interact with these aliens via Twitter. When I was a kid, I spent long hours thinking about space. Yes, its true that Tesla Roadster Car is being abducted but I support aliens, since they have saved the Tesla car from entering the black holes.”
“I feel sending a mannequin as a driver is not a wise decision. Many female aliens had started to flirt with him on ‘Aliens Tinder Dating App’. The dummy was so much in love with female aliens that he forgot about his space mission and was about to enter the aliens home to make babies and colonise Mars. Male aliens were envy of him as female aliens would prefer dummy human for date over them. This was the only solution and we managed to kidnap and shall get back the car on earth along with the dummy driver.”
“TESLA in space is now phrased as T:Tesla’s E:Elon S:Seduces L:Lovely A:Aliens. It is the sexiest car in cosmos and lady aliens enjoy the starry night car rides along with the dummy human.”
“I too have travelled in my white Mercedes many occasions to meet aliens in space but I don’t date anyone in space inspite of having many female fan followers in space too. We party in space with Chicken Tandoori and Kingfisher Strong Beer watching Stars and Moon. I shall start my first space film shoot on Moon this month and there after second schedule is fixed on Mars in May. I am short listing even aliens for my next science fiction film. Female Aliens are a huge fan of Ranbir Kapoor while males love Angelina Jolie. I show them films on my laptop. Aliens are constructing a cinema hall on Moon and it shall be inaugurated this year with my space film. My launch pad to space is at the Mangalore beach.”
Shirish further advised NASA and Elon – “DONOT PANIC”, since the car shall land safely along with dummy man on earth at the Central Park in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai on 4th April’ 2018.
We enquired more about his hidden secret life and space activities, to which Shirish replied, “Sometimes being alien is the only option.”

Apple launching new iPhone XI with Kerosene support,"Apple is going to launch a iPhone named as iPhone XI. The main highlight of the device (which was leaked from a anonymous site) will be performance.
The new iPhone would use kerosene in combination with lithium ion battery to perform better. One of the spokeperson of Apple said- It took us 5 years to turn this technology into RealityKings. This will further enhance the capacity of the Iphone’s Multitasking and some of our most revolutionary features which are least used like faceID, Animoji.
As they used to consume a lots of battery. When the phones battery is low it would automatically shift to kerosene. On kerosene it would make sounds like a stove which would make people around them calm. The people would have to buy a five liter revolutionary iKerosene tank to store it. Further to carry it revolutionary ikerosene tank apple has designed a ibagpack taking into considerations of the consumers.
In a tie with Govt of india, for making the availability of kerosene, Both GOI and Apple have reached to a single decision of- The kerosene for apple phones would be available at local public distribution shop and you should have a yellow card to buy kerosene. The terms of conditions would be decided by GOI: Every person having income lower than Rs 10000/- would be able to get yellow card. They have to apply to local RSS office to get approval for Yellow card issuance.Every person having in possession of yellow card who isn’t real beneficiary for that card would be given a latest macbook for half of the price but person himself has to buy its accessories.
Apple said in official statement: Its the new strategy of apple which has nothing to do with the strategy of removing 3.5 mm jack. And compelling people to buy a iphone for rs 100k and then buy airpods for rs 23k. Which further has nothing to do with the strategy of removing USB port and CD drive from its MACBOOK latest editions
On a question asked by journist from Timepass news which was- Where do you get all these ideas? we took this idea from Mr. BIRBAL (who was visiting to apple headquarters to find some answers for questions asked by Mr. AKBAR around 800 years ago)
The Iphone XI would be prices at Rs 1,29,998/-
The Ikerosene tank would be priced at Rs 2,00,000/-

Rockets could be better for timely trip!,"KANPUR: Do we not grasp an idea of the day when there will start the rockets to take us? These will go through the roof or go sky-high to avoid wastage of time. Though the rocket science is often referred informally in our conversation, there needs to be deep thinking on making this science useful for the purpose of transportation.
Not only the time will be saved but the passengers will also experience in a way that feels like foreshadowing.
This alteration in transport may facilitate the passengers to end the war of words and the authorities concerned herewith would be saved from finding excuses in a staggered manner.
The air passengers were recently blatantly annoyed; everyone can suffer it, apart from the non-passengers. As many as 270 passengers of the Air India Mumbai-Ahmadabad flight created a rumpus at CS International airport following the delayed flight of close to seven hours. The delay was owing to non-availability of the pilot for the aircraft. The flight departure was due at 1.35 a.m. past midnight but it could take off at 08.20 a.m. on Saturday morning.
What a time has come! Since technological advancement has reached a very higher level, the traffic system still seems unarranged as it should practically be.
Modes of transportation continue to be revolutionized but its operational dexterity has not been gained.
The common passengers find the bus service inefficient, the rail service delayed and now the air service hopeless too. Faster means of moving, carrying, flying and shipping are not proving perfect in its functional form.

Be online for further casual chat,"KANPUR: All the guests were full of beans at the party as they were talking, dancing and sipping coffee. None of them was really interested in leaving the place amid complete enjoyments. But the time came to depart and everyone moved away by and by. This life is different from the time when people used to inquire about one another’s well-being.  Now, the emphasis remains upon being online because this has been considered quite a humane way to converse.
Then, elders delighted in blessing the youngsters by saying, ‘God bless you.’ But presently we come across the oft-repeated term ‘be online for further conversation’. Every hand carries a mobile set which is featured with latest techniques. The habit has changed with the arrival of this electronic gadget in our lives. We feel elated at providing our mobile numbers to one and all as it facilitates easy exchange of talk between two persons or among several persons.

The clergy class bless us with the sentence, “May God keep everyone online.” There is a fashion in these things. At the moment this is a satisfactory manner for all the mobile users.

The staff realised the grave mistake and worked out a plan of timely correction of the erroneous shift in the direction. The train which was to move for Lucknow was on the track leading towards Allahabad. The train was directed to reach older British days’ capital rather to present-day capital.
Sooner the mistake was corrected by calling back the train after blocking that route. This was a firmly clear case of off the beam signalling. We were used to listening about the people boarding the wrong train. Due to lack of proper information about the trains the people committed this sort of mistake. When they learnt of wrong boarding it was too late. They had to get off the train at another platform. Some even followed chain pulling or jumping off the slow-moving train. They resorted to such risky method simply because of the fact that the train could not be brought back.
However, the recent occurrence proved of the train’s redirection on the backward station. If that train would not have been redirected to Kanpur Central there was no technique to send it to Lucknow. Ultimately the passengers had to face the brunt of the railways’ inaccuracies. The trains become late for hours. Was it not an aberration of serious nature? Movement of the trains depends completely on the signalling system. This was the case of route re-direction. It was not layman’s fault but the railways’ experienced hands did this type of blunder. What remained a matter of satisfaction was grabbing the inaccuracy within time.",TECHNOLOGY
Phones refuse to let go of user's hands after prolonged use- Study,"In a latest study on smartphones, it has been revealed that people using one for the longest time will not be able to separate it from their hands. Some youngsters feel it’s a good thing.
iAbbey, an 18-year old, says, “Thank god, we’ll never have to spend time looking around for phones for they’ll never be lost. It would be a deterrent for phone thieves as well.” On the contrary, Samson says, “How would I be ever able to change my phone¿” We also spoke to his mother who was shocked to hear this. She said, “Probably that’s how robots got created.”
Some think it could also be the case of phones developing human-like emotions after being bombarded with emoticons every day, so they refuse to let go of the user. An Indian researcher has suggested changing the term “handset”.
A major adhesive firm has already started research on this, looking for some inspiration.",TECHNOLOGY

The 30 year old business man from Mira Road, who is a regularly commutes by local train, asked for a single buttock in his next birth in his prayers. The reason for this unique request was to enable him to sit as the fourth passenger on a local train seat meant for three.

Leaving me with that uncomfortable fourth seat, where one of my buttock in left hanging without support. By the end of the day I am left with one sore butt. So my only prayer to the almighty is to give me just one buttock.”
Hiren’s request struck a chord with many other passengers who have been braving heavy rush in local trains for all these years. A city based cosmetic surgeon even offered to surgically remove one of Hiren’s buttock free of charge. “Why wait for the next birth. I will help this man in this life itself,” said the doctor.

Woman who shifted from Delhi to Mumbai gains 5kgs in 5 days after not having to run due to eve teasing,"Mumbai: As compared to Mumbai and Kolkata where citizens sharply react to any incident of molestation or eve-teasing, such reactions are totally lacking or missing on the part of citizens of Delhi who have a vital role to play in preventing harassment to the women traveling in the city. A live example has come to our notice yesterday.
A woman, who had shifted from Delhi to Mumbai a few days back due to work commitments found out that she had gained 5 kgs in 5 days without even changing any dietary habits or any weather conditions.
Priyanka Ranaut, who works for an MNC shifted to Mumbai 5 days back. And in those 5 days, she never ran away due to any eve teaser harassing her, which was quite common in Delhi. But that scenario had created havoc in her personal life. Gaining 5 kgs in 5 days, she doesn’t where will it all stop.
If the same situation continues, she might gain a lot of weight which will be fatal to health. Many Gyms across the city have sent her their brochure of losing weight in a 30-day challenge or cashback offers.
The Maharashtra government is using this news to boast about the good law and order situation in Mumbai and has promised that to deal with issues which priyanka had to face, the government will subsidize Gym expenditures every month for women.",TECHNOLOGY
'Just trying to fit into Delhi culture by brandishing gun' says ex-BSP MP's son over accusation,"Putting across his side of the story, ex- BSP MPs son Ashish Pandey admitted that he did brandish a gun as seen in the video but it was done to fit into the typical Delhi culture.
While elaborating on the ‘typical Delhi culture’, he said, “It’s a Delhi thing you know. When ‘tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai’ doesn’t work then you whip out your gun. It’s done as a scare tactic and no to actually shoot someone.”
“I am from Lucknow and even fights over there done with tehzeeb. I would be treated like an outcast if I tried that in Delhi. So I had to carry a gun and a baseball bat in my car to just to show that I am part of Delhi’s high society,” he added.
South Delhi businessman SK Khurana, though hesitant initially, did agree that these things are common in Delhi and media shouldn’t overreact. “Why is that Arnab behaving like a rabid mongrel over this issue. If he hadn’t brandished the weapon then it would have been a national crisis,” he said.
“I remember once I had an argument with a man after he cut me in traffic. We were talking like gentlemen and sorting the issue when some bystanders got restless and asked when are we going to start fighting. They were not happy with our politeness and wanted to hear some cuss words,” he recollected.
A senior bureaucrat, while commenting in the incident said that people coming from outside should respect the culture of Delhi. “Please liberally flaunt your political connections. Invest in a gun if you can afford it, especially the high society types. Carry a baseball bat in you car to start a road rage without provocation. In fact car dealers should give baseball bats as standard accessory,” he suggested.",TECHNOLOGY

As per old traditions and customs, Hindus clean their houses before Diwali celebrations and by the time of Dhanteras, they ensure that every corner is spick and span.   The reason behind this is that on this day, it is believed that Goddess Laxmi takes shelter in people’s homes. ""Dhan"" in Sanskrit means wealth.   Dhanteras is considered as an extremely auspicious day to make new purchases, especially gold or silver articles and new utensils. It is believed that new ""Dhan"" (wealth) or some form of precious metal signifies good luck and these new purchase is said to ensure the inflow of both wealth and luck throughout the year.   Nowadays, it is common for people to make other kinds of purchases such as automobiles or TV, refrigerators etc. This is why all major stores and outlets have so many lucrative discounts on Dhanteras.   There are many legends and folklores associated with the ritual of buying new utensils and jewellery.   According to one such myth, King Hima's daughter-in-law saved his son from the god of death Yamraj who had appeared in the disguise of a snake.   She prevented him from entering the room by placing a heap of gold jewellery and silver coins along with lots of diyas at the door. The glittering jewellery and the bright diyas blinded him and he returned without the King's son who was destined to die on the fourth day of his marriage. Similarly, buying gold and silver jewellery or new utensils is said to protect you against ill luck and is said to be the harbinger of prosperity.   On this day, people worship Goddess Laxmi and Lord Kuber by singing bhajans or devotional songs. In Maharashtra, Naivedya of traditional sweets is offered to the Goddess.  ",INDIA
Soldier's Wife Delivers Baby Hours Before Husband's Cremation in J&K ,"Banihal/Jammu: Just hours before the mortal remains of Lance Naik Ranjeet Singh were consigned to flames at his ancestral village in Ramban district of Jammu and Kashmir Tuesday, his wife delivered a baby girl — the first child of the couple after a wait of 10 years.   The soldier was among the three personnel of Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry who fell to the bullets of Pakistani intruders along the Line of Control (LoC) in Sunderbani sector of Rajouri district on Sunday.   Two heavily-armed Pakistani infiltrators, believed to be members of the border action team, were also killed in the gunfight.   The tricolour-wrapped coffin carrying the body of the 36-year-old soldier reached his Suligam village on Monday after a wreath laying ceremony at Akhnoor Garrison.  But due to some delay, the cremation could not take place and the family decided to perform the last rites on Tuesday morning.   However, his pregnant wife Shimu Devi developed labour pain at around midnight and was admitted to district hospital where she delivered the baby girl at around 5 am, officials said.   They said Devi along with the new born was taken to the cremation ground Chamba-Seri in an ambulance for the last glimpse of her husband. Later, the last rites of the soldier were performed with full military honours, the officials said.   The soldier waited for 10 years for the birth of his first child but destiny had something else in store for him, Vijay Kumar, a local resident known to the family, said.   Singh had joined the Army in 2003 and was planning to take a leave to be with his wife who was expecting a baby anytime, he said.   The entire village is in deep mourning but the arrival of the child is expected to help the family to overcome the grief, Kumar added.   The soldier is survived by his parents, three younger sisters and as many brothers who live in a joint family. ",INDIA
Can Common Game Rooms for Children in Uttarakhand Villages Help Reduce Caste Tensions? ,"Any mention of the hill state of Uttarakhand brings to mind scenes of misty mountains, clouds and to some, even the earthy smell of marijuana. But to those living in the rural interiors of the state, the mountains are not a scenic escape but an insurmountable nemesis that often keep them from availing basic amenities that city-dwellers so easily take for granted. Take, for example, the easy availability for children to play games in their neighbourhoods. Growing up in cities with easy access to safe and premeditated spaces for studying and playing, one can often forget that these simple amenities may, in fact, be a luxury in remote areas.  Noting the difficulty, three student researchers have decided to bring about a change by creating games rooms for children in remote villages in Uttarakhand.  Former Jadavpur University students Payal Sarkar and Souradeep Chakraborty from Kolkata along with Ankaj Kumar from Ranchi University were working on their fellowship. The two-year programme required them to facilitate teachers and children of primary schools for better development of a child's growth and to create public system projects and they have been working in Uttarakhand's Bagheshwar district for almost two years now for the same.  It was while working in the secluded Pindar Valley when they noticed the lack of wholesome educational and recreation avenues for children in the villages of the valley. While villages and communities did have schools, these were often in dilapidated conditions with limited resources and teaching staff and were focused entirely on stoic teaching of theory, if so.  ""Children need more than just book learning to truly develop their personalities. We wanted to introduce recreation as a form of personality development where children can enjoy a more holistic approach to learning,"" said Payal Sarkar, a former student of international relations. She added that allowing children safe spaces for positive exploration of creative interests was important to their mental growth.  Some of the villages that they have been working in have no motorable roads and can only be accessed on foot, making resources very scarce. Darkness descends quicker on mountains and electricity is scarce, leaving children with almost no options for recreation and relaxation. At first, the trio intended the games rooms to be built inside the schools already present in the villages. But the idea was called off and the trio decided to make the games rooms in areas that are openly accessible to the entire community.  ""Only a certain number of children go to school. We wanted to build the games rooms outside of schools so that all children can access it equally, even if they don't go to school,"" Payal said.  Not All Play  Providing a common space for children to gather and play, discuss and participate in activities together is not just aimed at holistic personality development. According to the young researchers, rural Uttarakhand continues to be bound by a stringent caste system that often exhibits itself in the form of social discrimination and boycott. The problem is so pervasive that it seeps through even to the children. For example, Souradeep Chakraborty told News18 that in some villages, upper caste children refer to those from 'lower' castes as 'bimar' (sick). Many people do not allow members of lower castes to eat at their place, even at a wedding. 'Lower' caste guests are provided with rations and are expected to cook their own meal.  ""The problem of caste is deeply rooted and to weed it out, one has to attack the very foundation. Sensitizing future generations is one of the basic steps toward ensuring that such injustices do not continue,"" said Souradeep. He added that the community games rooms would act as a place for children of all castes and classes to play and enjoy together.The trio also hopes that by bringing children together, the common recreation centres would also promote healthy interaction between boys and girls. Many girls, especially in rural areas, continue to get married off as minors and often not allowed to mix freely in society after puberty or even continue their education. Young girls suffer various taboos including ones against menstruation. Payal has been trying to get the schools in the villages they have been working in to adopt a sanitary napkin vending corner for girl students and has also held sessions with children and parents regarding women's' menstrual and sexual health.  Ankaj Kumar, who has a BBA degree and hails from Bihar, has taken career counselling sessions in order to tell both men and women the professional options available to them and guide them into making more beneficial decisions in future.  ""Most children here grow up to join the army. It's the dominant profession here. And women are married off early so they usually don't work,"" Ankaj said.  The career counselling is important both from a gender and caste perspective as both engender professional side-effects. According to the researchers, most members of the Scheduled Caste were engaged in daily wage work and did not have steady jobs. Most of them worked as has and musk farmers. With the community games rooms, the researchers hope to at least generate a conversation and questions about oppression and discrimination among the youth instead of normalising it.A Hard Task  The trio has chosen three villages - Uniya, Sorag and Khati - all part of the Wacham cluster in Pindar Valley, to begin their first trial. These villages have near zero cellular network and were largely cut off from the modern world.  At first, the trio decided to first become part of the communities and understand their problems. Each adopted a village and underwent an immersion process in which they started living with people from the respective villages, even working there. They noted the schools in each of the village and started speaking to the village elders and teachers regarding the state of junior, elementary and higher education in Pindar Valley. After living over one and a half years of living in the district and closely observing the cultural and socio-economic fabric of the area, the trio decided to launch the campaign to improve the lives of children in secluded areas.  To start a conversation about creating recreational spaces for children was at first hard since most of the people were struggling to manage their incomes and other hardships that come with living deep in the mountains. The three students first approached parents and children individually and slowly involved members of local bodies and stakeholders to get the work started. In August, gram sabhas were held by the three in all three villages, which were attended by villagers as well as members of the gram panchayat following which they procured permission for the project. The villagers have allowed the trio to use certain existing building to set up the game rooms. However, the three are still short on funding.  They have managed to raise about Rs 25,000, Souradeep said. But they still need about Rs 75,000 to successfully build three games rooms and are still running an online fundraising campaign for the same.  Deciding content for the 'games' was also challenging as it involved coming up with ideas involving everyday things that would easily be available on the secluded mountains.  ""We designed the games in such a way that anyone could play them anywhere. They don't require any boards or dices,"" Payal said. One such game is a local adaptation of Chinese Whispers, another involves sketching.  Souradeep also has plans to create a book of illustrations that would contain stories told to him by villagers. He wants to print the book in several languages including in the local tongue 'danpuriya'. He has been collecting stories for months now and felt that the book would help bring out the personal lives and hardships that these remote populations suffer.If the first trial is successful, the trio plan to take the project forth at a state level and expand to creating library corners and other creative spaces for the young in remote areas.",INDIA

UGC Decision 'Unfortunate': IIT-Madras Writes to HRD Over Denial of Eminence Tag ,"New Delhi: In a letter to Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar, IIT-Madras has expressed its ""deep disappointment"" for not being able to find a place among one of India’s six Institutions of Eminence (IoEs) despite a recommendation from the UGC-mandated selection panel.  Industrialist and IIT-Madras chairman Pawan Goenka is learnt to have conveyed the concerns of the Board of Governors (BoG) to Javadekar almost a month after the IoE announcement was made on July 9, reported The Indian Express.  An empowered expert committee (EEC), under former Chief Election Commissioner N Gopalaswami, recommended six higher education institutions for the eminence tag: IIT-Bombay, IISc, Bangalore and IIT-Delhi, Jio Institute, BITS Pilani and Manipal University.  Goenka is learnt to have informed Javadekar that the BoG was surprised that the Commission used rankings by a commercial agency to select only three public institutions from the EEC list. The selection, he is learnt to have written, was neither based on the findings of the EEC nor the government’s own National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF), reported The Indian Express.  Goenka reiterated IIT-Madras’s NIRF performance in his letter to the Union Minister and described the UGC’s decision as “unfortunate”, said The Indian Express. The paper further reported that Goenka wrote saying that the decision could affect the morale of teachers and students.  The EEC submitted its report where it stated that it could not find 20 such institutes that could bag the tag of IoEs owing to weakness in activities related to quality of research. The UGC then announced the name of the above mentioned six institutes.  While government institutes will be eligible for both greater autonomy and additional funding of up to Rs 1,000 crore, private institutes will not be eligible for any funding.  As per the guidelines, the Institution of Eminence shall continue to be ranked in the National Institutional Ranking Framework and, within five years of notification, shall get itself ranked in an international Ranking index of repute.  However, if the selected institution is unable to meet the goals at the end of fifth and subsequent years and there are grave enough deviations, The Ministry of Human Resource Development can ask for removal of the Institution of Eminence status and reverting it to the original status.",INDIA
Six Booked Under Gangsters Act in Noida's Gautam Buddh Nagar ,"Noida: The Gautam Buddh Nagar district administration Tuesday said it has invoked the stringent Gangsters Act against six persons for their alleged involvement in crimes in the district.  District Magistrate Brajesh Narain Singh, based on a report by Senior Superintendent of Police Ajay Pal Sharma, pressed charges under the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention)Act, 1986 against these persons, an official statement said.  The Act has been invoked against Rajneesh Kumar of Ghaziabad, Pankaj Kumar Singh, Pappu Singh and Mohd Amamul Haq of Delhi, and Rajesh Bharadwaj and Jai Pal of Faridabad, it said.  ""The district administration is committed to ensuring continuous strict action against people of criminal nature.

"In Paytm Founder's Extortion Plot, Another Ransom Call, Death Threats and a Shareholding Standoff Surface ","New Delhi: As the Vice President of Paytm and corporate communication face of the brand, Sonia Dhawan, spends her first night in jail, more than one version is coming up about what exactly lead to the arrest.   While the police is steadfast on the ransom call angle, Sonia’s lawyer Prashant Tripathi raised some key questions regarding the case on Tuesday.  Prashant alleged even Sonia was a victim of a ransom call. Her husband Rupak Jain, also arrested in the case, filed a complaint with the sector 49 police station on September 22.   The complaint says he had received a call, where the caller had asked for a substantial amount of money and threatened to kill him and his son if he failed to pay up. The lawyer alleged that the cops sat on this complaint for days and did not even check the number from where the call was made.   But what led to such a drastic change in relationship between Dhawan and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma?   Most journalists who have covered the start-up industry say it was almost impossible to bypass Sonia, if one had to interact with Vijay Shekhar. She had spent 10 years at the company and risen from the post of her personal secretary to the VP.   Tripathi suggests this could be related to the recent share repurchase plan of the promoters of the company. He claims Sonia refused to part with her share of the money and that could have led to this standoff.  The cops continue to maintain that Sonia masterminded the operation which involved three others, including her husband, to extort over Rs 20 crore from Sharma.   Some of those in the know of things inside the company also alleged about certain photographs which were used to by her to blackmail the Paytm founder.   But her lawyer asked the court why a shareholding employee who was promoted as the Vice President only a month ago and was given rather handsome bonus would indulge in anything like this.   While not denying that there were small tiffs with the Paytm founder, Tripathi maintained that those were not something for which she would damage the reputation of a company for which she gave her blood and sweat.  Three people, including Sonia and another Paytm employee, were arrested by Noida police on Monday for allegedly trying to extort Rs 20 crore from the e-wallet giant's founder after threatening to leak stolen personal data and confidential information.   All three have now been sent to jail after the court refused to grant bail to the accused.",INDIA

"Feuding CBI Chief, Deputy Divested of All Charges; Joint Director Nageshwar Rao Takes Over for Now ","New Delhi: CBI director Alok Verma and special director Rakesh Asthana have been divested of all charges in the midst of an internal rift over bribery allegations against the latter. As per a government order, CBI joint director Nageshwar Rao will take interim charge of the investigation agency.  According to an order by the Department of Personnel and Training, Rao shall “look after the duties and functions of Director CBI and shall take over the duties and functions with immediate effect.”  WhatsApp Image 2018-10-24 at 07.12.31  The order implies that the government has sidelined all the three additional directors number three in the agency's hierarchy, including A K Sharma, whose name had figured in the complaint by Asthana, PTI reported. Sources told News18 that the offices of Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana will remain sealed while the case is pending.   Speaking to CNN-News18 on the rift within the probe agency, former CBI chief DR Karthikeyan said, “The government must have taken into consideration all facts, perhaps action could have been taken much earlier. This disaster could have been prevented by action on time.”  Rao, who hails from Warangal district in Telangana, is from the 1986 batch of Orissa cadre.  The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the CBI to maintain status quo on the criminal proceedings initiated against Asthana, who has challenged the FIR lodged against him on bribery allegations.  The case emanates from a statement recorded by a Hyderabad-based real estate agent Sathish Sana whose role was being investigated by a team led by Asthana in a bribery case allegedly involving meat exporter Moin Qureshi.   It was alleged that Sana had paid Rs 50 lakh as bribe to Qureshi, which was shown as investment in his company, to get relief in a bribery case.   A Special Investigation Team led by Rakesh Asthana was probing the matter and was repeatedly questioning Sana in this regard as it suspected him of lying in the matter.  A lookout notice was also issued against him by the investigation which prevented him from leaving the country on September 25, 2018, Sana had said in his statement which is part of the FIR.  The team also submitted a proposal to arrest him as it felt the need for custodial interrogation on October 20, 2018 before the director which was not cleared and sent for the opinion of Directorate of Prosecution.  ""The arrest is ordered only when certain parameters are fulfilled. The sanctioning authority satisfies itself whether arrest is warranted or not. The due procedure was followed,"" CBI spokesperson said on the question of Asthana's claims.  Asthana in his complaint to the Cabinet Secretary on August 24 had alleged that CBI Director Alok Verma had received a bribe of Rs 2 crore from Sana to help him get relief from repeated questioning.  He had also alleged that Verma had called him over phone in February to not call Sana for questioning.  In a surprising and unprecedented move on October 15, the CBI booked Asthana and investigation officer of the case on the charges of receiving bribe from Sana through middlemen Manoj Prasad and Somesh Prasad.  The CBI has arrested Devender Kumar, the Deputy SP and investigation officer, alleging that he had fabricated the statement of Sana purportedly claiming that a Rajya Sabha MP had met Verma on his pending case and assured him of relief and a clean chit.

"SC Pulls Up Centre Over Delhi Sealing, Says 'You're Stalling Everything' ","New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday pulled up the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs for ""stalling everything"" and not coming out with a procedure for issuance of notice to defaulters who have carried out illegal constructions in Delhi.  The apex court said the ministry seeking two adjournments for bringing the agreed procedure was ""too much"" and the attitude of the authorities concerned was that ""everybody is to be blamed except us"".  ""Why is your ministry stalling everything? They are stalling everything. For an agreed procedure, two adjournments have been taken. What is this happening? This is too much,"" a bench of justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta told Additional Solicitor General (ASG) A N S Nadkarni, appearing for the Centre.  When the ASG said deliberations were going on and the ministry was considering a rule book, the bench said, ""We will see the rule book. Everybody here is for a boxing match"".  ""Everybody is to be blamed except us, that is the attitude of everybody. It is just like going on in circle. Let us see your rule book and finalise it once and for all,"" the bench said.  The top court told Nadkarni that the ministry has to help the people of Delhi in this matter.  ""If in Delhi, you will fight like this then you will have to fight in all other parts of the country also. Why this confrontation?,"" it said.  Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, assisting the apex court as an amicus curiae in the sealing matter, referred to a report filed by the court-appointed monitoring committee.  In its repot, the committee has claimed that the Land and Development Office (L&DO) was deliberately attempting to stall the sealing operation of unauthorised constructions in Delhi.  The report said that official of L&DO has not attended meetings of the monitoring committee and he was not even answering the phone calls from the panel.  The ASG said that such an act was unacceptable after which the bench asked him to make a phone call to the L&DO.  The ASG later told the court that the L&DO was not well and was down with eye flu and he would file an affidavit in this regard.  During the hearing, the bench asked why the special task force (STF), constituted on April 25 following the court's order to oversee enforcement of laws on illegal constructions here, was not filing their reports in the matter.  ""What are we supposed to do? Your vice-chairman of DDA (Delhi Development Authority), L&DO do not do anything. Your ministry is not responding. I fail to understand what are we supposed to do,"" Justice Lokur observed.  The ASG told the court that he would place before the court an agreed procedure for issuance of notice to defaulters who have carried out illegal constructions in Delhi.  The bench has posted the matter for hearing on October 31.  The monitoring committee on sealing, comprising K J Rao, former advisor to the Election Commissioner; Bhure Lal, chairman of Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority; and Major General (Retd) Som Jhingan, was set up on March 24, 2006, by the top court.  The court is also seized of the issue related to validity of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006 and subsequent legislations which protect unauthorised construction from being sealed.",INDIA
Sri Lanka Wants Chinese Help to Recover Phone Evidence in 'Assassination Plot' Blamed on India ,"Colombo: Sri Lankan police on Tuesday won permission from a court to ask Chinese phone manufacturer Huawei to help recover data from a phone used by a police informant who has alleged a plot to kill President Maithripala Sirisena.   Informant Namal Kumara said at a news conference last month he had discussed the plot by phone with a senior police officer. He has since been questioned but not charged with any offence.  Former Sri Lankan defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was also a target of the plot, Kumara said.  Officials at the Criminal Investigation Department of police on Tuesday told the court that some of Kumara's phone data, which could be evidence, had been deleted and they needed Huawei's technical help to retrieve it.  Sri Lankan law prevents police from asking Huawei to help without first obtaining explicit permission from a court. The court granted it on Tuesday.   A man named as M. Thomas from Kerala was arrested in Sri Lanka on September 22 on suspicion of involvement in the plot.   Thomas appeared in court on Tuesday and requested that he not remain in CID custody, saying there had been death threats against him by the CID. The magistrate denied Thomas' request.   The alleged plot briefly threatened to cause tension between Sri Lanka and India, after media reports that Sirisena had accused India's intelligence services of involvement — a claim New Delhi and Colombo have both denied.",INDIA
"Rajinikanth Flags Trappings of Money, Shares Political Vision with Fan Club ","Chennai Top film star Rajinikanth, who is set to enter politics, has said he is committed to ushering in a change in the political horizon sans the trappings of money and lure of posts.  Sharing his political vision with members of the Rajini Makkal Mandram, a precusor forum to his to-be launched party, he recalled his assertion last year that he will never allow those eyeing money and posts in his political innings and said it was not a mere rhetoric.  ""We are for ushering in a good change in politics. Why should I come to politics only to do politics like others..?"" he asked in a communique to the forum members, a copy of which was made available to the media.  ""The objective of our coming to politics is very very important,"" he said adding it was imperative to refrain from those who harbour ""wrong thoughts,"" and ""protect ourselves,"" an apparent reference to those eyeing politics to achieve self-aggrandising goals.  Rajinikanth also advised the forum members to take care of their families first.  ""No one need to take up Mandram's activities without taking care of their families,"" he said in a communique, a copy of which was made available to the media.  The actor expressed his views in the light of recent disciplinary action against some office bearers and a ""misinformation campaign"" that such steps were taken without his knowledge.  Defending the action, he said only those who had acted against the RMM's principles were removed.  Such people did not execute the task assigned to them and also prevented enthusiastic members from going ahead with the  work, he said.  ""I am well aware of the all the honest work and it will not go waste,"" the actor, who is the chief of the forum, said.  Rajinikanth, who had months ago disapproved those belonging to religious and caste based outfits from joining the RMM, said he had not asked any member to spend money for the forum.  The RMM has been working to enroll new members and expand its footprint across Tamil Nadu ahead of the launch of the proposed party.  He also said without the support of the people, ""We could not achieve what we aspire for.""  He made it clear that a membership in his fans club for 30-40 years alone will not fetch someone a post in RMM and make him eligible to involve in politics.  Rajinikanth, who last December announced his decision to enter politics, has recently said he would launch the party at the appropriate time.",INDIA
"Journalist Apologises in Odisha Assembly for Derogatory Remarks on Konark Temple, Arrested ","Bhubaneswar: Delhi-based journalist Abhijit Iyer-Mitra on Tuesday appeared before a House Committee of the state assembly over his alleged anti-Odisha remarks and tendered an unconditional apology after which he was arrested by the police.  As soon as he stepped out of the assembly, Iyer-Mitra was arrested for allegedly hurting religious sentiments of people and making derogatory remarks against the state, the Konark temple and Lord Jagannath.  Iyer-Mitra was charged under various sections of the IPC on the basis of an FIR filed at the Saheed Nagar police station here, Bhubaneswar ACP (Zone-5) Kishore Mund said.  A complaint was lodged against Iyer-Mitra by Manoranjan Mohanty on September 20 for allegedly hurting religious sentiments of the people of Odisha. After his arrest, Iyer-Mitra was taken to the Capital Hospital for a medical check-up, following which he will be produced in the court, the ACP said.  Chairman of the House committee Narasingha Mishra, who is also the Leader of Opposition in the Odisha assembly, told reporters that ""Abhijit Iyer-Mitra confessed to the allegations against him and sought an unconditional apology for his stupidity. He has been directed to depose before the committee and submit an affidavit in this regard.""  He further said, ""The committee will decide whether to accept his apology or not after examining his affidavit. Accordingly, the committee will then recommend the House to take action against him if necessary.""  Mishra said Iyer-Mitra has been asked to reappear before the House Committee on November 2.   Earlier on September 20, Odisha assembly Speaker PK Amat had set up a House Committee to probe the alleged derogatory remarks against the state, its culture and the lawmakers made by Iyer-Mitra.  Though the committee had earlier summoned Iyer-Mitra to appear before it on October 11, he failed to turn up. A notice was then sent to him for appearance before the committee on October 23.  Abhijit Iyer-Mitra in September had posted a video on his Twitter handle where he ""criticised Odisha, its people, Lord Jagannath, Konark temple and also Odisha lawmakers.""  Two FIRs were registered against him at the Konark police station in Puri district and Saheed Nagar police station in Khurda district under different sections of the IPC.  Iyer-Mitra also allegedly flew in a helicopter over the eco-sensitive Chilika Lake at a low level along with his friend and former BJD MP Baijayant Panda.  He was earlier arrested by the Odisha Police on September 20 in Delhi and subsequently, granted bail till October 5 by a trial court which directed him to cooperate in the probe.  Iyer-Mitra then moved the Supreme Court on October 4 seeking extension of his bail tenure but the plea was dismissed.",INDIA
'No Such Restrictions Even in Mughal Era': Ujjain BJP MP Vows to Defy SC Ruling on Firecrackers ,"Hours after the Supreme Court said the bursting of firecrackers on Diwali would be restricted between 8 and 10pm, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Ujjain Chintamani Malviya said he would not tolerate any interference in Hindu traditions.  In a social media post, Malviya said “religions traditions and festivals are followed by Hindu calendar” and he was ready to go to jail to uphold his traditions. “I will burst crackers only when I finish puja, we can't set time limits on festivals, such restrictions were not even in Mughal times. It’s unacceptable,” he said.  The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to order a country-wide ban on firecrackers, holding that compliance with certain safeguards will rather help strike a balance.  A bench headed by Justice AK Sikri said ""improved and green"" crackers can be manufactured and sold only by the licensed holders. The court imposed a complete ban on the sale of firecrackers by e-commerce firms, including Amazon and Flipkart.  It added that firecrackers will also have to comply with the prescribed noise levels and also barred the use of some chemicals, including barium salt, in the manufacturing.  The court clarified that on festivals, including Diwali, the bursting of firecrackers will be allowed only between 8pm and 10pm. On Christmas and New Year's Eve, the bench said, crackers can be burst between 11.45pm and 12.45am.",INDIA

"CBI War Plays Out in Court: Called a ‘Pest’, No. 2 Boss Asthana Says Will Disclose Shocking Affairs of Agency ","New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the CBI to maintain status quo on the criminal proceedings initiated against the agency's Special Director Rakesh Asthana and a trial court sent an arrested mid-level officer facing bribery charges to seven-day remand, as the unprecedented battle between the two top officers of the CBI entered the judicial arena.  During the court hearing, the CBI also submitted that charges of extortion and forgery were added against Asthana and Devender Singh, a Deputy Superintendent police of CBI who was arrested Monday by the agency for allegedly taking bribe and falsification of records.  After Asthana approached the Delhi High Court seeking quashing of the agency's FIR against him, a single judge bench directed the CBI to maintain status quo on the criminal proceedings initiated against him till October 29, the next date of hearing, but clarified there was no stay on the ongoing probe considering the nature and gravity of the case.  The high court asked both Asthana and Kumar to preserve the records of the case and also their mobile records.  On a day of fast paced developments, Devender Singh moved the Delhi High Court seeking quashing of the FIR against him and handing over of documents relating to the case.  This was followed by a similar petition in the high court by Asthana, a Gujarat cadre IPS officer, who has been continuously writing to the anti-corruption watchdog, Central Vigilance Commission, on alleged interference of the CBI Director in his probe in the case related to controversial meat exporter Moin Qureshi.  Justice Najmi Waziri issued notices and sought responses of the probe agency and its Director Verma as also Joint Director A K Sharma on both the petitions.  The notice was also issued to Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), which is the administrative arm for the CBI and whose permission is required to be taken for probes against bureaucrats.  The counsel for Asthana, whose name figures in the CBI FIR, pointed out before Justice Waziri that a case had been registered against the special Director based on a statement of an accused and said there is a great amount of ""sorrow"". However, the judge said this was not the stage to examine the allegation of malafide.  CBI's counsel said the FIR was registered under the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act and the IPC, including criminal conspiracy, and that they have added more sections against the accused relating to extortion and forgery.  The court turned down the plea of Asthana's counsel seeking to stay further proceedings in the matter. ""Nothing will happen. Tomorrow is Maharishi Valmiki's birthday, kuch nahi hoga (nothing will happen),"" the judge said and asked the CBI not to disturb the equilibrium on Tuesday.  The hostility was laid bare when during the course of the hearing, the CBI counsel remarked that Asthana's presence in the organisation was akin to pest in the wood. CBI's counsel K Raghavacharyulu, in an apparent reference to Asthana, said that ""if there is pest in wood, wood will become useless"". He repeated that ""wood will be useless, if pest catches it"".  Justice Najmi Waziri then interjected and warned the counsel from making such comments. ""Don't make such statements in the court. Don't use these things here. Such statements have no place in the court,"" he said.   Asthana, on his end, accused the agency's chief Alok Verma of trying to ""falsely implicate"" him in the bribery case to ""hide"" his own alleged criminal misconduct of influencing investigations in lieu of money.  He said his petition would disclose the ""shocking state of affairs and also reveal as to how the highest officer of the premier investigating agency of the country is trying to falsely implicate the petitioner, who is the second senior most officer of the agency, in order to hide his own criminal misconduct of influencing investigations in exchange for money"".  Kumar, earlier the investigating officer in a case involving meat exporter Moin Qureshi, was arrested on the allegations of forgery in recording the statement of businessman Sathish Sana, who is alleged to have paid bribe to get relief in the case.  He was produced before the designated CBI court which sent him to CBI's remand for seven days. The court termed the offence as ""grave"" and noted that there were serious allegations about the involvement of public servants including accused, who has been charged by the agency of being a part of an extortion racket being run in the garb of investigation.  During the proceedings, the agency also informed the court that it has added some fresh sections - 384 (punishment for extortion), 388 (extortion by threat of accusation of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life), 389 (putting person in fear of accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) - of the IPC in its FIR.",INDIA

Fake Bank Apps May Have Stolen Data of Thousands of Customers: Report ,"New Delhi: Fake apps of SBI, ICICI, Axis Bank, Citi and other leading banks are available on Google Play, which may have stolen data of thousands of bank customers, claims a report by IT security firm Sophos Labs.  These fake android apps have logos of respective banks which makes it difficult for customers to differentiate between the fake and original apps, it said. The report further said the deceptive malware in these apps may have stolen thousands of customers' account and credit card details.  When contacted, some of the banks mentioned in the report said they have not come across any such fake apps. However, some banks have started inquiry and also informed the CERT-In — the national nodal agency for responding to computer security incident.  The fake apps target seven banks — SBI, ICICI, Axis, Indian Overseas, BoB, Yes Bank and Citi Bank — the report said.  According to Citi India spokesperson, the bank is not impacted by these apps as mentioned in the report. The bank has also written to the Sophos Labs to remove the Citi's name from the report.  Another lender Yes Bank said it has informed the bank's cyber fraud department about the matter. However, the country's largest lender State Bank of India's response was awaited.   According to the report, the apps lured victims to download and use them, either by masquerading as Internet apps or e-wallets, promising rewards, including cash back on purchases, free mobile data or interest free loans.   Some even claimed to be providing a too-good-to-be-true service, enabling users to withdraw cash from an ATM and have it delivered to their doorstep. ""Deceptive malware may have stolen thousands of Indian sub-continent bank customers account data or credit card numbers,” said Pankaj Kohli, threat researcher, SophosLabs.   Fake apps are not new to Android and this sort of malware will continue to find its way into the android app store, it said.   ""Some are blatant copies of real apps, while a few are much more dangerous as they seed malware and steal data from user accounts. Users should always use antivirus software, which provides malware protection and internet security to keep users protected and stop these fake apps from stealing data,"" it said.",INDIA

""During the festival season, there will be large crowds in places connected with Sabarimala pilgrimage and these type of protests by frenzied devotees and protesters may lead to crowd turbulence and stampede which may lead to injuries to pilgrims, police and others and loss of life,"" Manoj said.  The report was submitted a day after the shrine closed at the end of the five-day monthly puja during which frenzied devotees of Lord Ayyappa, the eternally celibate deity, prevented around a dozen women in the 10-50 age group from entering the shrine.  Since October 17 when the shrine opened for the first time after the Supreme Court lifted a long-standing ban on women of 10-50 age group, its complex and nearby areas had witnessed protests against permitting women in the menstrual age group to trek the hill shrine.  Several organisations of Ayyappa devotees and political parties had launched protests in the form of prayer chanting processions against the permission granted by the top court to all women devotees to offer prayers at Sabarimala.  The protesters had set up tents in Nilakkal and gathered there in large numbers and began checking vehicles.

OPINION | Bad News for DMK Too as AIADMK Abandons 'Anna' for 'Amma' ,"A defining trait of Dravidian politics is the quest to wrest the legacy of a departed leader. It’s not just a symbolic, emotional quest, but one that defines the very existence of a political party, like the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).   Since its inception, the AIADMK never created the post of president in the party and the highest post within is that of the general secretary.  This was because the late MG Ramachandran, who broke away from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and founded the AIADMK in 1972, asserted that his eternal leader was DMK founder CN Annadurai and, hence, the highest post in the party was symbolically, eternally left for Anna.  MGR left the DMK following differences with M Karunanidhi, who took over as president of the party and chief minister after Anna passed away in 1969, and had to reassert that he and his party represented the true principles of the Dravidian movement as claimants to the 'Anna' legacy.  In effect, both Karunanidhi and MGR represented the same political ideology of their mentor; before the electorate, it was only a bitter personal rivalry that was a defining difference. This, and not just the influence of cinema, is the genesis of the personality-oriented politics in the state.   Cinema did fuel the rivalry and help build the personalities, but the reason the rivalry and personalities are so fiercely projected in the state is because without the personality rivalries, the AIADMK versus DMK battle has no foundation. In other words, there is no scope for an ideological difference or debate as both would be on the same side.   The rivalry had to be intense to fuel political differentiation and it manifested itself through the twists and turns over the last five decades. Most recently, it was this battle for Anna’s legacy that led to the dispute over granting a final resting place for M Karunanidhi, next to CN Annadurai’s memorial, at the Marina beach.  Since MGR was buried on one side of the Anna memorial, it was imperative for the DMK to ensure that Karunanidhi was buried on the other side to symbolically assert their departed leader as the political heir to Anna. The AIADMK dispensation tried to deny that space, but lost the battle in the Madras High Court.   Now, a renewed DMK, under MK Stalin’s leadership, is reasserting itself as the only custodian of Dravidian political principles of Annadurai and there seems to be no powerful counter to that claim from the AIADMK.  The ruling AIADMK faction in the state is fighting its battle within the party for the ‘Amma’ legacy. It is desperate to establish itself as the true custodian of Jayalalithaa’s legacy and that claim is being challenged by rebel leader TTV Dinakaran, who split from the AIADMK to launch his own party.   The core of the power struggle between the two sections is to wrest the ‘Amma’ legacy and establish themselves as custodians of it. The winner in this battle, in an election, would claim to be the heir to the late Jayalalithaa.   While their objective is to capture power in the state, like in the past, in the eyes of the electorate, they have no other explanation or narrative for political existence. But this battle is within the AIADMK as a party and not with a political opponent outside of it. The factions are similar in character and represent the exact same political thought feeding on the battle for legacy as a narrative for political existence.  The problem is that the AIADMK, in search of an ‘Amma’ legacy, does not have a leader of stature to challenge the DMK’s claim to represent the ‘Anna’ legacy. Though Jayalalithaa was not from the same vintage as MGR or Karunanidhi, she had the stature to reiterate the AIADMK’s position as a challenger to the DMK, but after her demise, there is no other leader to carry forward that challenge.   Arguably, the reason the AIADMK has survived is because Jayalalithaa was in power when she passed away and the party is surviving on the remnants of that victory.   In fact, no other political party in the state, barring MDMK leader Vaiko, has the stature to challenge the DMK as the most powerful custodians of the Anna legacy.   This is dangerous not just for the AIADMK, but for the future of Dravidian political ideology itself as it is the quest for the ‘Anna’ legacy that is the bedrock of the political narrative which remained between the two Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu.   And, it is because of the dominance of the AIADMK versus DMK personality battle that there was no space for any other political ideology to evolve in the state.   In this backdrop, when there is no challenge to the DMK narrative as the custodian of core Dravidian principles, the field is thrown open for a counter ideological force.  This is what the next election in Tamil Nadu will test and decide. The smaller question would be which of the AIADMK factions will wrest the ‘Amma’ legacy, but the more significant question would be whether the battle would continue to be fought among those who claim to be custodians of an ‘Anna’ legacy or will it eventually turn into one between an ‘Anna’ legacy and an opposing political force that has nothing to do with that legacy or even opposes it on an ideological level.   The answer to that question would lie in how the AIADMK recovers and if it does not, which political force will occupy the space of opposition to the DMK. In fact, this would be important even for the DMK from a long-term perspective.   Having an ideological opponent in the electoral fray is something the party has not experienced in the last four decades and, hence, it may have to see the collapse of an AIADMK with worry instead of jubilation.

"Got a Call from PM's Office When I Objected to Raising Salaries of MPs, Says Varun Gandhi ","Bhiwani (UP): BJP lawmaker Varun Gandhi Tuesday said when he raised objections about increase in salaries of MPs, he got a call from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), asking ""why are you increasing our troubles?""  During a programme in Model Women's College here, the Sultanpur MP said, ""I repeatedly raise my voice about the increase in salaries of MPs and not giving details of their assets. Employees of every sector get increase in their wages based on hard work and honesty. But in the last 10 years, MPs have increased their salaries seven times just by raising their hands.""  ""When I raised this issue once, I received a call from the PMO,"" he said. ""Why are you increasing our troubles?""  Questioning the education system of the country, he gave examples of schools in Uttar Pradesh.  ""In Uttar Pradesh schools, except studies, all programme are held. Religious and marriage functions are organised, after funeral, the rituals are completed on the premises. Children play cricket and leaders deliver speeches in schools,"" Gandhi said.  He said every year Rs 3 lakh crores are spent on education, but 89 per cent of the money is spent on buildings, which cannot be called education.  ""Today, 40 per cent of farmers in the country take land on contract, which is illegal because they do not get any help from the government, neither do they get a loan or compensation if the crop is wasted. In the last 10 years, the input cost for farmers has increased threefold, causing distress which led to suicide by 17,000 farmers in Vidarbha,"" he said.  He also described the increasing pollution in the country as ""dangerous"" and suggested instead of giving a bouquet of flowers to somebody, give them a plant.",POLITICS
"Computer Baba, Former MP Minister, Takes Lead to Unite Seers Against 'Anti-religion' BJP Govt ","Indore: Days after he resigned as a Madhya Pradesh minister of state, self-styled godman Computer Baba Tuesday launched a campaign to unite seers against the ""anti-religion"" Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in the poll-bound state.  Computer Baba alias Namdeo Das Tyagi had resigned on October 1, six months after he was accorded the MoS status while accusing the chief minister of not fulfilling promises, including cleaning the Narmada river.  Addressing a gathering of about 1000 seers from 13 Akharas (spiritual denominations) in Indore Tuesday, the godman appealed to uproot the BJP government in the November 28 polls.  ""(CM) Shivraj Singh Chouhan had promised me that the Narmada river will be kept clean and illegal sand mining won't be allowed. But these promises were not kept. Now we have understood that the Shivraj government is anti-religion,"" he said.  The godman also accused the state government of ""doing nothing"" for the protection of cows and ""destroying Hindu shrines, temples and dwellings of seers in the state"". Many seers also attacked the state government on a string of issues including quota, construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, Vyapam scam and ""rising spate"" of crimes against minor girls, at the gathering.  Some local Congress leaders were also spotted at the gathering.  However, Computer Baba said the Congress leaders had nothing to do with the congregation which was open to all. ""We are not supporting any party but are against this anti-religion government which should be uprooted in the forthcoming assembly elections,"" he said.  He announced to organise such gatherings in Gwalior, Khandwa, Rewa and Jabalpur in coming days, where sants from various parts of the country will be invited.  Meanwhile, BJP vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe refused to comment on the campaign launched by Baba. ""I will not comment over the issue as we respect all sants. Agitations take place in democracy,"" he told reporters here.",POLITICS
Sharad Pawar Reveals He Had His First Brush with Politics When He Was Only Four Days Old ,"Mumbai: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar had his first brush, literally, with politics as a four-day-old. The former Union minister, who has completed 51 years in electoral politics, made the revelation at a book release event on Tuesday evening.  Pawar said he was just four days old when his mother Shardabai, who was elected as the chairperson of local municipal works committee in Pune in 1938, carried him in a state transport bus to Pune where she was scheduled to cast her vote.  Pawar said Shardabai was the driving force behind her seven sons and four daughters, all of whom acquired graduate degrees in various disciplines like law, engineering, architecture, metallurgy and agronomy.  The Marathi book, 'Mu Po Aai', edited by journalist Sandeep Kale, has articles by 30 Maharashtrian editors about their mothers. Pawar has penned the foreword for the tome.  Pawar also recalled that as country’s defence minister he insisted on inducting women into armed forces despite repeated rebuffs from the three services chiefs to his plans. ",POLITICS

"As Rajasthan Goes to Polls, Remembering the Stalwart Who Fought From 10 Constituencies and Won Eight ","A former vice-president of India and three-time chief minister of Rajasthan, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat is remembered as a veteran politician and a stalwart state leader.   Referred to as the ‘Lion of Rajasthan’, Shekhawat won his seat in every state assembly election, except in 1972.   From 1952 to 1998, the veteran leader fought 11 assembly elections and emerged victorious 10 times. Over the decades, he fought from 10 different constituencies in Rajasthan and won from eight of them.   As Rajasthan prepares for another assembly election, we take a look at Shekhawat’s political career on his 95th birth anniversary.  As a leader of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, Shekhawat was first elected to the Rajasthan legislative assembly in 1952 from Ramgarh constituency in Sikar district. Five years later, he was again elected to the assembly, this time from Sri Madhopur.  In the 1962 and ‘67 state elections, Shekhawat was elected as a legislator from Kisan Pol, the first time he chose to fight on a seat where he was an incumbent MLA. He met his first assembly election defeat in 1972, when he lost from Gandhinagar. However, in 1973, he won a Rajya Sabha seat from Madhya Pradesh.  During the Emergency, Shekhawat was arrested and sent to Rohtak jail in 1975. After that, he was again elected as an MLA for the Janata Party in the 1977 assembly elections from Chhabra.  Shekhawat became the first non-Congress chief minister of Rajasthan the same year, 25 years into his political career.   The Janata Dal government was dismissed by Indira Gandhi in 1980 and Shekhawat joined the newly formed BJP. With BJP, he was again elected to the state assembly from Chhabra in 1980, assuming the role of leader of the opposition.   After another stint as an MLA and leader of opposition from Nimbahera in 1985, Shekhawat became the chief minister of Rajasthan for the second time in 1990 after winning an MLA seat from Dholpur.  Shekhawat’s government was again dismissed in 1992 following the demolition of the Babri Masjid and the imposition of President’s Rule in Rajasthan. He then contested and won the assembly seat from Bali in 1993 and became the chief minister of Rajasthan for the third time, with the BJP emerging as the single largest party in the state.   In the next elections in 1998, Shekhawat was re-elected from Bali, but the saffron party lost the election. Shekhawat, for the third time, became leader of opposition.  In 2002, he was elected the vice-president of India. He later contested the presidential election in 2007, but lost to Pratibha Patil and resigned from the vice-president’s post.   In 2010, Shekhawat died in Jaipur due to complications stemming from cancer and old age, leaving behind his unique legacy in Rajasthan. Along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani, Shekhawat is credited with laying down the roots of the BJP as a national party.   His record in Rajasthan assembly elections indicated his state-wide appeal and in his five-decade-long political career, Shekhawat contested on different seats throughout the state and proved his mettle by emerging victorious.",POLITICS

"Raman Singh Touches Feet of Yogi Adityanath, 20 Years His Junior, to Seek Blessings for Elections ","Rajnandgaon: Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh, who is seeking his fourth consecutive term, on Tuesday filed his nomination papers from Rajnandgaon assembly constituency for next month's state polls with his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath by his side.  But what caught the attention of those present was Singh’s gesture of touching the feet of Adityanath, 20 years his junior.  Singh is the fourth longest-serving chief minister who is still in office and is several years ahead of Adityanath in political experience.   The 66-year-old joined the Bharatiya Jan Sangh when he was a student in the early 1970s and became the president of its youth wing in 1976-77, while the UP chief minister has completed a little over one-and-a-half years in office.  On Tuesday, Singh was also accompanied by his wife Veena Singh, party in-charge for Chhattisgarh Anil Jain and several other leaders and party workers as he reached the district collectorate to file his papers.   The two-time MLA from Rajanandgaon constituency, Singh is seeking third consecutive victory from the seat. In 2004, he was an MLA from Dongargaon assembly constituency in Rajnandgaon district. The Congress has fielded Karuna Shukla, niece of former prime minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee against Singh from Rajnandgaon.  Ahead of filing nominations, Singh told reporters, ""I have full faith in the strength of party workers and booth-level workers. The BJP has dedicated this election to Atal ji and each party worker has vowed to form the government for the fourth consecutive term with a thumping majority in the state.”  When asked about Shukla contesting against him, Singh said, ""They (Congress) did not get any local candidate...""

"Ajit Jogi's Alliance With BSP Will Hurt Congress in Chhattisgarh, Says BJP Gen Secy ","New Delhi: BJP general secretary Saroj Pandey on Tuesday claimed that the alliance between Ajit Jogi's party and the BSP would hurt the Congress more in Chhattisgarh as she asserted that her party will return to power for a fourth straight term in the state.  Pandey, a Rajya Sabha member and key party leader from the state, also said the opposition Congress is on the back foot due to the alleged involvement of its state president Bhupesh Baghel in a fake sex CD case, which she termed as an insult to the state's women.  The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had last month filed a charge sheet in the case naming Baghel and some others as accused in the case related to the controversial CD allegedly featuring a state minister, who had rejected it as fake. The Congress leader was released on bail after spending three days in judicial custody last month.  The BJP has used the issue to target the Congress, while Baghel has claimed innocence and termed it a political attack.  The state president of a political party should have applied his mind to decide what is in the interest of a state and what is not before putting out such content, Pandey said, dismissing his claim that he was not aware of its authenticity.   ""We are in a very strong position in Chhattisgarh. We will form the government for a fourth straight term,"" she said, adding that the BJP will achieve its president Amit Shah's target of winning 65 plus seats in the 90-member assembly.  The state will go to the polls in two phases on November 12 and 20.  Though Chhattisgarh has always seen a straight fight between the two national parties, the emergence of former chief minister Ajit Jogi-led Janta Congress Chhattisgarh has made things tricky in a state where the difference in vote share between the BJP and the Congress was less than one per cent in 2013.  Jogi, who was earlier in the Congress, has struck an alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which enjoys influence in some parts of the state.  Asked about the possible impact of the alliance, Pandey said influence of any party cannot be discounted in electoral politics but added that Jogi will definitely draw votes from the party he was associated with, a reference to Congress. Overall, the alliance will not be able to make much impact, she said.  The state government led by chief minister Raman Singh has done a lot of good work in different sectors in the last 15 years, she said, adding that ""pro-people"" schemes of the Narendra Modi dispensation will also help the party.  The BJP will see positive change in the tribal-dominated Bastar region, where it could win only four seats compared to eight of the Congress in 2013, she said.  The Naxal-hit region will go to the polls in the first phase on November 12.  In 2013, the BJP had formed the government for third straight term by winning 49 seats against 39 of the Congress but the opposition party succeeded in narrowing the gap. It had grabbed 40.3 per cent of votes while the saffron party cornered 41 per cent of votes. Singh has been at the helm since 2003.",POLITICS
"Shivpal Yadav Announces New Party, Asks Members to Stay Away From Sycophancy ","Lucknow: Weeks after launching the Samajwadi Secular Morcha, Shivpal Singh Yadav on Tuesday announced his new political party, which he registered with the Election Commission as Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party Lohia.  Earlier, Yadav had said his front will contest all 80 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 elections. ""Our new party has been registered. Its name is Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party Lohia,"" Yadav said at an event here to enrol members for the morcha. His aide and former minister Sharda Pratap Shukla said the new party will become a big force in the state.  Yadav launched the SSM on August 29 after falling out with nephew and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav. He had complained that he felt neglected in the SP, which was founded by his elder brother Mulayam Singh Yadav, after his nephew took charge.  Shivpal Yadav, however, is still an SP legislator from Jaswant Nagar in Etawah district.   At Tuesday's event, Shivpal Yadav said he had always wanted ""unity"" in the party but neither he nor Mulayam Singh Yadav got the due respect under Akhilesh Yadav. ""I ask you all not to get involved in sycophancy. You will be free to point out if there is something wrong going on. I will allow this freedom in my party,"" he said.  Claiming extensive support for his political front, he said, ""There is an anti-people government at both the Centre and the state.

"BJP to Have its Own Version of Diwali in Poll-bound MP, Asks People to Light Lotus-Shaped Lamps ","Bhopal: This time, Diwali in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh will be celebrated differently — two weeks after its actual date. The ruling Bharatiya Janta Party has decided to observe ‘Kamal Deepawali’ — its own version of the festival — in which party workers will encourage households in the State to light lotus-shaped earthen lamps.  “Our party workers are making preparations for this event up to the booth level,” Rakesh Singh, BJP chief in MP, told the media persons on Tuesday. “Letters jointly written by CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and I will be given to households, urging them to celebrate Kamal Deepawali,” Singh said.  Asked if it will lead to a poll-code violation as MP is going to polls on November 28, the BJP leader said the celebration should not be linked with votes. “We only said every household should observe this festival with lotus symbol. “So I don’t think this breaches poll code in any manner.”  Justifying the move of celebrating Diwali a fortnight later, the BJP state president said: “Traditionally, we light lamps whenever there is an auspicious occasion around. So we decided to observe this festival in the atmosphere of delight and let people bless us in the elections.”  The party has also decided to launch a special campaign in order to reach out to beneficiaries of various government schemes from October 29 to November 1. “Divisional, mandal and booth-level meetings are being organised in this regard,"" he said, adding, ""The party will seek blessings from the public for 'Samriddh Madhya Pradesh’ during the campaign. The beneficiaries will be requested to give a missed call or send a Whatsapp message on the prescribed number,"" said Singh.  Last week, the State’s Congress chief Kamal Nath promised to “expose” chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan through 40 questions in as many days ahead of the Assembly elections.

"BJP May Drop Over Half of its MLAs in Rajasthan, Even Cabinet Ministers Not Guaranteed a Ticket ","Jaipur: The Bharatiya Janata Party is contemplating dropping more than half of its MLAs in Rajasthan in an attempt to protect its prospects from anti-incumbency, in what could be the largest ever-culling of incumbent legislators.   This was discussed at a three-day meet on the selection of candidates recently held in Jaipur, with Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje presiding over the meet. Sources said even cabinet ministers in the Rajasthan government are not guaranteed a ticket from their respective constituencies.  According to sources, multiple panels were set up and seat-wise discussion took place at the session, the second such discussion held ahead of the election. Opinions from local representatives, party workers and municipal councillors were taken over who could be a winning candidate from their respective seats in the upcoming elections.  The discussions were reportedly fraught with protests from party workers as multiple leaders staked a claim on candidature. On the final day, candidature for legislative seats from Jaipur city and Bharatpur region were discussed.   During the meet, BJP sought feedback from party delegates over sitting MLAs and on the chances of a repeat victory in their respective constituencies. The entire exercise was the first step in the preparation of the candidate list.   According to sources, BJP has sent a message to its cadres to ask for votes over the Lotus symbol of the party instead of the name of a local leader.   Sanganer constituency, where former BJP leader Ghanshyam Tiwari is an incumbent MLA, was a heavy topic of discussion and at least 12 BJP leaders sought to fight from the seat. Tiwari, a three-time MLA from the constituency, quit BJP in June and formed his own Bharat Vahini party.   According to sources, at least four leaders sought the ticket from Malviya Nagar constituency, where state Health Minister Kali Charan Saraf is a sitting MLA. However, dropping influential ministers and legislators from the candidate list could prove to be problematic for BJP.   During the discussions, leaders also deliberated over CM Raje running from Rajakhera constituency in Dholpur district. She currently represents Jhalrapatan in Jhalawar district in the Legislative Assembly and has been elected thrice as an MLA from the seat.   The candidate who emerges stronger in surveys and polls will be given a ticket, sources said. The first phase of discussions took place last week in Ranakpur, Pali district, where BJP deliberated over candidature on 102 seats. The remaining 98 seats were the topic of discussion in the second phase.  The election committee will now meet and deliberate over the panels set on 200 seats and decide the final list of candidates. The final nominations are expected to come after Diwali in November.",POLITICS
"National-level Opposition Alliance for 2019 Lok Sabha Polls Unlikely, Says Sharad Pawar ","Mumbai: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday indicated that a national level pre-poll opposition alliance for the 2019 general elections was unlikely but said he was trying to bring the non-BJP parties together on a common platform to defeat the ruling NDA.  Pawar also said any party in the Opposition getting the maximum seats after the Lok Sabha polls could claim prime ministership if the Modi government is unseated. ""I do not see the possibility of a uniform national alliance since the political situation on the ground varies from state to state. I am talking to different parties to bring them on a common platform,” Pawar said during an interaction with a news channel.  He said the current situation in the country was similar to the one in 2004. ""There will be change in government in Delhi and Maharashtra. No single party can provide an alternative. I do not think Narendra Modi will be prime minister after the Lok Sabha polls,"" he said.  Nobody thought Manmohan Singh would become the prime minister, but he gave a stable government for 10 years, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief said. ""(Former prime minister) Atal Bihari Vajpayee's stature in the BJP and the country was much bigger than Modi’s. Still there was a change. There is never a vacuum in politics. There will be an alternative even now,"" he observed.  On being asked whether the NCP would support Union minister Nitin Gadkari, who hails from Maharashtra, as prime minister if the BJP-led alliance retains power, Pawar said, ""I would not support anybody from the BJP"".  He also said leaders such as HD Deve Gowda and Inder Kumar Gujral became prime ministers by ""accident"" and he did not want to be part of ""accidents"".  Asked about former finance minister P Chidambaram's comment that the Congress will not project its president Rahul Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate, Pawar said what Chidambaram said was the Congress party's approach.  ""During all my interactions with Rahul Gandhi so far, I realised there was no insistence on being the PM candidate face, but only change of the present government,"" he said.  To a question on attempts to project the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as a ""Modi versus Gandhi contest"", Pawar said, ""That is the BJP's strategy which will not work"". Asked whether any failure by the opposition parties to have a national-level alliance was a disadvantage, the former Union minister said, ""there will not be much of a disadvantage"".  ""We should accept the dominance of Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh, Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal... After polls, the picture of who will lead the alliance will be clear from those who get maximum seats,"" he said. He also ruled out merging his party with the Congress.  Asked about the Modi government's performance, Pawar said people's expectations from the present dispensation were not fulfilled. ""What was promised in 2014 is not seen on the ground after four years. (Former prime minister) Manmohan Singh tried his best to give a good government, intentions were best. That is not the situation today.  ""If the present government was effective, there would not have been bribery charges at the highest level in the CBI....He (the prime minister) should act,"" he said.  Pawar said Modi was a strong leader for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but not for the country. On demands to bring a law for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, Pawar, in a veiled attack on the Centre, said” ""The issue has come up since the development agenda has failed"".  Pawar also attacked the Centre over the Rafale jet contract and demanded a probe into the deal with France by a joint parliamentary committee. ""There is room for suspicion. So there should be a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe. If the BJP stalled Parliament for three weeks for a JPC probe in (the) Bofors (case), why should the BJP, now in power, oppose a JPC?"" he said.  Asked if he felt there was corruption in the Rafale deal as alleged by Rahul Gandhi, Pawar said he had no information about it. ""I only know the aircraft is good. Rahul Gandhi may have more information than me about corruption,"" he said.",POLITICS
"JD(U) Says BJP Has Given a ‘Good Deal’ on Seat Sharing for 2019, But Not All Allies Like the Latest Formula ","Patna: Confusion among Bihar NDA allies over seat sharing for the Lok Sabha elections persisted with Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) reiterating on Tuesday it had negotiated a good deal with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP and Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party categorically denied any final understanding on the issue.  LJP parliamentary party leader Chirag Paswan told News18 that no final talks on seat sharing have taken place with the BJP. ""Two-three weeks back, BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav had started informal talks on seat sharing. However, it was stalled and we are waiting to resume discussion on this issue. I can't comment on news reports regarding what has transpired between the JD(U) and the BJP.”  Another ally RLSP also toed the line of LJP as its national general secretary Madhaw Anand told News18 that what JD(U) has said does not matter unless the BJP, being the largest ally, formally presents any formula on the negotiating table.  But Anand made it clear that his party won't accept two seats under any formula. ""We won three out of three seats in 2014 and our party has expanded its base since then. So there is no question of agreeing on two seats,"" he added.  On the other hand, a close associate of Nitish Kumar, reiterated that his party would either contest equal amount of seats or one less than the BJP in 2019.   “JD(U) has nothing to do with how many seats have been spared for RLSP and LJP. BJP has to deal with them. Whatever seats are left after accommodating them would be divided equally between BJP and JD(U). If leftover seats is an odd number then it will go to the BJP,"" he said.   He indicated if Kushwaha takes a different path then his two seats would be distributed among BJP and JD(U).   Going by JD(U)'s assertion, it appears BJP is ready to sacrifice more than two seats it won in 2014. According to the earlier 20-20 formula, the BJP, JD(U), LJP and RLSP were supposed to contest 20, 13, 5 and 2 seats respectively. The BJP won 22 out of 30 seats it contested in 2014.   However, Upendra Kushwha has throughout maintained that he will not accept two seats and would demand more than three, the number it contested in 2014. RLSP argues that it backed Narendra Modi as Prime Ministerial candidate when Nitish Kumar left the NDA and after his return to the fold it was BJP's responsibility to take care of their allies.   The party had directly blamed Nitish Kumar for creating confusion over seat sharing when he announced on September 16, while addressing party men in Patna, that he had sealed a Sammanjanak (respectful) deal with the BJP over seat sharing.  When asked about the latest murmuring on seat sharing, state BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said his party is determined to ensure a second term for Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. ""Our partly believes in cumulative effort and taking along all our allies in the state. We will not allow seat sharing to become a deterrent in our goal. A decision regarding this would be conveyed at an appropriate time,"" he said.",POLITICS
BJP Postpones Amit Shah's 'Rath Yatra' in Bengal to December 5 ,"Kolkata: The central leadership of the BJP has deferred a ""rath yatra"", to be led by its chief Amit Shah, in West Bengal by two days in view of the party's Assembly election campaigns in other states, sources in the saffron party said.  Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state general secretary Sayantan Basu said Shah will now kick off the ""yatra"" on December 5, instead of December 3, from the temple town of Tarapith in Birbhum.  Five states — Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Telangana and Chhattisgarh — are set to go to the polls between November 12 and December 7.  ""Taking the Assembly polls into consideration, the party has decided to reschedule the dates for the rath yatra in the state,"" a senior BJP leader said.  The ""yatra"" will be taken to all the 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state — three chariots covering 14 seats each — he added.  Sharing the programme details, Basu told PTI, ""The first rally will begin from Birbhum on December 5. The second and third rallies will start from Coochbehar district in the north and  Gangasagar in the south on December 7 and 9 respectively. Amit Shahji will be present at all the three rallies.""  The tableaus will stop at various places for public meetings and interactions, Basu said.  At the conclusion of the ""yatra"", the party planned to hold a massive rally in Kolkata, which was likely to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he added.  Sources in the saffron party said the decision to take out the ""rath yatra"" was taken during Shah's two-day visit to the state in June.  Buoyed by its performance in the last panchayat polls in West Bengal, the BJP has prepared its 2019 Lok Sabha election blueprint, targeting at least 22 parliamentary seats in the state.  ""Bengal is of immense importance to our party as people are fed up with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) regime. We need to win the maximum number of seats from east and northeast India, especially Bengal,"" another BJP leader said.  The saffron party currently has two Lok Sabha seats in Bengal — Asansol and Darjeeling.  Senior TMC leader and MP Abhishek Banerjee said his party was not bothered about the BJP taking out any ""yatra"" as the people of the state were with the ruling party.  ""Let them take out the rath yatra. The people of the state will defeat the divisive politics of the BJP,"" he added.",POLITICS
"Passed Over for Assam Gas Company Post, First-Time BJP MLA Quits Assembly ","Guwahati: First-time BJP MLA Terash Gowalla Tuesday said he has sent his resignation letter from the Assam Assembly to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.  The legislator from Duliajan constituency said he has sent his letter to Sonowal, who is the leader of the BJP Legislature Party in the state, on Monday night.  Confirming the development, a senior BJP party official said, ""Yes, he has sent the resignation to the CM's office on Monday.""  Asked about the reasons for resigning from the house, Gowalla said, ""There are various issues. I am not able to fulfill my duties as MLA. So, taking the moral responsibility, I am resigning from the Assembly.""  When pointed out that the issue of not offering him any post, particularly in Assam Gas Company Ltd (AGCL), during the recent appointments, Gowalla said, ""That is one reason. The AGCL is in Duliajan and people elected me as their representative. They had some expectations from me. However, without consulting me, the appointment in the company was made. I am not saying that you (government) give me the post, but at least I should have been consulted.""  Asked if there was any possibility of withdrawing the resignation under party pressure, Gowalla said, ""I have informed the issues to the CM. If I get a satisfactory answer, I may re-consider it.""  Gowalla told PTI he has not sent the letter to the Speaker, Hitendra Nath Goswami, which he will be doing after consulting the people of his constituency. When contacted, the Principal Secretary of the Assembly Secretariat, M K Deka said, they had not received any intimation about the MLA's resignation.  At present, the saffron party has 61 representatives in the 126-member Assembly.  Sonwal on Monday appointed various persons, including politicians from the BJP, AGP and BPF, as chairman, vice chairman and directors of 40 government-run bodies.   This included appointment of Sadiya MLA Bolin Chetia as chairperson and Indra Gogoi as the vice chairperson of Assam Gas Company Ltd.  Terming it as ""very unfortunate"", Congress spokesperson Rhituporna Konwar said, ""It is nothing but opportunistic politics"".  When people are worried about their own identity and a conglomerate of organisations have called an Assam Bandh, Gowalla resigned for his own benefit.  ""The BJP MLA had sought peoples' mandate as a legislator only to serve the constituency and not to be appointed as chairman of AGCL or any other company post,"" the Congress leader said.",POLITICS
"Gunvant Patidar, Man Who Brokered Mandsaur Peace Deal, Quits BJP Ahead of Madhya Pradesh Polls ","Bhopal: Gunvant Patidar, who bailed out the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government during the farmers' stir in Mandsaur last year, not only quit the BJP ahead of Assembly elections but also alleged harassment by police at the behest of the ruling party.  The young leader confirmed the development to News18, saying he resigned from the BJP around three days ago as the party failed to help the distressed farmers.  Patidar on Monday submitted a complaint to the district collector and the SP that he was abused and threatened by SHO of Narayangarh over phone on the intervening night of October 21 and 22.  “If the administration fails to act upon my complaint, I am open to move court,” he claimed.  The Collector said that an inquiry will be conducted in the matter.  “Patidar has submitted a written complaint and call records of the said incident. He has also submitted an online complaint to Election Commission of India. An inquiry would be carried out in this issue,” Mandsaur Collector OP Shrivastava said.  Patidar further expressed disappointment over the fact that a clean chit was given to the cops guilty of gunning down farmers which was an injustice to those killed in the stir.  Patidar, who is associated with Naujawan Kisan Sabha which is part of All India Kisan Co-ordination Committee, denied any possibility of him joining the Congress. He, however, categorically accused the Modi government at the Centre of duping farmers by not fulfilling the promises made during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.  “If Congress or any other party makes concrete promises for farmers, we can think about extending support in elections,” said Patidar.  The 38-year-old had got elected for the post of Zila Panchayat vice president as an independent in 2015 but had later joined the BJP.  In 2017, Gunvant Patidar was assigned to force a compromise between the aggrieved farmers and the state government, after the government failed to reach out to the farmers.  Gunvant Patidar, along with other BJP leaders, accompanied the kin of farmers killed in the June 6 Mandsaur firing to meet Shivraj Singh Chouhan on June 10 when the CM sat on an indefinite fast in the aftermath of violence triggered by farmers' stir.  In the past, Patidar has been accused of his involvement in opium smuggling. A local court in Mandsaur had punished him with five year' imprisonment and fine on charges of opium smuggling, but the high court had later granted him bail.",POLITICS
"Kerala CM Vijayan Lashes Out at BJP, RSS for Violent Protests in Sabarimala ","Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday attacked the BJP and RSS for the violent agitation at the Lord Ayyappa temple complex in Sabarimala over the entry of women of all ages into the hill shrine.  The agitation was a ""planned and deliberate attempt"" to create an atmosphere of tension in the state, Vijayan told reporters here.  The incidents of preventing women in the 10-50 age group from offering worship at the temple and attacking media personnel, who had come to cover the historic event, was part of a conspiracy led by the RSS, he alleged.  The government has the constitutional responsibility of implementing the Supreme Court verdict permitting women of all ages to offer prayers at the Sabarimala temple and no attempt to convert the complex into a ""war zone"" would be allowed, he said.  The temple in Sabarimala had witnessed high drama and tense moments for six days when it was opened for monthly prayers from October 17 to 22.  While maintaining that the faith of believers would be respected, Vijayan made it clear that the government had the responsibility to implement the court order.  He also charged that a ""heinous attempt"" was made by the Sangh parivar to communalise the state police, apparently referring to the cyber attack faced by IGPs Manoj Abraham and S Sreejith, who had been deputed to the temple to maintain law and order.  Vijayan also criticised the temple tantri, Kandararu Rajeevaru, who had said he would close the temple and go if women were allowed inside the shrine and the agitation by assistants of priests who had protested near the holy 18 steps.",POLITICS
"Video Showing CM Shivraj as Dushasan, Kamal Nath as Krishna Irks BJP ","Bhopal: With Assembly elections round the corner, spoof videos are flooding social media accounts in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh.  The latest video makes a satire of Mahabharata, in which chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is depicted as Dushasan, the younger brother of Duryodhan, and Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath as Lord Krishna.  The morphed video also depicts senior BJP leaders, including Kailash Vijayvargiya, Narottam Mishra and Bhopal mayor Alok Sharma, as Kauravas.  The 1.10 minutes-video shows the Draupadi ‘Chir Haran' episode.  Chouhan’s ‘Dushasan’ tries to disrobe Draupadi in a crowded court. Kamal Nath is shown as the queen’s savior Lord Krishna.  Objecting to the satire, BJP leaders complained to the Election Commission. “We have ordered a probe and issued instructions for appropriate action,” chief election officer VL Kantarao said.  The spoof war had kicked off after a video where CM Shivraj was shown as Angad had gone viral. In the same video, Kamal Nath was depicted as Ravana and other Congress leaders as his kin.  In the subsequent months, several other parody videos mocking both the BJP and the Congress did the rounds on social media.",POLITICS
"Rahul, Akhilesh, Tejashwi Working on 'Strategy of Encirclement' to Checkmate PM Modi in 2019 Polls ","New Delhi: Congress president Rahul Gandhi views the grand old party as a feminine one, not in the Western sense of the word, but as more liberal and sensitive than the masculine, toxic, 56-inch chest thumping BJP, says a new book on young politicians.   In a soon-to-be released ‘The Contenders’ (Simon & Schuster) popular political talk show host Priya Sahgal profiles 16 emerging politicians with a prediction from veteran columnist Vir Sanghvi in the foreword that at least one among the 16 profiled in the book would be prime minister one day.   The author claims that Rahul, Akhilesh Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav and a number of other young guns are working on a “strategy of encirclement” to checkmate Narendra Modi-led NDA in the 219 Lok Sabha polls.   Priya’s profile of Rahul Gandhi is most engaging and insightful. It gives a rare glimpse of Rahul’s line of thinking in the context of his future role and strategy. Throughout her writings on present and generation-next of political parties such as Ram Madhav, Yogi Adityanath, Omar Abdullah, Akhilesh Yadav, Jayant Choudhury, Arvind Kejriwal, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Himanta Biswa Sarma, Kanhimozhi, Anurag Thakur, Harsimat Kaur Badal, Sachin Pilot, Tejashwi Yadav, Asaduddin Owaisi and Milind Deora, Priya remains remarkably non-judgmental, dispassionate yet astute observer of their political life. Her trait as a regular gossip writer takes a backseat as the book curiously avoids talking about personal scandals and some credible rumours.   According to the author, Rahul’s thrust on the Congress having feminine persona, has roots in the union of Shiv-Shakti where the qualities of both genders work in tandem to create a universe that is sustainable and well-balanced.   Priya recalls one of her initial one-on-one meetings with Rahul Gandhi when the UPA was in power and Dr Manmohan Singh had offered the young Gandhi a place in his government. “Rahul told me that he works according to no one’s timelines but his own. Rahul has certainly remained consistent to that line of thought. Impatient Congressmen may want him to be more aggressive and hungry for power, but he took his time to sip from the ‘poisoned’ chalice,” Priya reminiscences, adding, “he [Rahul] explained that he was not going to assume any responsibility just because it was expected of him. He would take charge only when he felt he was ready. Some would call this arrogance, others diffidence. In either case, it didn’t make the leadership manual.”   In the present context, Rahul is said to be working on a two-fold strategy to take on the BJP. The short term plan for 2019 is designed with the sole purpose of checkmating prime minister Narendra Modi at any cost. In other words, in Rahul’s scheme of things, it means being the smaller partner in some states during the coming round of general elections. Rahul’s sense is that non-NDA opposition parties are rather unanimous in not projecting any leader against Modi for they realise that to do so would be to fall into the BJP’s trap. The non-NDA opposition leaders feel that despite all their potential and promise, no young or seasoned leader from the Opposition is in a position to match Modi. “It’s better to fight him on issues,” Priya quotes Tejashwi Yadav and Jayant Choudhury as saying, “This is how we will cut them [NDA] down to size. We will not talk about personalities. It’s not one personality taking them on; in UP you have me, Akhilesh and Mayawati. If all of us come together and say the same thing, then it’s a strategy of encirclement.”  Rahul’s long term goal for 2024 is different. The Congress president hopes to establish himself as a credible prime ministerial face by then. Priya thinks Rahul will gain from 12 states, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat, which will help the Congress improve its tally in 2019. If the Congress crosses the hundred mark, she argues, Rahul’s short term plan will be in practice giving the Congress a relevant role in any anti-BJP coalition or as a more sure-footed leader of the opposition in parliament.   ‘The Contenders’ offers interesting debate around “youth” in Indian politics. Vir Sanghvi, in his usual candid style, points out how most “young” politicians in India are actually older than David Cameron who was 47 when he stepped down as prime minister of UK. “Put bluntly, India is a country of the young, ruled by the old and the very old. Something like 50 per cent of India’s population is in its twenties. And 65 per cent of the population is under 35. Yet, you will search in vain for a single minister who is under 35 in most Indian Cabinets,” Sanghvi says while giving a rationale that it has something to do with the circumstances that prevailed when India won Independence in 1947. The leaders of the newly free nation were people who had led the struggle for liberation from the British. Because it had been a long, hard battle, they were already quite old or at the very least, middle-aged, by the time they took office in the first government of free India.  Rahul’s long term goal for 2024 is different. The Congress president hopes to establish himself as a credible prime ministerial face by then.",POLITICS
TRS Facing the Heat on Campaign Trail But Brand KCR Might Come to the Rescue ,"Last week, a former TRS minister in Telangana who was campaigning ahead of the Assembly elections in the state was gheraoed by a mob of farmers. The angry crowd stopped his car and refused to listen to him. What followed next was a halt in the campaign due to the chaos.  The incident happened in Wanaparthy district in Telangana. The farmers wanted an assurance from the minister that adequate water would be provided for irrigation.  This is not the first time Jupally Krishna Rao, Minister for Rural Development, was mobbed by people. Previously, he had to get on top of his car to pacify the angry crowd.  In the last one month, there have been at least seven such incidents where Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leaders, have faced backlash while on campaign trail. With villages taking oath to boycott elections and asking leaders to sign a bond saying that the promises would be fulfilled—the ruling party leaders are facing the heat.  Earlier this month, a farmer from Narnoor mandal in Adilabad district, committed suicide due to crop failure. Her husband had to carry her on his shoulders to cross a stream to reach the hospital. Sadly, the woman died.  A week later, residents of the mandal protested with banners saying “No roads, no bridges, then why vote? Do not come to our village asking for votes.”  In another incident, people from Wardhanapet in Warangal, protested against the local TRS candidate Aroori Ramesh for lack of development. Slogans were raised saying “You have no right to ask for our vote.”  These incidents are definitely a setback to the party ahead of the elections in December. With the anti-incumbency factor gaining momentum, it is not going to be an easy ride this time, say analysts.  But, will caretaker chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao’s image come to the rescue? Probably yes, say political analysts in the state.  “At the grassroots, the local leaders’ performance might not be satisfying, but TRS will have an edge due to KCR and his brand name,” Prof Nageshwar Rao, a political analyst, told News18.  The Chief Minister, time and again, has expressed confidence that the party would easily win at least 100 of the 119 seats. He had also said, last month, that the TRS had fulfilled all the promises made in the previous manifesto.  What came as a relief and a boost to the TRS candidates is the partial manifesto released last week. The manifesto, this time, includes allowance for unemployed youth, a higher pension pay, apart from the loan waiver. Analysts believe that the latest promises will give the campaign a boost and help the candidates in fielding questions on the ground.  Also, the opposition has not been able to galvanise the discontent into an anti-KCR narrative, which is another advantage of the TRS, apart from the chief minister’s flamboyant image, adds Nageshwar Rao.  What worked well for KCR in 2014 was the separate Telangana agitation. The fight for a separate state, in which he was at the forefront, helped him gain support from masses.  But, now, the situation is different. The focus is on the promises made and how much of it has been a reality? The questions is, are people of the state ready to give KCR another chance? Most likely yes, say analysts.  “The anti-KCR narrative is building, but I don’t think that is the situation as of now,” added Nageshwar Rao.  Telangana will go for polls on December 7 and the counting will follow on the 11th of the same month.",POLITICS
‘Even If a Tsunami Strikes…’: Panneerselvam on Rumours of Rift With Palaniswami ,"Pudukottai (TN): Dismissing reports of any fissures between him and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami, deputy hief minister O Panneerselvam Monday said not even a tsunami can create problems between them.  Charging the opposition parties with trying to drive a wedge between him and Palaniswami, Panneerselvam said any such attempts from ""within and outside"" would not fructify. Panneerselvam is AIADMK coordinator while Palaniswami the joint coordinator.  ""Even if a tsunami strikes, the opposition parties cannot create a problem between us. We are determined and treading the path of ideals laid down by MGR and Amma,"" he said at a marriage function here.  AIADMK founder, former chief minister MG Ramachandran is addressed as MGR while his protege and former CM J Jayalalithaa is Amma (mother) for the party supporters.   Panneerselvam's assertion comes weeks after his rival and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam founder TTV Dinakran made a sensational disclosure that former chief minister Panneerselvam wanted to oust the Palaniswami government with his assistance and had therefore met him last year.  Dinakaran had said Panneerselvam wanted to meet him as he regretted revolting against deposed party leader VK Sasikala and his subsequent criticism against the family.  However, Panneerselvam has denied Dinakaran's accusation that he wanted to dethrone Palaniswami and take over as chief minister, saying he has held the office thrice and was content.  He had, however, admitted he met Dinakaran last July as claimed by the latter, but only with the hope that the AMMK leader would have been a 'reformed' man.",POLITICS
"BJP is Now Using Goddess Durga Against Me, Says Kanhaiya Kumar ","Patna: Former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar has shifted focus from Delhi to Bihar after the Communist Party of India (CPI) informally announced to field him from the Begusarai Lok Sabha Constituency, which is also his home district, in the next general elections.   Camping in Begusarai, he could be seen inaugurating Kabaddi tournaments, attending religious functions and seeking support for the October 25 'Bhaajpa Bhagao Desh Bachao' rally to be held at the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna.   However, controversies continue to dog Kanhaiya. During his Bihar sojourn, he has already been booked on three accounts — intimidating doctors and creating ruckus inside AIIMS, Patna, attempt to murder and inciting riots around a Durga puja pandal in Begusarai, and hurting religious sentiments of Hindus in his speech.  Kanhaiya, though, is unfazed and prepared for the long haul. He labelled the attack by the BJP to project him as anti-Hindu before elections. The young leader spoke to News18 about recent controversies related to him and his political strategy.  Here are the edited excerpts from the interview:   Q: You claim your convoy was attacked on October 16 at Bhagwanpur in Begusarai. What happened? Kanhaiya Kumar: We were returning from Mansoorchak after attending a rally. I was attacked near Dahia village under Bhagwanpur police station area by the supporters of the BJP's youth wing and the Bajrang Dal. You can easily identify them. They have uploaded pictures with Sushil Modi on their social media accounts. The attackers were patronised by a local BJP MLC Rajneesh. The intention was to cause harm to me and my colleagues.  Q: Is it correct that you were not stopped by them but you got off there to meet one of your acquaintances which resulted in a traffic jam in front of a puja pandal? Kanhaiya Kumar: No. They are two different issues. The puja pandal was behind us. There was quite a distance between where we stopped and the place of the puja. A police escort party was with us. You can ask them.   Q: Locals told me that your followers, armed with iron rods and hockey sticks, attacked them. They also say that your comment on Goddess Durga was in bad taste? Kanhaiya Kumar: Can you expect that a person who is starting out in politics will indulge in such things? And that too in his own constituency. These are all lies. And those you are referring to as locals are not common people but workers of the BJP and the Bajrang Dal. This was a politically motivated attack to tarnish my image and project me as anti-Hindu. They conspired to vitiate social harmony.  And one of the guys who was beaten up is not an apolitical person, but a member of the Bajrang Dal. Had we been armed, then 40-50 people would have been injured not one.   Q: How can you be sure that they were people from the RSS and the BJP? Kanhaiya Kumar: Because common people in Dahia village are least concerned about this. The BJP workers are fanning the fire. You need to understand the history of Dahia village. I know very well because my ancestral home is just about a few kilometres away. Some families there have been with the RSS for a long time. Bhagwanpur Chowk is the only stronghold of the Bajrang Dal in Begusarai. All their senior leaders were at the spot just after five minutes. How can this be possible?  Q: What happened at AIIMS, Patna? Kanhaiya Kumar: We went there to meet our AISF colleague Sushil. The hospital says I was with hundreds of supporters who scuffled with security guards and I misbehaved with doctors. Now my question is where is the CCTV footage? What is the evidence? If somebody was injured then where is the injury report? See, it's a conspiracy. The official Facebook page of AIIMS, Patna, describes me as 'anti-national Kanhaiya'. Can you expect a government body to brand me in such a way? The doctors who filed an FIR against me are associated with the BJP.  Q: Bihar's health minister and senior BJP leader Mangal Pandey has warned you saying Bihar is not JNU. What is your reaction? Kanhaiya Kumar: Sometime back the same Mangal Pandey said he is not aware about any Kanhaiya Kumar. Now he is saying, “Be cautious, it's not JNU but Bihar. How was he able to identify me now? I have not developed any family relationship with him.” The FIR was lodged by the doctors against me at his behest. MLC Rajneesh touches his feet whose goons attacked me in Begusarai.  Q: How can you say everywhere people are conspiring against you? Kanhaiya Kumar: This is for everyone to see. Lawyers were manipulated against me in courts, doctors were influenced to file a case, the Vice Chancellor of JNU was tasked to scuttle my PhD and now the BJP is using Goddess Durga against me. But I am not afraid.  Q: What is the difference between campus and electoral politics? What is the kind of feedback that you are getting in Begusarai? Kanhaiya Kumar: The people here in Begusarai are clever. No one can fool them. When sedition charges were slapped against me then also they stood behind me. None can mislead them. I will continue my political journey following the rule of the law. My opponents first tried to brand me as an anti-national and are now trying to prove that I a ‘goonda (hoodlum)’.   I will continue to follow the path I chose in the JNU campus. I will not compromise with principles. They (BJP) were defeated in the JNU and will face the same fate in Begusarai.   ",POLITICS

While Girwar Janghel will contest from Khairagarh seat, Bhuneshwar Singh Baghel will contest from Dongargarh-SC seat and Daleshwar Sahu from Dongargaon assembly constituency. The party has also fielded Channi Sahu from Khujji seat and Indra Shah Mandavi from Mohla-Manpur (ST) seat.  The Congress has declared candidates for all 18 seats that will go to polls in the first phase. The candidates for remaining 72 seats that will go to polls in the second phase are yet to be declared.  The former PM's niece has been vocal in her criticism of the Raman Singh government and had also accused the BJP of politicising Vajpayee's death by carrying his ashes across India for electoral gains in 2019.   ""The way BJP is carrying the ashes of Atal Bihari Vajpayee around the country, it is a show off and for votes. Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh and his cabinet never remembered him until now, especially when he had created the state,"" she had told News18.   Shukla, who previously represented Janjgir as Member of Parliament and remained an MLA in undivided Madhya Pradesh, had left the BJP in 2013 after accusing the party of torturing her ‘mentally’. This had ended her three-decade association with the party.   She had contested the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Bilaspur on a Congress ticket, but had lost to BJP’s Lakhan Lal Sahu of BJP from Bilaspur.  For Shukla, it would be the toughest test in her political career as CM Raman Singh is seeking a fourth consecutive term as CM after ousting Congress' Ajit Jogi from power in 2003.  The Congress is out of power in Chhattisgarh for the last 15 years. The BJP has so far announced candidates for 78 seats, including the 18 going to the polls in the first phase. October 23 is the last day of filing nominations for first phase.",POLITICS
Rapes of Minor Girls Increased by 249% in MP: Kamal Nath Corners CM Shivraj on Women Safety Ahead of Polls ,"Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath, who has promised to “expose” chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan through 40 questions ahead of the Assembly elections, on Monday launched a scathing attack on Chouhan, alleging a serious surge crimes against women in MP since 2003.  “Under the BJP rule, rape cases of minor girls have risen by 249 per cent. In 2004, as many as 710 cases of rapes were reported in MP and 2,479 such cases were reported in 2016,” Nath claimed in one of his tweets on Monday, adding that 17,986 minor girls were assaulted sexually during the tenure of Chouhan.  “Over 25,000 women have been abducted and 46,317 rape cases have been reported in MP between 2004 and 2016,” Nath alleged. In the 13-year rule of CM Chouhan, 2,41,535 women have been subjected to various crimes, claimed the Congress president, adding that crimes against women have surged by 74.99 per cent from 2004 to 2016.  Attributing the findings to National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) report of Ministry of Home Affairs, Auditor Genera report and NFHS-4, Nath said the women of Madhya do not enjoy a safe environment as over 27,000 women ended their lives between 2004-2016 due to harassment, financial troubles and depression. Over 93,000 females suffered molestation in MP in this period, he added.  Convictions in crimes against women, too, are at an all-time low, Nath said, highlighting the 6,733 cases that are pending before various courts in MP since 2004 and atrocities on women have increased by 1,168 per cent. He said there are 85, 383 cases pending in courts since 2016.  He also blamed the Chouhan government pf poor prosecution, which, he said, led to only 27.8 per cent criminals getting punished in cases related to crimes against women. The MP government, Nath said, has allotted Rs 27,590 crore for Women and Child Development since 2004-05, but Rs 5,402 crore still remains unused.",POLITICS
'Being a Neta's Son is Not Anyone's Fault': BJP Gen Secy 'Defends' Dynastic Politics ,"Bhopal: Bharatiya Janata Party, a party that vehemently opposes dynastic politics in India, found itself in a tight spot on Monday when its national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said that being a politician's son should not be considered a demerit. The statement comes at a time when Vijayvargiya's son Akash is lobbying for a ticket in Madhya Pradesh.  When asked whether children of various senior politicians in MP, including his son Akash, should be considered for an election ticket by the party, Vijayvargiya said that it was up to the party to select a deserving candidate. ""The party should see the duration for which an aspirant has been working for it. The work should matter and not the political lineage as being a politician's son is not anyone's fault,"" he said.  If someone is a deserving candidate, then the party would consider his candidature, said the Mhow MLA.  Asked about whether he would contest assembly or the Lok Sabha polls, Vijayvargiya said he would follow whatever the party instructs him to.  The response from Vijayvargiya has come at a time when there is strong political buzz that his son Akash, who has been taking care of his poll ventures for long, could be fielded from Mhow and Vijayvargiya could opt for any seat in Indore or anywhere else in Malwa region where he enjoys sizable sway. Besides, Akash, several other senior leader’s sons are in the fray for election tickets in MP.  Meanwhile the senior leader discussing about Samriddha MP campaign, which the BJP has launched on Sunday, claimed the party received over 4000 phone calls besides Whatsapp messages of suggestions from the public on the first day of campaign carried out by 50 chariots in 50 districts.  Asked whether these 4,000 calls could also be considered an example that the state was plagued by problems, the BJP general secretary asked the media not to think by a negative perspective claiming it were all suggestions pertaining to Samriddha MP. To a pointed query as to why the BJP shifted focus from a Golden MP to Samriddha MP, a seemingly perturbed Vijayvargiya retorted saying it was matter of only perspective. When the MP would be Samriddha, it would be Swarnim (golden) also, he added.   Questioned as to when the BJP would start going to polls underlining its own achievements rather than talking about Congress government failures, Vijayvargiya said the benchmark would be the same even if BJP fights consecutive tenth election in MP. “We would still be comparing our government with Congress government of 1993 to 2003.”  He briefed the media about a meeting chaired by organizational general secretary Ram Lal in which the party discussed the election work blueprint as directed by party chief Amit Shah during his visit earlier. “Assessment is being made about areas where PM Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah and union ministers’ visits are required during campaigning,” he said. Senior leader Prabhat Jha has been assigned the task of preparing list of places where PM’s visits were required.  Replying to a query whether party patriarch LK Advani would also be invited for public meetings, Vijayvargiya said, “Yes, he would come, if the need be.”",POLITICS
"Mehul Choksi Deposited Lakhs in Bank Account of Jaitley's Daughter, FM Let the 'Thief' Flee: Rahul Gandhi ","New Delhi: The Congress on Monday accused the Narendra Modi government of conniving with fraudsters who had escaped the country and claimed ""conflict of interest"" to demand the sacking of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, saying his daughter and son-in-law, both lawyers, allegedly received a retainership of Rs 24 lakh from fugitive Mehul Choksi.   Referring to the finance minister as ‘Jaitlie’, party president Rahul Gandhi tweeted that his daughter was on the payroll of “thief Mehul Choksi” when her “FM daddy sat on his file & allowed him to flee.” He used the hashtag - #ArunJaitlieMustResign - with the tweet.   ""You must have heard about Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, who had stolen Rs 35,000 crore of the country. Choksi deposited lakhs of rupees in the bank account of FM Arun Jaitleys daughter,"" the Congress leader claimed at a rally in Raipur in poll-bound Chhattisgarh.   He said the Finance Minister ""did not take any action against Choksi following which he fled the country, adding that Congress leaders gave details of these transactions in Delhi.   At a press conference in the capital, Sachin Pilot said Jaitley’s daughter Sonali and son-in-law Jaiyesh Bakhshi had accepted a retainership of Rs 24 lakh from Choksi's company Gitanjali Gems Ltd in December 2017.   “Is this not a clear-cut case of Collusion, Connivance' & Conflict of Interest' on part of FM Arun Jaitley? Why were FM Jaitley, his daughter and son-in-law neither summoned nor questioned by CBI/ED/SFIO?"" he asked, adding that was it not a fit case to sack Jaitley and conduct a full independent investigation.  Jaitley's son-in-law, however, has earlier issued a statement stating that his law firm had returned the retainership the moment they came to know that the company was involved in a scam. The finance minister has not yet responded to the latest allegations.   Pilot sought to know why no action was taken against Mehul Choksi, Nirav Modi, Geetanjali Gems Ltd and others, despite FIRs and multiple complaints. ""Who protected them?"" they asked.  “Why were daughter and son-in-law of FM Arun Jaitley paid Rs.24 lakh by Mehul Choksi's Gitanjali Gems Ltd. without doing any work, as admitted by them? Who else are the clients of Chambers of Jaitley & Associates' paying retainership of lakhs of rupees and why should their names not be made public, including amounts received?”  ""As people who owed money to Mehul Choksi/Nirav Modi came forward & deposited the money with Govt after their fraudulent escape, why did FM Jaitley's daughter & son-in-law redeposit Rs.24 Lakh in the account of a company that had defrauded the banks & people of Rs 26,306 Cr? Why did they hide it?"" the statement from the three leaders said.   The Congress further alleged that in the 44 months till January 2018, the Modi government witnessed an unprecedented 19,000 'bank fraud cases' involving Rs 90,000 crore.  Pilot said 23 fraudsters escaped India under the government's watch after duping the country of over Rs 53,000 crore. He said a sinking economy, banking frauds and flying fraudsters form part of BJP's-Jaitley's 'New India' and demanded that the minister should resign on moral grounds.   ""Successive escapes of Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and others reflect that Modi government is not a guardian of public money' but a travel agency' facilitating fraud, fleece and fly to foreign shores' of willful bank defaulters,"" the party said in a statement.",POLITICS
"BJP Minister Subhash Deshmukh Accused of ‘Milking’ Govt for Rs 24 Crore, Taking Funds for Fake Factory ","Mumbai: Maharashtra’s state minister for Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh, who has previously been accused of scams, is in the eye of the storm again. This time, he has been accused by the Congress of forging documents and fabricating permissions for extracting funds from the government for a fake milk processing factory, which allegedly did not exist. Congress has claimed that the BJP minister and his son have duped the National Agricultural Department Program of Rs 24.81 crore.  “He has no right to remain a minister in the State government. He should resign immediately. He is clearly a scamster. He has abused his constitutional authority and defrauded the Government of Maharashtra. He has taken advantage of his position and authorities for personal benefits time and again,” said Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam.  Lokmangal Multi-State co-operative Society limited, the co-operative body in question, is chaired by Subhash Deshmukh’s son Rohan Deshmukh.  Documents accessed by an RTI activist (a copy of which is in possession of CNN News18), show that various government agencies including the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, Food and Drug Administration department, Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Public Works Department, Industrial Security and Health Department, have denied granting any permission to Lokmangal Multi-State co-operative Society Limited.  As per a letter dated July 2, 2018, the milk collection supervisor inspected the milk cold storage facility at Bibidarphal and milk processing units in Karmala, Sangola and Mangalvedha on June 26, and found that the factories were not processing even a single litre of milk. The letter stated, “The milk cold storage and processing facility of Lokmangal Multi-State co-operative society in Bibidarphal in Solapur is completely shut down at present. I attach herewith the inspection report of the Milk Collection Supervisor,” the District Information Officer said in his letter.  The set of documents show that Deshmukh’s co-operative society appended a letter of permission allegedly issued by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board on April 22, 2014, giving consent for the manufacture of processed milk to the capacity of 1 lakh litre per day. But when the RTI activist wrote to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board in 2018, it sent a written reply, saying no such permissions were granted by it to Lokmangal Co-operative society.  “We found that each and every permission was completely fabricated. The minister and his son showed false certificates of permission from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Deputy Divisional Engineer of the Public Works Department and Food and Drug Administration. These documents were submitted to the Maharashtra government to get funds under the National Agriculture Department Program,” Nirupam said.  “This is an old issue. We haven’t taken a single rupee till date. Making allegations is everybody’s right in a democracy. But I deny these allegations. They are totally false and baseless,” Subhash Deshmukh told CNN News18.",POLITICS
"From Shahabuddin's Den Siwan, Tejashwi Signals He’ll Follow in Footsteps of Father Lalu Yadav ","Siwan: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Monday visited the ancestral home of gangster-turned-politician Mohammad Shahabuddin before leaving for a rally with his wife Hena Shahab in Siwan, where the writ of the incarcerated leader still runs large.  Spearheading the second leg of his Samvidhan Bachao Nyay Yatra, largely aimed against the BJP, the leader of opposition in the state signalled with the move that he would continue to follow the footsteps of his father and RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav, considering Shahabuddin's influence over minority votes in the state.  Before his conviction in the fodder scam, Lalu Yadav, amid a lot of hue and cry, had named Hena Shahab as a member of RJD's working committee. Shahab contested but lost the last Lok Sabha election to BJP's Om Prakash Yadav.  By all calculations Tejashwi has decided to field her again in 2019, one of the RJD spokesmen told News18.   ""That's why he is toeing the line of his father Lalu Yadav who always backed Shahabuddin, even after he was shown giving a verbal dose to the Siwan SP on the instructions of the Don in a sting operation last year. His steadfast support to Shahabuddin has played a key role in getting their support,"" he said.  Shahabuddin and his henchmen had murdered two sons of Chanda Babu in 2004 by drenching them in acid at the same Pratappur residence where Tejashwi held a closed-door meeting with Hena and party supporters on Monday. Shahabuddin and his three associates were sentenced to life in that case.   Chanda Babu later became an icon of resistance against Mohammad Shahabuddin as he continued his legal fight defying alleged threats from the gangster’s men. His third son, who was an eyewitness to the case, was also killed in 2014. While the opposition BJP hailed his courage and many of its leaders visited him, the RJD kept its distance from the family.  As Tejashwi discussed poll strategy and well-being of Shahabuddin's family with Hena and other party supporters at her residence, media was kept outside the residential premises.  Flanked by Hena, Tejashwi vowed to root out the BJP from the state in the next assembly election while addressing a public rally at Gandhi Maidan. A large crowed, by some accounts more than the BJP managed in a recently held Atal Yuva Sankalp Sammelan attended by Smriti Irani, assembled to hear the Lalu scion who attacked RSS more than his bete noir Nitish Kumar.",POLITICS
"BJP May Deny Tickets to Many MLAs in Rajasthan, MP to Stave Off Anti-incumbency ","New Delhi: The BJP is likely to deny tickets to many sitting MLAs in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the two states it had swept in 2013 but where it is now facing a renewed challenge from the Congress, in a bid to stave off any anti-incumbency in the assembly polls, party sources said.  They said the party may also not give tickets to three more sitting MLAs in Chhattisgarh, where it is yet to name candidates for 13 seats including four held by it. The party has already denied tickets to 14 of the 49 legislators who had won last time.  The sources also played down surveys predicting an edge for the Congress in Rajasthan, and asserted that there may have been some ""communication gap"" within the party earlier but things have changed.  ""We will come to power in all three states,"" a party leader claimed. Though he did not elaborate on the likely number of MLAs the party may not field in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, he said such a decision would be based on feedback from organisation and independent assessment carried out by the party.  Political observers say denying tickets to the MLAs seen to be unpopular in their constituencies may help the party placate voters to some extent.  BJP sources said Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan remains a popular leader and the first choice of the state's voters for the top post.  ""In such a scenario when the main face of the government is popular, any so called anti-incumbency can be effectively countered with some measures, including dropping unpopular MLAs,"" they said.  The BJP, especially after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and its president Amit Shah's ascent to leadership, has relied on intensive fieldwork to select its candidates. It has not shied away from dropping any incumbent lawmaker, who, it believes, may have become a liability or whose replacement has a better prospect at the hustings.  In the 230-member Madhya Pradesh assembly and 200-member Rajasthan assembly, the BJP had won 165 and 163 seats respectively in the 2013 polls. The party has been in power in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, whose assembly has 90 members, since 2003 while Rajasthan has an over two-decade-old history of voting out the incumbent party.",POLITICS
"Raje's Gaurav Yatra Will Turn Out to be Her Vidaai Yatra, Says Ashok Gehlot ","Jaipur: AICC general secretary and former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot Monday said the BJP must clarify who was the face in the upcoming Assembly elections in the state Chief Minister Vasudhara Raje or the BJP's symbol, which, he said, was forgotten in 2014 when the party adopted the ""Abki Baar Modi Sarkar"" slogan.  He said the BJP had earlier presented the face of Chief Minister Raje for the forthcoming Assembly elections but now they have shifted towards the party symbol ""Kamal ka Phool"".   ""'Kamal ka phool' was forgotten (in 2014-Lok sabha elections) when the BJP gave the slogan 'Abki Baar Modi Sarkar' instead of 'BJP sarkar'. The party earlier presented Raje's face for the election but now they are for the lotus symbol. The BJP president should clarify his stand,"" Gehlot said, while accusing the saffron party of misleading people for seeking votes.  Asked about his recent comment that nobody ""knows before-hand who will become Kaun Banega crorepati"" in response to a question on who would be the chief minister if the party won, he said, ""the game has not begun yet"".   Gehlot also accused the state government of weakening the MGNREGA and making no arrangements in view of a likely drought.   ""The CM is not focusing on villages affected by drought and is busy making hollow announcements,"" he said.  He also said the government had failed to manage the situation of seasonal diseases in the state.  Gehlot said the fair price shops were distributing slips with the lotus flower printed on it, the point of sale (PoS) machines had the symbol as well, the Bhamashah card has the CM's photo and mobile phones are distributed under the Bhamashah digital family in violation of the code of conduct.  He said the law and order situation was deteriorating and incidents of rape, dacoity, and theft were on rise.   Gehlot targeted Raje and said her 'Gaurva Yatra' will become her vidaii yatra. People are resentful. First time, I have seen that employees of various departments are on strike and the CM is waiting for the code of conduct to get rid of them. In such situations, nothing will happen even if Modi comes, Amit Shah makes visit or the CM takes out the Vidai (farewell) Yatra,"" Gehlot alleged.  He said the Raje government started with PPP (public private partnership) and will end with PPP.  ""Resurgent Rajasthan was a drama. I had stated that time that it is not being organised to bring investments but to hold a get-together for industrialists. Raje should clarify how much investment came and how many jobs were created because of Resurgent Rajasthan,"" he said.",POLITICS

Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 Smartphone Processor Launched: Everything You Need to Know ,"While high-end devices in the smartphone industry, like the Samsung Galaxy S9 lineup, LG G7 ThinQ, and Google Pixel, are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845, the company is introducing a mid-range chip that can support the premium qualities that are no long exclusive to these flagship phones. These choice features are possible thanks to the Qualcomm AI Engine, Qualcomm Spectra ISP, Qualcomm Kryo CPU, and Qualcomm Adreno GPU that make up the system which ""bring new experiences to consumers globally,"" according to company VP of product management, Kedar Kondap. With the development of this chip, you no longer have to be the owner of an iPhone XS for a high-quality mobile gaming experience, ""epic"" selfies, and an advanced AI assistant.  As Qualcomm stated, ""the most advanced games demand a lot out of a smartphone,"" like high frame-rates and specific APIs, for example. The Snapdragon 675 takes all of these into account, while the chip is also optimized for popular games and game engines such as Unity, Unreal, and Messiah. The Snapdragon 675 also bows to the trend of numerous AI-assisted camera lenses on a single device by supporting a triple camera configuration compatible with telephoto, wide angle, and super-wide-angle lenses. Additionally, the chip supports an enhanced portrait mode and limitless slow-motion all in HD with help from the AI to optimally shoot media.  In general, though, the multi-core AI engine supports far more than just the camera of a device. The software is engineered to become the ultimate assistant by, ""learning and adapting to a user's voice, and optimizing battery life."" It can support device security and translation, as well.  The 675 is expected to be implemented into consumer phones in Q1 of 2019, but with the mobile platform already being available today, developers can get started creating apps, services, and other features that optimize this new generation system-on-chip.",TECHNOLOGY
"Unicode Emoji 12.0 Beta Hosts 236 Draft Candidates, While Apple Focuses on Diversity ","It is the Unicode Consortium’s job to maintain and publish the standards on which new emojis are made. Considering how emojis have become a language of communication, particularly on smartphones and instant messenger apps, they gain more importance now than ever before. This time around, the Unicode Consortium has confirmed that there are 236 draft candidates in place for the Emoji 12.0 beta package. At the same time, Apple is working on the new emojis for next year, even as it prepares to ship the Emoji 11 update for this year with the upcoming iOS 12.1 software for iPhones and iPads.   The Unicode Consortium’s Emoji 12.0 Beta focuses on new emojis that illustrate human disabilities, such as a human ear which is wearing a hearing aid, male and female emojis signifying hearing disabilities, communicating with sign language, a male and female with a cane, a male and female in a wheelchair and a guide dog, for instance. At present, Apple, Google, Facebook, Adobe, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, Netflix, Oracle, SAP and Shopify are some of the consortium members.   The 236 draft candidates for Emoji 12.0 include 209 emojis related to people, 7 related to animals and nature, 6 new emojis for travel and 15 emojis for objects, among others. It is expected that Emoji 12.0 will roll out for use by software developers in March. It may be some time before phone makers and app companies including Apple, Google and Samsung actually deploy these new emojis. It is expected that Apple will integrate these in next year’s iOS 13 update, which should be unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) with the final release for all users later in the year.

Is Samsung Planning a Truly Notch-Less And Bezel-Less Future? ,"Samsung has a reputation for mocking smartphone notches (such as that on the Pixel 3), but honestly, who can blame them? Sure, notches have a practical purpose like housing camera lenses, speakers, and a variety of sensors, nevertheless, they have a reputation for being so unaesthetic that some Pixel 3 users have been digging into their phones' user settings to hide the notch completely by implementing a screen-wide black bar.

Apple iPhone XR Review: The Colourful iPhone That Sets up Many Questions ,"Let us start with a thought that you might want to chew on for a bit—how important is the display panel type, when you are considering buying a phone? As in, are your eyes perfectly tuned to figure out the difference between an LCD and an OLED screen, or maybe even the fine differences between different types of OLED screens? If your answer is on the lines of “yes, very important”, then you can safely move on to reading another article on this website. However, if you are leaning towards “not too important as long as it gets the job done”, you might want to stick around for a bit longer.   What we have on the agenda today is the new Apple iPhone XR. This is the return of the colourful iPhones after many years (yes, the iPhone 5c was a long time ago). This was also expected to be the truly affordable iPhone this year, which would in many ways run a calming hand over the fevered brow of those who otherwise find the iPhones too expensive. The complication however is that unlike the iPhone X last year, and the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max this year and so on, you simply knew you were getting an upgrade—across all considerations you may have. With the iPhone XR, it isn’t that simple. This is an iPhone that makes you wait, and look at it, and deliberate—and that is not just because of its beautiful colour options.   The first thing you need to consider is the price. The iPhone XR is priced at Rs76,900 (64GB), Rs81,900 (128GB) and Rs91,900 (256GB). This is what many expected, correctly or wrongly, would be an “affordable” iPhone. The price at which the iPhone XR lands in India does have to factor in the fairly volatile currency at the moment, as well as local taxes and what not, which means it isn’t what many hoped it would be.   The exciting colours that the iPhone XR is available in, make it tough to choose a favorite. There is the sophisticated blue, a subtle white, a comfortable black, a chirpy yellow, a cheerful coral and the gorgeous (PRODUCT)Red to choose from. The colours will make this iPhone stand out in a crowd from other iPhones, and any other phone for that matter. The design language is the same as the iPhone XS, which means it is up to date on the design front.   Apple iPhone XR-2  The iPhone XR doesn’t compromise on the build quality, and instead, the combination of glass and metal that you will hold in your hand clearly has the same Apple-esque precision that we have come to expect. The attention to detail is best explained by the fact that the inside of the Lightning port on the phone also adorns the colour of the iPhone XR. The slight shine that the glass layer adds to the back, makes colours such as Coral sparkle very nicely. Incidentally, the glass used on the iPhone XR certainly doesn’t catch as many fingerprints as last year’s iPhone X. Apple doesn't exactly say who makes the glass, but the changes this time around have worked well. That said, the moment you pick up the iPhone XR, it feels a tad heavier than you expect. Some of it has to do with the display technology, some of it has to do with the materials being used—but the extra weight is noticeable initially. To put numbers in perspective, it is 17 grams heavier than the iPhone XS and 16 grams lighter than the larger iPhone XS Max.  Apple has downgraded the water and dust resistance rating on the iPhone XR. It is IP 67, as compared to IP 68 on the iPhone XS and XS Max to IP 67. This means that the iPhone XR will be able to take a dip in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes and come away unscathed, as against 2 meters of water for 30 minutes which the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max can survive.  It is hard to miss the thicker black bezel running around the display notice that the bezel around the screen is ever so slightly thicker than the iPhone XS devices, but a lot of that also has to do with the LCD display backlighting as compared with the OLED screens. Apple calls the iPhone XR’s LCD display as Liquid Retina. It would perhaps be unfair to compare this with an OLED screen on the iPhone XS. Yes, while this has a lower pixel density and resolution than the OLED iPhones, it is still touching 326 pixels per inch. This is the same as all iPhones apart from the iPhone X, the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max. Anyone upgrading from any other iPhone apart from these three, should not notice any difference at all as they use the iPhone XR for the regular daily usage. As far as the brightness, colour vibrancy and sharpness are concerned, this Liquid Retina display does the job. It is rich to look at, text looks great, photo editing is immersive and there are very minimal reflections only. However, look at the display at an angle, and the colour shift is quite perceptible, something that wasn't the case with earlier LCD displays on previous generation iPhones.   Incidentally, this Liquid Retina display does not support 3D Touch—could this be the first indication of the beginning of the end for this feature? Hard to say, but the iPhone XR could be indicating the future.   It is quite positive that the iPhone XR isn’t compromising at all in terms of the power. It shares the same innards as the more expensive iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. The powerful Apple A12 Bionic, which is the first 7-nanometer chip in a smartphone, is the heart and soul of the iPhone XR too. That means it'll have the same level of computing prowess when it comes to the artificial intelligence algorithms—including for Portrait photos, AR apps and Animojis. The iPhone XR also has the same TrueDepth Module too.  Apple iPhone XR-4  The sameness ends when we flip the iPhone XR around—the rear camera. The single 12-megapixel camera with the f/1.8 aperture and Smart HDR. It has the same image processing algorithms as the iPhone XS, which means most photos should retain the same brilliance and level of detailing. However, the big change is this is one single optical hardware, instead of the dual cameras that the other two iPhones have. Smart HDR is a great tool to have, and the way Apple have optimized it, we notice that it retains much more detail in the shadows for instance, while the rest of the frame doesn’t get blown out. There is no secondary telephoto lens, and you’ll probably miss it of you are used to taking a lot of photos on zoom—for someone who has been spoilt with the 2x optical zoom on the iPhone X and beyond, this takes some getting used to.   The bigger limitations are experienced with the portrait mode. While the iPhone XS and XS Max combine the data captured by the wide-angle lens and the telephoto lens, the iPhone XR’s rear-camera Portrait Mode relies heavily on software. As things are, this only works if it can detect a human face in the frame. No, it won’t get conned by pets or soft toys or statues or bobbleheads (at least in our experience). If you want to take a portrait photo of an object or a thing, that won’t happen. The camera app will tell you “No person detected”. While the iPhones with dual cameras have five Portrait photography and editing modes, the iPhone XR has only three. Which means, from Natural Light, Studio Light, Contour Light, Stage Light, and Stage Light Mono, the iPhone XR eliminates Stage Light and Stage Light Mono, since there is no secondary optical hardware to provide additional photography data for these to work. However, you do get complete depth control which can be edited using the slider—the same as the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. There are times when the software struggles a bit to do consistent mapping of the subject and edge detection struggles a bit.   Whether you buy the iPhone XR or not does not depend on the display or whether this offers a performance compromise. Instead, it will totally hinge on whether you need the secondary rear camera for portrait and zoom photos. If you are okay with the limited Portrait mode, and really like the Yellow, Blue, (PRODUCT)Red or Coral colours, the iPhone XR is absolutely worth the experience. But there is still the iPhone X to consider. And whether you really see value in an iPhone XR over even last year’s iPhone X (dual camera and very powerful A11 Bionic chip). To say that the iPhone X is still an excellent iPhone is surely a massive understatement.  ",TECHNOLOGY

Facebook Rolling Out Biggest Messenger Design Update For Its 1.3 Billion Users ,"The social network began rolling out a redesigned version featuring three tabs instead of nine, saying it was ""going back to its roots"" seven years after the standalone app's launch. ""We build one feature after another; they're piling up,"" Messenger chief Stan Chudnovsky said of the service, which has grown from a simple messaging app to one that lets users make video calls, send money and more.  The updated tabs allow users to navigate between their conversations under ""Chats,"" stories and contacts at ""People,"" and ""Discovery,"" which is devoted to games and exchanges with businesses. Facebook has positioned Messenger as a tool for businesses to efficiently handle customer questions or concerns. Talking to customers via the app is free -- but businesses can also pay for Facebook ads that let customers start a conversation or visit their page with one click.  Messenger is part of Facebook's effort to expand outside the social network -- particularly when it comes to staying relevant to mobile lifestyles and younger people, who have been moving away from the service.

"Amazon.com, Qualcomm to Put Alexa Assistant in More Headphones ","Microchip firm Qualcomm Inc is joining Amazon.com Inc to spread the use of Amazon's Alexa voice assistant in wireless headphones, the companies said on Monday. Under the deal, Qualcomm will release a set of chips that any maker of Bluetooth headphones can use to embed Alexa directly into the device. When the headphones are paired to a phone with the Alexa app on it, users will be able to talk to the voice assistant by tapping a button on the headphones.  The functionality would be similar to Apple Inc's AirPods wireless earbuds, which enable users can tap the devices to talk to Apple's virtual assistant, Siri. Amazon and Alphabet Inc's Google, whose voice assistants have most often been found in their respective smart speakers for the home, are rushing to partner with headphone makers.  Models from Bose Corp and Jabra feature Alexa built in, and Sony Corp said earlier this year that a software update will make some of its headphone models work with Alexa. Google Assistant can be used on headphones from Bose, JBL and Sony, along with Google's own Pixel Buds. The Qualcomm partnership could expand that lineup. Qualcomm has developed a pre-made circuit that headphone makers can drop into their device to imbue it with Alexa.  ""This radically reduces their [engineering] cost and time to market,"" Anthony Murray, senior vice president and general manager of voice and music for Qualcomm, told Reuters in an interview. ""It makes it simple for the industry to adopt this."" Murray declined to comment on whether Qualcomm would make a similar offering for Google Assistant but said the chip firm plans to support other partners in the future.  The move is part of a broader push by Qualcomm to diversify away from its dependence on processor and modem chips for mobile phones. That business proved lucrative for Qualcomm, but its patent licensing model drew regulatory fines and lawsuits from customers such as Apple Inc. At a conference in Hong Kong slated for early Tuesday local time, Qualcomm also said it is working with action camera maker GoPro Inc to put more Qualcomm chips for image processing in the devices. The firm has said it expects about $5 billion in revenue from non-mobile sources this year, or more than 20 percent of the $22.4 billion in sales that analysts expect. ",TECHNOLOGY

Appliance Manufacturer Dyson to Make Electric Cars in Singapore ,"British electric appliance pioneer Dyson said it had picked Singapore as the site for its first electric car plant as part of a £2.5 billion (2.8 billion euro, $3.3 billion) global investment drive in new technology. Dyson, founded and owned by Brexit-backing billionaire entrepreneur James Dyson, said the factory was scheduled for completion in 2020. The company, best known for its cordless vacuum cleaners, hand dryers and fans, is aiming to launch electric vehicles in 2021.  ""The decision of where to make our car is complex, based on supply chains, access to markets and the availability of the expertise that will help us achieve our ambitions,"" Dyson chief executive Jim Rowan said in a statement.  ""Our existing footprint and team in Singapore, combined with the nation's significant advanced manufacturing expertise, made it a frontrunner. Singapore also offers access to high-growth markets as well as an extensive supply chain and a highly-skilled workforce,"" he said.  ""Singapore has a comparatively high-cost base, but also great technology expertise and focus. It is therefore the right place to make high-quality technology loaded machines, and the right place to make our electric vehicle.""  Dyson announced his decision to launch electric cars last year -- a sector in which the company will face stiff competition from established players. Electric vehicles are increasing in popularity as governments worldwide drive forward plans to gradually phase out polluting petrol and diesel cars.  Dyson told AFP in an interview earlier this year that electric cars were already available to order and the manufacturing location would be either in Britain or Asia. The company said that 2017 operating profit surged by almost one third to around £800 million, aided by fast growth in China, India, Japan, Korea and Taiwan.

Pixelgate? Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL Reliability Issues Just Don’t Seem to Stop ,"The Google Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL cannot seem to catch a break. As it turns out, Google’s latest smartphones have some serious reliability issues.   One of the problems being reported is the familiar speaker buzzing. A lot of early adopters are taking to social media platforms including Twitter to suggest that the bottom speaker on the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL phones is producing a random buzzing noise, mostly being reported by users to be audible at mid-range frequencies being played back at low volumes. It is not immediately clear whether the louder audio drowns out the sound or eliminates it altogether, as you push up the volume. “The speaker lightly buzzes from 500-2500Hz, and buzzes very loudly at 20-500Hz. Higher volumes can drown out the buzz but it's still audible, whereas lower volumes can make things almost unlistenable. Just typing on Gboard and tapping through the UI creates a very noticeable buzz,” reports a user qtpa2tnh on Reddit, and he owns a Pixel 3 XL.   This is the second issue to befall the speakers on Google’s newest phones. Earlier, it was reported that the two speakers on the new Pixel phones don’t have the same audio output levels. Though Google did take to Reddit to clarify that this is by design, it hasn’t assuaged the fears. “Hi all, This is by design. We specially designed speakers that allow for louder sound (40% louder than last year) and better low frequency response. We use new amplifier technology with advanced speaker protection algorithms to push these speakers harder and really get every last bit of performance out of them. We also worked closely with the expert tuning of a Grammy-award winning music producer to enhance the audio in a way that plays to the strengths of the hardware system.” However, users are not convinced. “I initially thought the top speaker was busted...but no it's just noticeably quieter than the bottom one,” said a user with the handle rayw_reddit. “Pixel 3 XL owner here. I can confirm the imbalance is real. The bottom speaker is much louder and better with bass, and the top is definitely softer and slightly better with treble. It doesn't bother me much if I tell myself Google did that intentionally, but why call them ""stereo?” asks another user mcnick0495.   And it isn’t just the buzzing speakers which are the problem for the new Pixel phones.   A lot of users are reporting an issue with memory management on the new Pixel phones. Apparently, the background process for certain apps that are being used at the time get stopped if the user switches to another app temporarily—this could be quite nasty with music or video streaming apps, for instance. This could be an issue with very aggressive process killing, or the fact that the phone isn’t holding more than a couple of apps temporarily in the RAM at any given point of time. That said, Google’s decision to have 4GB of RAM in the new Pixel phones is surely not the reason for this, but something more on the lines of poorly optimized task management.   The final trouble that users are reporting with the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL phones is that sometimes they do not save photos that you may have clicked using the default camera app. This is despite the fact that a little preview appears at the bottom of the screen once you tap the shutter button suggesting the photo has been saved, when it actually doesn’t show up in the list of photos later. It is not immediately known if this is a camera bug or an issue with how the Photos app integrates with the camera on the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL.   This is a bit unfortunate, considering how the Pixel 2 XL phones from last year also struggled with certain issues, such as speaker buzzing and a very muted display. The magnitude of any potential hardware or software problems just gets expanded, since the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL are largely running the same hardware, except the differing display sizes for instance, which wasn’t exactly the case in the past year.

Teens And Europe Are Giving up on Facebook; But Instagram is The Surprise Gainer ,"The tough year for Facebook shows no signs of abating. There really is no getting around the fact that people are leaving Facebook, perhaps as a fallout of all the scandals which have dented consumer confidence significantly. Teens are giving up on Facebook, those above the age of 50 simply don’t understand how it works and Europe is set to give Facebook even more headaches.   According to estimates by financial services firm Morgan Stanley, Facebook’s user base in Europe may have stumbled by as much as 1 million, owing to the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which kicked in over the summer. This would be a direct result of Facebook requiring hundreds of millions of European users to either opt in to having data collected, as per the new GDPR rules, or stop using the site.   However, in the midst of Facebook’s turmoil, its sister app Instagram is the big gainer. The latest numbers shared by investment banking and asset management firm Piper Jaffray suggest that Facebook’s sister social network, Instagram, has seen a spike in popularity. And it is also hurting its biggest rival, Snapchat, along the way.   The Piper Jaffray Taking Stock With Teens Survey numbers suggest that 85 percent of teens use Instagram at least once per month, compared with 84 percent for Snapchat. The Instagram numbers are up from 81 percent same time last year, though Snapchat has also seen an increase from 82 percent in the same period of 2017.   Last month, numbers released by Pew Research suggested that a whopping 44 percent of those ages 18 to 29 in the US suggest that they have deleted the Facebook app from their phone in the past one year—Pew has surveyed 3,400 Facebook users in May and June this year. Surely, the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which became public knowledge earlier this year, would have been fresh in the minds of Facebook users.   However, it is a bit more complicated than that. The research also suggested that 26 percent of the survey respondents confirmed to having deleted the Facebook app, 42 percent said that they were temporarily “taking a break” from the social media platform and 54 percent have adjusted their privacy settings.  There is another big challenge for Facebook—a lot of its users simply don’t understand how the News Feed works. Pew Research, 53 percent of US adults who use Facebook do not understand how the News Feed works, how the content that they see is chosen to be there and why some content is given priority over other posts.

Google to Charge Android Partners up to $40 Per Device For Apps ,"Alphabet Inc's Google will charge hardware firms up to $40 per device to use its apps under a new licensing system to replace one that the European Union this year deemed anti-competitive, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. The new fee goes into effect on Oct. 29 for any new smartphone or tablet models launched in the European Economic Area and running Google's Android operating system, the company announced on Tuesday.  The fee can be as low as $2.50 and rises depending on the country and device size, the person said. It is standard across manufacturers, with the majority likely to pay around $20, the person added. Companies can offset the charge, which applies to a suite of apps including the Google Play app store, Gmail and Google Maps, by placing Google's search and Chrome internet browser in a prominent position. Under that arrangement, Google would give the device maker a portion of ad revenue it generates through search and Chrome.  Tech news outlet the Verge reported the pricing earlier on Friday, citing confidential documents. The European Commission in July found Google abused its market dominance in mobile software to essentially force Android partners to pre-install search and Chrome on their gadgets. It levied a record $5-billion fine, which Google has appealed, and threatened additional penalties unless the company ended its illegal practices.  The new system should give Google's rivals such as Microsoft Corp more room to partner with hardware makers to become the default apps for search and browsing, analysts said. Qwant, a small French search company that has been critical of Google, said in a statement on Friday that it was ""satisfied that the European Commission's action pushed Google to finally give manufacturers the possibility to offer such choices to consumers.""",TECHNOLOGY
"NASA Names New Gamma-Ray Constellations After Godzilla, Hulk ","NASA has used certain characters from modern myths such as the ""Hulk"" and ""Godzilla"" to name its new set of 21 gamma-ray constellations constructed in celebration of its Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope's 10th year of operations. Fermi has mapped about 3,000 gamma-ray sources -- 10 times the number known before its launch and comparable to the number of bright stars in the traditional constellations.  ""For the first time ever, the number of known gamma-ray sources was comparable to the number of bright stars, so we thought a new set of constellations was a great way to illustrate the point,"" NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center's Elizabeth Ferrara who led the constellation project said in a statement. ""Developing these unofficial constellations was a fun way to highlight a decade of Fermi's accomplishments,"" Julie McEnery, the Fermi project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said.   Comic book fans who know the backstory of Hulk, the big, green, angry alter ego of Bruce Banner, whose experiments with gamma rays went terribly wrong, could easily appreciate NASA's pick in naming one of its constellations. Gamma rays are the strongest form of light. They pack enough punch to convert into matter under the right circumstances, a transformation both Banner and the Hulk would certainly appreciate.  NASA's choice of Godzilla constellation is linked to its trademark weapon ""heat ray,"" a fiery jet. This bears at least a passing resemblance to gamma-ray jets associated with black holes and neutron stars. Godzilla ranks as one of cinema's most famous monsters and is among the most recognisable symbols of Japanese popular culture.   In the original 1954 movie, nuclear weapons tests disturb the creature's deep ocean habitat, and it emerges from the sea to wreak havoc in Japan. The 21 gamma-ray constellations also include famous landmarks -- such as Sweden's recovered warship, Vasa, the Washington Monument and Mount Fuji in Japan -- in countries contributing to Fermi science.   Since 2008, Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT) has been scanning the entire sky each day, mapping and measuring sources of gamma rays, the highest-energy light in the universe. The emission may come from pulsars, nova outbursts, the debris of supernova explosions and giant gamma-ray bubbles located in our own galaxy, or supermassive black holes and gamma-ray bursts -- the most powerful explosions in the cosmos -- in others.   ""Fermi is still going strong, and we are now preparing a new all-sky LAT catalog,"" said Jean Ballet, a Fermi team member at the French Atomic Energy Commission in Saclay. ""This will add about 2,000 sources, many varying greatly in brightness, further enriching these constellations and enlivening the high-energy sky!""",TECHNOLOGY

WhatsApp Flooded With Fake News Ahead of Brazil Election ,"Facebook Inc's popular messaging service WhatsApp has become a political battleground in Brazil's most polarized election in decades, raising concerns that it is distorting debate beyond the public eye. Facebook has touted efforts to crack down on misinformation on its main platform ahead of the Oct. 28 presidential run-off between right-winger Jair Bolsonaro and leftist Fernando Haddad. But WhatsApp has been flooded with falsehoods and conspiracy theories. Haddad now alleges that businessmen supporting Bolsonaro have been paying to bombard voters with misleading propaganda in violation of electoral law, which his rival denies.  HOW INFLUENTIAL IS WHATSAPP?  WhatsApp has more than 120 million users in Brazil, a country of nearly 210 million, rivaling the reach of Facebook's main platform in one of the company's biggest global markets. The messaging service has become one of the main ways Brazilians keep in touch with friends, colleagues and family. The election's first-round vote on Oct. 7 underscored the major role that social media now plays in Brazilian politics.  Bolsonaro, a seven-term congressman from a tiny party, had little access to public campaign funding or TV advertising but his grassroots campaign and outsized presence on social media helped him win 46 percent of votes, nearly foregoing a run-off. Polling firm Datafolha found that two-thirds of Brazilian voters use WhatsApp. Bolsonaro supporters were more likely to follow political news on the platform with 61 percent saying they did so, compared to 38 percent of Haddad voters.  WHAT ARE THE RISKS?  WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption allows groups of hundreds of users to exchange texts, photos and video beyond the purview of electoral authorities, independent fact checkers or even the platform itself. False rumors, manipulated photos, decontextualized videos and audio hoaxes have become campaign ammunition, going viral on the platform with no way to monitor their origin or full reach.  Many of the fakes portray Haddad as a communist whose Workers Party would turn Brazil into another Cuba, convert children to homosexuality and plans to rig voting machines. Others have spread a conspiracy theory that Bolsonaro had staged his near-fatal stabbing at a rally last month, which took him off the campaign trail and out of presidential debates. WhatsApp has tried to discourage the tsunami of falsehoods by limiting how many recipients a message can be forwarded to. The company also has run public advertising on how to spot fake news and blocked hundreds of thousands of accounts during the campaign, with technology spotting automated ""bot"" behavior.  WHAT IS THE LATEST SCANDAL?  Haddad accuses Bolsonaro of not just benefiting from misinformation on WhatsApp but encouraging supporters to fund bulk messaging over the platform. That would amount to soliciting illegal campaign contributions in what they call an ""abuse of economic power"" undermining the election. On Thursday, newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported Bolsonaro supporters had paid digital marketing firms up to 12 million reais ($3.26 million) each to spread tens of thousands of attack ads. Haddad said his party had witnesses who heard Bolsonaro encouraging business leaders to fund the efforts.  Bolsonaro has denied any knowledge of such a scheme and called on any supporters doing so to stop. WhatsApp said it takes the allegations seriously and is ""taking immediate legal action to stop companies from sending bulk messages,"" including cease-and-desist letters to the companies in question.  WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES?  Brazil's chief electoral court on Friday opened an investigation into the allegations, which pundits quickly labeled ""WhatsAppgate."" Haddad's allies argue that the scandal should invalidate the election. However, the investigation is unlikely to derail Bolsonaro's campaign with just a week to go before the vote and an 18 percentage point lead over Haddad in recent opinion polls.  Still, the allegations have tensed up an already angry and polarized electorate and are likely to hang over the next government. The way marketing companies obtained cellphone numbers used for WhatsApp messaging may have violated Brazil's data privacy laws, according to Fabio Malini, a professor of technology at Espirito Santo federal university.  Brazilian lawmakers and judges have tried repeatedly in recent years to encroach on the privacy offered by WhatsApp, creating headaches for Facebook executives who are often called to account. The latest electoral scandal could intensify those pressures.",TECHNOLOGY

Apple CEO Tim Cook Urges Bloomberg to Retract Spy Chip Story ,"Apple CEO Tim Cook is urging Bloomberg to retract its story about an alleged embedded Chinese spying chips that compromised about 30 companies including the servers of Apple. BuzzFeed News said Friday that the Apple CEO, who received an interview with the news outlet on Thursday, went on the record for the first time to deny allegations that his company was the victim of a hardware-based attack from a Chinese supplier and demanded Bloomberg retract the unfounded story, reports Xinhua news agency.  ""There is no truth in their story about Apple,"" Cook told BuzzFeed News. ""They need to do that right thing and retract it."" Bloomberg Businessweek issued a story earlier this month alleging about 30 US companies were compromised after their servers were implanted malicious chips during their manufacture in China, which created ""a stealth backdoor"" into their network running on the servers. Apple denied in an October 4 statement that it had found the ""malicious chips"" in servers on its network, saying it refuted ""virtually every aspect of Bloomberg' s story relating to Apple"".  ""Apple has never found malicious chips, hardware manipulations or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server,"" it said. In the latest response to the Bloomberg claims, Cook said he ""was involved in our response to this story from the beginning"". ""I personally talked to the Bloomberg reporters along with Bruce Sewell, who was then our general counsel. We were very clear with them that this did not happen, and answered all their questions,"" said Cook.   ""Each time they brought this up to us, the story changed, and each time we investigated we found nothing,"" he added. ""We turned the company upside down... We really forensically whipped through the company to dig very deep and each time we came back to the same conclusion: this did not happen. There's no truth to this,"" Cook said. The Bloomberg's report has been extensively questioned even by representatives of the companies it claimed to fall victim to the ""backdoor"" attack.  Earlier this month, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee to ""be careful what you read"" in reference to the report, BuzzFeed News said. It quoted a high-ranking executive of a tech giant in Silicon Valley as saying that his company has conducted investigations, which didn' t turn up any evidence of tampering. ""We couldn't find anything,"" he said. ""Our assessment is that it didn't happen.""",TECHNOLOGY
Uber Integrates Data Calling Into App ,"For many countries across the world, it's cheaper to make calls over the internet than cellularly; if you're an international traveler, data calling is often the only option. It's no wonder a global transportation service like Uber would want to join the VoIP (or voice of internet protocol) movement. In fact, the ride-hailing service has been working on the feature since June, but just this week it became available, according to The Verge.  Uber has long provided users with an internet-based in-app chat function, as well as the options to send SMS text messages and make phone calls through a telephone network. Unfortunately, users were finding themselves in situations where the in-app chat wasn't enough to adequately connect them to a driver when a cellular network wasn't available. Now, whether a message needs to be sent or a call made, the entire service can take place online via the app.  Streamlined communication is essential for transportation services, and the VoIP option is a trending feature that both connects people and saves them money. As Gagan Mac, project manager for communications at Uber noted, ""smooth pickups hinge on seamless communication between riders and drivers,"" and such an addition puts the company just a step ahead of other popular ride-hailing services like Lyft or Easy Taxi.",TECHNOLOGY

Juventus too Good for Manchester United on Ronaldo's Return ,"Cristiano Ronaldo emerged victorious again on his second return to Old Trafford, but this time did not get on the scoresheet as Juventus outclassed Manchester United to win 1-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday.  Instead, Ronaldo played a supporting role by helping set up Paulo Dybala's winner on 17 minutes as the Italian champions opened up a five-point lead over United at the top of Group H.  Jose Mourinho's men were handed a break before kick-off as Valencia's 1-1 draw away to Young Boys means United still hold a two-point lead over the Spaniards, but a fourth defeat of the season will see speculation over Mourinho's future increase once more.  But for a series of excellent saves from David de Gea, the margin of defeat could have been far greater too as any momentum United gained from fightbacks against Newcastle and Chelsea in recent weeks in the Premier League faded away against one of the favourites to win the Champions League.  Ronaldo was given a hero's welcome on his previous visit to Old Trafford with Real Madrid in 2013 after scoring 118 goals for United in six seasons between 2003 and 2009 to help the Red Devils win three Premier League titles and the first of his five Champions Leagues.  The Portuguese's early days as Juventus player since making the move to Italy from Madrid this summer have been overshadowed by a rape allegation made against him in the United States.  The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has strongly denied the allegation and been backed by his new club, who paid 112 million euros ($129 million) for the 33-year-old in July.  But the reception he received from the United faithful this time was far more muted with only a mild cheer raised when his name in the Juventus line-up was announced.  Ronaldo scored the winner in a contentious Champions League last-16 tie for Madrid five years ago, but this time played the role of provider for Dybala to be the match-winner.  His cross intended for Juan Cuadrado ricocheted kindly off Chris Smalling into the path of Dybala to sweep the ball past De Gea for his fourth goal in two Champions League games.  As Juventus dominated the rest of the first half, only De Gea stood in their way of killing the game off before the break.  The Spaniard flew to his right to save Joao Cancelo's fiercely-struck shot then produced a fine double save to parry Ronaldo's free-kick and swat away Blaise Matuidi's follow-up effort.  Top scorer in this competition for the past six seasons, Ronaldo is still searching for his first Champions League goal for Juventus having been sent off after just 30 minutes of his European debut against Valencia and subsequently banned for a 3-0 victory over Young Boys.  He couldn't have done much more with an effort that soared towards De Gea's top corner seven minutes into the second half only to see the United 'keeper produce a miraculous right-handed save.  Going behind brought out the best in Mourinho's side against Newcastle and Chelsea to help ease the pressure on the manager.  But the hosts failed to threaten until Paul Pogba's curling shot from outside the box hit the post 15 minutes from time.  Anthony Martial also tested Wojciech Szczesny late on but Juventus held out for a deserved victory.",SPORTS
"AIFF Intent on Restructuring Indian Football, But Road Ahead Remains Unclear ","Ahead of the 2017/18 edition of the I-League, the biggest talking point among fans and experts alike was the fact that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) had decided to keep the Indian football team that featured in the FIFA U-17 World Cup together as the ‘Indian Arrows’ in a bid to further develop the burgeoning talents.   Yet perhaps the biggest elephant in the room – the fact that the I-League and the Indian Super League (ISL) would be running simultaneously for the first time ahead of a major restructure of the domestic football system – was not addressed at the time.   One year later and with the potential threat of an Asian ban looming should they fail to unify the two leagues by the 2019/20 season, the AIFF unsurprisingly chose to address the issue head on.   “Let us look at the bigger picture. We are talking about restructuring the league and we have a holistic plan for that where we are going to take all the leagues into account and make a better league structure so that India can perform better internationally,” AIFF senior vice-president Subrata Dutta said at the I-League launch in New Delhi on Tuesday.   Yet while it was refreshing to hear that the AIFF were finally looking to merge the two domestic leagues, there are a number of issues that must be addressed before the huge decision is finally taken.   Earlier this year, news broke of a FIFA-backed report that suggested an Asian ban for Indian clubs should they fail to come up with a unified league by the next season.   The report was refuted by AIFF general secretary Kushal Das, who stated that he was yet to receive any report from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and that a decision will be taken in due course.   Complicated Roadmap   However, coming up with a new system will be complicated to say the least considering the fact that an arrangement currently exists that sees the ISL clubs get a 10-year immunity from relegation from 2014 onwards.   Even though the FIFA report called for a review of that and some other arrangements, there is every possibility that it could be upheld even after it is evaluated by the necessary authorities.   This would mean that ISL clubs will not be relegated from 2019-23 while I-League clubs will be both promoted and relegated as the report stated that the new league must become a 16-team tournament by 2023.   More tellingly, this arrangement will see the majority of the I-League clubs – which include legacy sides like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan among others – excluded from the new merged league, at least in the initial stages.   For his part, Dutta stated that it would be unwise to view the leagues individually as the plan was to eventually freshen up the whole domestic league system in India.   “We should not analyse just one league. We should include ISL, we should include I-League and we should include age-group leagues as well as think about the second division league since they all add value to football in our country,” Dutta said.   Yet to not view the ISL and I-League as separate entities given the differing natures of both tournaments is something of an exercise in futility.   One league has been in existence for only five years and has massive financial backing whereas the other began in 1996 as the National Football League and features some of India’s most successful clubs yet has never had the kind of exposure the new league did.   There’s also the fact that I-League clubs tend to enjoy better in-stadium attendance, something the ISL has struggled with especially after the league began to run for longer than two months.   Including the ISL clubs in the revamped league structure makes sense given the amount of money that has been invested in them, yet a truly holistic approach will be needed if the benefits of the reforms are to be enjoyed by all Indian clubs.

I-League: Debutants Real Kashmir Hoping Home Comforts Help in Making it Another Year to Remember ,"New Delhi: For a state like Jammu and Kashmir that has been battling to survive the onslaught that results from a fractious relationship between India and Pakistan, the emergence of Real Kashmir FC in Srinagar has not only brought top flight football to the state for the first time but also is a breath of fresh air.   The club began their journey in 2016 after co-owners Shamim Meraj and Sandeep Chattoo felt it was essential to provide the youth of the state a positive outlet.  “It is a great feeling for us that we are the first team from our state to play in the I-League. Many young boys and girls are playing football nowadays and we feel happy seeing that,” Danish Farooq, the 22-year-old who’s penalty helped the team achieve qualification, said.  Having qualified for the top flight at the expense of Hindustan FC from Delhi in May, the David Robertson-managed side is looking to make a mark in the country’s premier competition, the I-League. The debutants will open their campaign against the defending champions Minerva Punjab (October 31st) in Panchkula, before heading back for a string of home games. Their first home game will be against Goan side Churchill Brothers on November 6th.  Coach Robertson, who has roped in his son Mason into the squad as one of the six foreigners, understands the upcoming season will not be an easy one for his side. The Scot not only has kept his eyes and ears open as he tried to blend talent, experience and youth into his side, but also emphasised that the players coming in needed to be able to keep up the team spirit and camaraderie.  “We begin our journey against the champions (Minerva Punjab) away from home before coming back for six games. That’s where we need to capitalise and get our points, because otherwise suddenly you’ll be in a position of no return and getting demoted will be terrible for the team and the people,” Robertson explains on the sidelines of a promotional event with sportswear giants Adidas. The German company are the kit sponsors for Real Kashmir FC.  “It will definitely be difficult to be one of the title contenders for the season, but I believe with a bit of luck we can finish hopefully in the top half.”  Local Support Can be Our 12th Man  Initially, there was a possibility that Real Kashmir would not be able to play their home games at their favoured Tourist Reception Centre (TRC) ground, but after multiple inspections following the upgradation of facilities, the stadium will play host to its first I-League game on November 6th.  The team’s coach and players were relieved that they will play their home game in Srinagar and an elated club co-owner Shamim Meraj said, “We have things in place (to host I-League games). The capacity of the ground is 10,000 but we will have to cap it to around 6,000 to ensure everything goes smoothly.”  On the big opening day, security arrangements are expected to be boosted as both club and authorities want things to go through without a hiccup.  “I am expecting to see a very noisey bunch at the ground. I’ve seen how a crowd can motivate players and teams and I hope the local crowd in Srinagar can do the same, be our 12th man,” Robertson, the former Aberdeen and Rangers FC player, said.  However, more than a vibrant crowd what is more likely to fit the home advantage bill for Real Kashmir will be the difficult conditions traveling teams will face in Srinagar.  Club captain Loveday Enyinnaya, a Nigerian professional who has turned out for a whole host of Indian clubs like Malabar United F.C., Royal Wahingdoh F.C., Sporting clube de Goa and Minerva Punjab F.C., believes his side is not under any pressure and that it will be up to the others to play well against them in difficult conditions.  “It will be difficult for teams coming to play against us because of the weather. When I had come here initially, I faced problems with the cold to start with, but now I have adjusted. The others won’t find it easy,” says Loveday with a mischievous grin.",SPORTS

From One Teen Sensation to Another - Shooting Coach Rana Has Success Mantra for Manu Bhaker and Saurabh Chaudhary ,"Back in the early 1990s when India was still struggling to make a mark in the world of sport, a teenage boy from Uttarakhand had become an overnight shooting star. Jaspal Rana won gold in 25m center fire pistol event in the 1994 Asian Games at Hiroshima and gave the medal-starved country something to cheer about.  In him, India could have had a champion, but that never happened for many reasons. But now, a good 20 years later a lot has changed. We have a bunch of youngsters who are not only making a mark in the junior level but winning competitions with record scores in the senior category too. Manu Bhaker, Saurabh Chaudhary, Mehuli Ghosh, Anish Bhanwala are all household names and the man behind their meteoric rise has been none other than the current junior coach – Rana.  Recently after the Asian Games' success, these youngsters bagged a rich haul of medals at the Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires too. Coach Rana, though happy, doesn’t want to get carried away. For him, these kids already belong in the senior category and need to keep winning against the world’s best.  “To win four medals at Youth Olympics, who wouldn't be happy with that. It's unprecedented effort by our shooters. We do not go by the policy that you got to improve in every competition. We have one clear aim in our mind and that is to get results in every tournament. If we don't prepare like that the results would not come,” Rana told News18 Sports after the team returned from Youth Olympics.  “All these shooters are better than the juniors, but they need to keep putting in the hard work for further success. That feeling to constantly win needs to come from within and that’s what will make them successful against world’s best.”  But having seen the downfall of so many budding shooters, Rana wants to be cautious with the new bunch. He has always been vocal about the need to protect and preserve talents like Bhaker and Choudhary and once again stressed the need to keep them away from distractions.  “I have seen some really talented shooters wasted to distractions like money and fame. It's not a very healthy sign. After every victory when everyone's happy for these kids, whereas I get worried for their future. When you see a player go down, it's not a great feeling personally. And in fact this is with the 90-95% of the shooters. Only 3-4 out of a big bunch have it in them to withstand all this.”  “If you see, these kids are getting lakhs and crores from the state governments. But this money can only get you luxury and not medals.”  One would feel that all junior shooters are in safe hands now as Rana must have been at the start of his career. When we posed this question to Rana, prompt came the reply, “It is not about how well-equipped I am to handle these kids but about how well they understand the situation right now. Also there needs to be some control over the money these shooters are given.”  It’s a precarious position to be in. As much as Rana wants youngsters to realise the worth of staying away from the distractions, he understands that he’s dealing with teenagers, or grown up kids. So it’s not advisable to push them beyond their limits.   “If you see, the performance has improved as compared to the previous years. These young kids carry the burden of expectations from everyone, and their own self too. So they need to be mentally very stable. But it is not possible all the time. Just for instance I was at the shooting range today, and I did not see Manu and Saurabh there. They must have been tired from the flight and felicitation programs. Now Asian leg is on our head and you ought to be training every day. To get results, you have to forget all these factors and be back on your feet.”   A thorough taskmaster that Rana sounds, he finally appreciates his wards and has his hopes pinned on the Asian Championships next year, that will have maximum number of quotas for Tokyo 2020.  “Shooting is perhaps one sport, even if you get results with one method on one occasion, you might fail the next time. So you have to be on top of your game all the time. But then at the end of the day you can just look back at the effort put in and be happy with the work done by the shooters.”  “We hope to get as much quota places as we can for the Olympics in Asian Championships. That is the big goal right now, and I have faith in these shooters to do well,” he signed off.",SPORTS
Lopetegui Confident of Being in Charge Against Barcelona ,"Julen Lopetegui has said he is ""absolutely convinced"" he will still be Real Madrid's coach for the Clasico against Barcelona in La Liga on Sunday.  Madrid hung on for a 2-1 win over Viktoria Plzen on Tuesday as goals from Karim Benzema and Marcelo secured a much-needed, albeit unconvincing, victory.  Lopetegui said he hoped the result would prove a ""turning point"" for his team, who had lost three games on the bounce.  The result puts the European champions level on points with Roma in Group G of the Champions League and offers Lopetegui some respite ahead of this weekend's trip to the Camp Nou.  Asked if he will be in the dug-out against Barca, Lopetegui said after the match: ""I am absolutely convinced of that yes. We won and we are already thinking from tomorrow about preparing for Sunday.""  Real Madrid director Emilio Butragueno also appeared to confirm on Tuesday night that Lopetegui would be in charge against Barcelona.  ""Yes, yes, as normal, absolutely,"" Butragueno said. ""I really believe in this type of game, it is very important to stay calm, be together, trust the players.  ""We live it as normal, it's football and it's true, we hear rumours, but we go with confidence to Camp Nou.""  Madrid's players, including Sergio Ramos, Marcelo and Isco, have been pledging their support to Lopetegui since the loss at home to Levante on Saturday.  Benzema was Madrid's star performer against Plzen and offered his backing afterwards. ""The boss is very good, the players are with him,"" Benzema said.  ""It is important the coach feels the confidence of his players and I have a lot of confidence in him.""  Madrid have struggled for goals in recent weeks but they were a threat going forward against Plzen, who looked on course for a straightforward defeat when Marcelo made it 2-0 early in the second half.  Patrik Hrosovsky, however, pulled a goal back with 12 minutes left and Madrid were left hanging on at the end. The final whistle was accompanied by disgruntled whistles from the home fans.  ""I have not noticed anything special, the fans are sensible and treat us fantastically well,"" Lopetegui said.  ""I would have liked to achieve a more comfortable victory but the most important thing is the three points.""  Marcelo's involvement against Barcelona could be in doubt after he sustained an impact injury late on.  ""He has taken a very heavy blow but it seems that it is a knock and not a muscular issue,"" Lopetegui said. ""I hope he will recover but we have to wait.""",SPORTS
"Rampant Arsenal Face Lisbon Test, Chelsea Sweat on Hazard ","Amid a packed schedule, Arsenal take a 10-match winning streak to Sporting Lisbon as their quest to win the Europa League continues Thursday, when city rivals Chelsea, possibly without the influential Eden Hazard, host BATE Borisov of Belarus.  After sealing an impressive 10th straight victory at home to Leicester in the Premier League on Monday, Unai Emery's outfit are the team to watch in Group E.  Arsenal and Sporting sit on six points apiece after two games, with Azerbaijan's Qarabag and fellow strugglers Vorskla of Ukraine still pointless.  Sporting are fifth in Portugal's top flight, four points off the top with former Manchester United star Nani having scored three goals from seven league outings.  If Arsenal needed more reason to believe in their chances of going all the way, they need not look far. As coach of Sevilla in 2013-2016, Emery led the Spaniards to three consecutive Europa League titles.  ""We are beginning to play with heart,"" Emery said after Monday's come-from-behind 3-1 win, in which Mesut Ozil scored and provided an assist in a man-of-the-match performance.  ""I think we played some sexy football,"" said the 30-year-old German.  Sporting, who won 2-1 away to Loures in the Portuguese Cup with Nani and Bruno Fernandes both on target, should be fresher having played on Saturday.  Arsenal played on Monday and Emery, already set to make changes due to a packed schedule, is set to tinker further after both Nacho Monreal and Sead Kolasinac were ruled out.  ""Yesterday was a very bad day for injuries,"" Emery conceded on Tuesday.  'We Can Go All the Way'  Having won both their opening Group L matches, 2013 champions Chelsea can take a major step to the next round with a home win on Thursday, although they may have to do without Hazard.  The Belgian playmaker says he was kicked so much during Chelsea's 2-2 weekend draw with Manchester United that he will miss the Stamford Bridge game against BATE with a bad back.  ""When I woke up on Monday I was stiff. Even during the second half I couldn't accelerate properly,"" he said.  With Spanish centre-forward Alvaro Morata struggling on just three goals this season, Hazard's absence could rob Chelsea of their main attacking threat after a blistering seven-goal start to the Premier League campaign.  Yet Brazilian winger Willian remains upbeat about their chances, claiming the entire club has been given a lift by the arrival of new coach Maurizio Sarri.  ""The way we are playing this season, we can go all the way,"" the in-form winger said of their Europa League campaign.  As Marseille prepare to face Lazio, the French side will be hoping the past experience of coach Rudi Garcia pays dividends as they bid for their first win of the group stage following a 2-2 draw at Apollon Limassol. He joined them from Roma, where he faced Lazio five times in the capital-city derby and never lost.  ""Three wins and two draws in five games, I hope we can get a result like I used to in those Rome derbies,"" Garcia told AFP.  He added: ""I'll always have a little bit of Roma in my heart so that gives us added inspiration, but what counts here is winning, not punchlines.""

Rahul Chaudhari created history by becoming the first man to score 700 raid points in Pro Kabaddi but couldn't save his team from a defeat.  Desai scored 17 points and made life difficult for the Titans' defence throughout the match. He is also the leading raider of the Pro Kabaddi League Season VI with 83 points so far.  Chaudhari opened Telugu Titans' account with a raid in the first minute.  Desai got two quick raid points as U Mumba led 3-1 after two minutes.  Mohsen Magsudlou got into the act with Chaudhari as Titans scored five straight points to lead 6-3 in the seventh minute.  Desai continued his hot streak as he piled up points and pressure on the Telugu Titans defence.  In the 13th minute, Desai scored a super raid to give U Mumba 13-7 lead as they inflicted the first all out of the match.  Titans' defence found it difficult to contain Desai in the first half.  Chaudhari scored two raid points in two minutes as Titans reduced the deficit to 10-14. At the end of the first half U Mumba led 17-12.  The second half saw Desai at his best again as he scored with a super raid in the 21st minute to give U Mumba 20-12 lead.

A moment of history was created in the second half when Chaudhari scored a raid point to become the first man in PKL to reach the 700-raid point mark.  However, he wasn't able to revive his team's fortunes in the match.  U Mumba inflicted another all out in the 31st minute to open a massive 18-point lead.  In the last five minutes, U Mumba gave a run out to few of their bench players as they were ensured of a comfortable victory.  U Mumba collected a few tackle points in the last couple of minutes of the match to wrap up an easy 41-20 win.  In tomorrow's matches, Bengaluru Bulls will face Haryana Steelers and Puneri Paltan take on UP Yoddha.",SPORTS
Madrid Hand Lopetegui Respite With Nervy Win Over Plzen ,"It might not be enough to save Julen Lopetegui but Real Madrid's 2-1 Champions League win over Viktoria Plzen on Tuesday stopped the rot and restored some belief.  Barcelona are next at Camp Nou and even without the injured Lionel Messi, Madrid are unlikely to find them as generous if handed the sort of golden chances Plzen were presented with at the Santiago Bernabeu.  But after five games without a win, and three defeats in a row, victory was all-important, and Madrid secured it with a goal in each half from Karim Benzema and Marcelo.  It could have been more comfortable and when Patrik Hrosovsky pulled one back for Plzen with 12 minutes left, a nervy finale ensued. When it was over, there were disgruntled whistles from the home fans.  Lopetegui's side held on, however, to reassert themselves in Group G, where the reigning champions now sit level on six points with Roma.  Whether he is still in charge for the return fixture in the Czech Republic next month remains to be seen.  Florentino Perez may well have already made up his mind to make a change but there is still the question of timing.  Barcelona would be a cruel opening assignment for a new coach while defeat in a Clasico, perhaps a heavy one, could also kill any potential bounce.  Instead, Lopetegui was still on the touchline here, cajoling and clapping as his team created, and missed, more chances. Wincing as Plzen also squandered theirs.  He left all four of the club's summer signings on the bench including Alvaro Odriozola, who was replaced at right-back by Lucas Vazquez. Perhaps it was a coincidence, or perhaps a message to the board.  There was gentle applause when Lopetegui's name was announced before kick-off and Madrid's players started like they were trying for him too.  Sergio Ramos headed over and then against the post when twice allowed to run free but if they were eager up front, they were nervy at the back too.  Keylor Navas jabbed a difficult pass straight out of play and then had to make a save, as Milan Petrzela raced in behind Vazquez and was denied on the angle by Navas' thigh.  After weeks of agonising about scoring, Madrid then made it look easy. Vazquez, more comfortable going forward, chipped a cross to the back post, where the lively Benzema timed his run perfectly and nodded in from a yard.  Benzema and Isco both should have doubled the lead but opted to shoot when a pass would have given a tap-in. Bale and Toni Kroos each threw their arms up in frustration.  Plzen could have punished them as David Limbersky's chip floated wide before Petrzela feathered over from two yards with only Navas to beat. It was a dreadful miss and spared the blushes of Marcelo, who had sold himself on the opposite flank.  The full-back was absent again at the start of the second half when Milan Havel failed to connect with a cross to the back post.  But Marcelo's defensive frailties have always come with an attacking benefit and his chipped finish in the 55th minute gave Madrid the breathing space they craved. Bale's deft touch had sent him clear in the box.  Bale was freed by Benzema but his finish was blocked and Luka Modric's scooped through ball suggested Madrid were even enjoying themselves, as Bale joined Isco in being substituted.  Plzen, however, had other ideas and after Hrosovsky was allowed to ghost through Madrid's midfield, he curved the ball expertly past Navas' left hand and into the bottom corner.  Plzen smelt a point. Nacho had to hook the ball away from Michael Krmencik in the box as Madrid grew frantic. The visiting fans were cheering louder after full-time.",SPORTS
"India Fail to Break Malaysia's Citadel, Settle for Goalless Draw ","Muscat: Defending champions India missed chances galore to be held to a goalless draw by old nemesis Malaysia in their penultimate round-robin match but they still managed to progress to the semi-finals of the Asian Champions Trophy on Tuesday.

Champions League 'Dream' Awaits Monaco Coach Thierry Henry ,"Newly-appointed Monaco coach Thierry Henry has no intention of sulking over the Ligue 1 side's poor domestic form as he seeks a ""dream"" Champions League date with Club Brugge on Wednesday.  Former Arsenal and France star Henry kicked off his fledgling coaching career with a 2-1 away defeat to Strasbourg at the weekend, a result that left the struggling Principality side second from bottom of the French league table.  Monaco fans will be hoping it won't be more of the same on Wednesday, when they face the Belgians away looking to claim their first points of the group stages.  Henry, a Champions League winner with Barcelona in 2009, believes it could be just the tonic to get Monaco, beaten finalists in 2004, back on track.  ""People might ask if this match is coming at the right time for me, given our position in the table,"" Henry said in Bruges on Tuesday.  ""But they say the same about the teams leading the table, they say the Champions League can't be won by teams fighting for the (domestic) title.  ""I don't see it like that. The Champions League is a dream. You want to play in it, you want to be part of it and it might just be what we need to give us back some confidence.""  After succeeding Leonardo Jardim at the Monaco helm, in just one week Henry has ""introduced a degree of tactical flexibility"" into Monaco's game, said midfielder Youri Tielemans, who knows Henry well from his previous role as an assistant to Roberto Martinez in the Belgium set-up.  Henry expects a tough game at the Jan Breydelstadion against a team with ""quality"" players who ""know how to fight till the end"".  But the 41-year-old Frenchman has insisted on instilling a degree of optimism and is adopting a philosophical approach as he looks for the performance that will help Monaco believe again.  ""We're not in a situation where we can laugh about things, but we have to combine respect, humility, hard work and joy,"" said Henry.  ""It's always easier to work when there's joy.""  Henry's first game in charge as coach was marked by a 17th-minute opener for Strasbourg and a sending-off which left Monaco, now 24 points adrift of leaders Paris Saint-Germain, fighting for the scraps.  But the World Cup winner insists his Champions League debut as coach cannot come quick enough.  ""It's good for us to have this match right after Strasbourg, so we can try and regain some confidence and not think too much about certain things.  ""We're looking for a win or a really good performance as quickly as possible.""",SPORTS
Silvas Star as Manchester City Cruise Past Shakhtar Donetsk ,"Manchester City found their Champions League mojo as David Silva and Bernardo Silva both scored in a comfortable 3-0 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk in Kharkiv on Tuesday.  Pep Guardiola's men have now won back-to-back matches in Europe after a shock opening loss to Lyon, and lead the French side by one point at the top of Group F.  The English champions could potentially secure a last-16 spot if they beat Shakhtar in the return match at the Etihad in a fortnight's time as they bid for a maiden Champions League triumph.  David Silva put City ahead on the half-hour mark, before Aymeric Laporte doubled the advantage and Bernardo Silva scored just two minutes after coming off the bench.  Guardiola was able to give Kevin De Bruyne his first start of the season after the midfielder returned as a substitute against Burnley on Saturday following a two-month layoff with a knee injury.  City, the bookmakers' favourites for the European crown this term, started far better than in the two previous games which had seen them beaten 2-1 at home by Lyon and need a late David Silva winner to edge out Hoffenheim.  Riyad Mahrez fired wide midway through the opening half, before David Silva saw a header bounce away off the post.  But the Spanish winger made no mistake just seconds later, as he reacted quickest after Gabriel Jesus' shot was blocked and fired a magnificent volley low into the bottom corner.  The visitors did not need to wait long to pull further clear, and De Bruyne was the creator.  The Belgian's vicious 35th-minute corner was cleverly headed home by a totally unmarked Laporte, who did well to focus on the ball as John Stones leapt in front of him.  City continued to dominate after half-time, with David Silva seeing an effort cleared off the line and both Mahrez and Nicolas Otamendi shooting off target.  But the third goal arrived with 19 minutes to play as Bernardo Silva waltzed through the middle of the Shakhtar defence and drilled the ball in off the inside of the post.  Visiting goalkeeper Ederson Moraes kept out a late effort from Junior Moraes to preserve his clean sheet, as City claimed successive Champions League victories for the first time since winning their first five group-stage games last season.",SPORTS
Super Dorronsoro Garners a Point for Delhi Dynamos Against Chennaiyin FC ,"New Delhi: Goalkeeper Francisco Dorronsoro produced a stellar performance under the bar as Delhi Dynamos held defending champions Chennaiyin FC to an engaging goalless draw in a Hero Indian Super League match on Tuesday.  Chennaiyin FC had the better chances but could not beat the Spanish goalkeeper who refused to concede with brilliant saves throughout the match.  The visitors couldn't get a breakthrough but the point earned lifted them from the bottom of the table. Both the teams are still searching for their first win of the season.  Andrea Orlandi could have opened the scoring for Chennaiyin FC as early as the second minute of the match. The midfielder rose the highest to head a corner kick from Isaac V but Dorronsoro got down low to pull off a stunning reflex save.  Raphael Augusto then looked to be in the mood to score as the trickster surged up the field from midfield before taking aim from 40 yards but his piledriver lacked enough force to trouble Dorronsoro.  The Delhi goalkeeper was called into action again five minutes from half-time. A defence-splitting through-ball by Augusto released Carlos Salom behind the backline. The striker squared the ball to an unmarked Thoi Singh who took a touch before sending a powerful strike that was kept out.  Delhi's first shot of the game came at the stroke of half-time. Lallianzuala Chhangte beat his marker on the left flank, burst forward before crossing perfectly towards Andrija Kaludjerovic. The striker headed the ball first-time and forced goalkeeper Karanjit Singh to a save.  The hosts were struggling to find gaps at the other end. Kaludjerovic cut an isolated figure up front and crosses into the box were dealt well by the Chennaiyin backline.  The defending champions had a glorious chance to score a breakthrough goal in the 70th minute when a cleared corner kick turned into a counter-attack.  Augusto released Isaac into space down the left flank. The winger surged forward and squared the ball to an unmarked Salom whose shot was brilliantly saved by the onrushing goalkeeper.  The Delhi custodian put on a fine show under the bar. The Spaniard flew out from his line to punch away a delightful cross from the left by Thoi as the Lions held on for a point.",SPORTS

Bayern Edge Out AEK to Move Top of Group ,"Quick-fire goals by Javi Martinez and Robert Lewandowski on Tuesday moved Bayern Munich top of their Champions League group with a 2-0 win at AEK Athens, as they made it back-to-back victories after a difficult start to the season.  Dogged defending by the reigning Greek champions left Bayern facing a frustrating draw until Martinez finally broke through with an hour gone at AEK, who travel to the Allianz Arena in a fortnight's time.  ""It was very difficult, the pitch was not good, we played well in the first half, but the final pass was missing,"" said Arjen Robben.  ""We started using our chances and once Javi got the first goal, you could feel the relief. This was an important win for us.""  The result leaves Bayern top of Group E and puts pressure on nearest rivals Ajax, who earned a 1-1 draw in Munich three weeks ago, to beat Benfica in Amsterdam later on Tuesday and join the Germans on seven points, while AEK remain bottom after three straight defeats.  Bayern have never lost a European game in Greece, but despite breaking a four-match winless streak with a 3-1 victory at Wolfsburg on Saturday in the Bundesliga, the German champions laboured until Martinez scored with an athletic half-volley.  The hosts' best chance of the match came on the 20th minute when Argentinian striker Ezequiel Ponce held off Bayern defender Mats Hummels, but fired wide.  At the other end, Thiago Alcantara's pass rolled agonisingly away from Bayern striker Lewandowski.  Just as it was looking like AEK might earn their first point in the group stage, Bayern turned the game.  Hummels picked out Robben, whose effort was blocked, but the ball flew towards Martinez, who slammed his shot home.  Any frustrations in the Bayern ranks disappeared and just two minutes later they struck again.  Serge Gnabry, a constant threat on the right wing, played in Rafinha inside the box with a clever backheel, and the Brazilian's low cross found Lewandowski unmarked to tap home and delight the travelling fans.  It was Lewandowski's third goal in two games after also netting twice at Wolfsburg.  Thiago tried an acrobatic volley of his own with 15 minutes left which flew wide as Bayern kept on the pressure to safeguard the three points.",SPORTS
Federer Digs Deep to Reach Basel Second Round ,"Roger Federer had to fight hard to hold off Serbia's Filip Krajinovic on Tuesday, edging to a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 win to reach the second round of the Swiss Indoors.  The eight-time champion flirted with his earliest exit in Basel since his 1998 debut as a teenager, but came out on top in a nervy deciding set.  ""I also knew that he was feeling the pressure, that was something I needed,"" said Federer. ""It was a very close win, very tough.""  Earlier, Jan-Lennard Struff ended the possibility of a rematch between Federer and his US Open conqueror John Millman by beating the Australian 7-6 (7/3), 6-2.  Krajinovic appeared to be on the way to a straight-sets loss in his first meeting with the 20-time Grand Slam winner before the momentum began to turn.  Up a set and a break, the Swiss lost serve in the sixth game of the second set before his opponent managed to square the match with a break in game 10.  The top seed went up an early break in the third and broke Krajinovic in an 11-minute game for a 5-2 lead, only to fail to serve out the match at the first time of asking.  But he clinched victory on his second match point to take his career record at the tournament to 67-9 as he bids to reach a 12th successive final at St. Jakobshalle.  The 37-year-old Federer, who revealed earlier this week that he had been struggling with a hand injury since the grass-court season, last lost at the Swiss Indoors in 2013, going down to Juan Martin del Potro.  Seventh seed Daniil Medvedev, a semi-finalist last week in Moscow, saw off German Maximilian Marterer 6-3, 7-5.  Russian Medvedev stands at a career-high ranking of 20th, with three titles this season and will next face Andreas Seppi after the Italian defeated Japan's Taro Daniel 6-0, 6-4.",SPORTS
Never-Say-Die Esperance Reach CAF Champions League Final ,"Anice Badri scored his seventh CAF Champions League goal this season to give Esperance of Tunisia a 4-2 victory over Primeiro Agosto of Angola on Tuesday and a place in the final.  With 85 minutes played in the semi-final second leg, the Tunisians were leading 3-2 in Rades but trailing on away goals after losing the first leg 1-0 in Luanda.  Esperance goalkeeper Rami Jeridi then launched a long clearance that Haythem Jouini headed on and Badri took advantage of a deflection to score the decisive goal from close range.  It was the first time in the two-leg, 180-minute tie that Esperance led on aggregate and they survived a frenetic finish for a famous 4-3 overall victory.  Mohamed Belaili, Mohamed Ali Yakoubi, Jouini and Badri scored for Esperance and Geraldo and Lompala Bokamba for Primeiro in a seesaw showdown at the Stade Olympique near Tunis.  Geraldo put Primeiro ahead on eight minutes before Belaili converted a penalty and Yakoubi scored with a diving header to give the two-time African champions a 2-1 half-time lead.  A Jeridi howler gifted Bokamba an equaliser midway through the second half before a Jouini tap-in on 73 minutes edged Esperance 3-2 ahead on the night.  Primeiro thought they had scored a third goal soon after when Beadrik Ungenda netted in a goalmouth scramble, but it was ruled out by the overworked Zambian referee.  It was a surprise scoreline with Esperance scoring four goals for the first time in 12 matches and Primeiro conceding more than one in the Champions League for the first time this year.  Esperance will be away in the first leg of the final next month to Entente Setif of Algeria or Al Ahly of Egypt, who meet in Setif later Tuesday.  Record eight-time champions Ahly lead 2-0 from the first leg in Cairo and are expected to set up a repeat of the 2012 title decider in which they beat decades-old rivals Esperance.  There was plenty of off-field drama, too, with the flares that were flung on the pitch after the second Primeiro goal making visibility difficult.  Primeiro goalkeeper Adao 'Tony' Cabaca was affected by the smoke and after several appeals for medical assistance, eventually received help.  A small group of supporters played a cat-and-mouse game with the police, hurling various objects, retreating, then coming back to taunt them again.",SPORTS
Caroline Wozniacki Stands Firm to Stay Alive in Singapore ,"Caroline Wozniacki overcame a mid-match wobble and withstood a barrage of big hitting to get her WTA Finals title defence back on track with a 7-5 3-6 6-2 victory over Petra Kvitova at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Tuesday.  Both players came into the contest on the back of opening defeats in round robin play but the Danish world number three ended a run of four straight defeats to the Czech to stay alive in the eight-woman tournament for at least one more match.  Wozniacki, who started her White Group campaign with a 6-2 6-4 loss to Karolina Pliskova on Sunday, spent most of the match against Kvitova pinned on the baseline but her consistency and patience proved vital as she pulled away in the final set.  ""I played much better today. I served and returned pretty well, and moved really well against a player who is so powerful that you have to stay on your game,"" Wozniacki said  ""You never know what is going to happen against Petra, so I just stayed focused and got a lot of balls back.""  The match was a cagey affair from the outset with seven holds of serve in a row. But after they traded breaks as the intensity levels picked up, Wozniacki broke again to seal the opener when Kvitova blasted a forehand into the net.  Kvitova took control of the second set with an early break, then lost momentum when Wozniacki took a timeout for treatment on her knee, before she regained the upper hand to level the match with a sliced backhand winner on her third set point.  Sensing her title defence was in tatters, Wozniacki regrouped to break at the start of the decider when she put away a backhand to win the longest rally of the match, and ran away with the contest as Kvitova wilted in the final set.  The 28-year-old Wozniacki sealed victory on her first match point with a big serve that Kvitova sent long, and will hope to win her final match of round robin play against Elina Svitolina to secure a semi-final berth.  ""I just always believe in myself, that I am going to win when I go out on court. I was just out there, had the belief and fought to the end,"" Wozniacki added.  The Ukrainian Svitolina, who beat Kvitova in her opening match, takes on big-serving Czech Pliskova in Tuesday's second match with the winner almost virtually assured of advancing to the last four.

ISL 2018/19: FC Goa Hoping to Keep Momentum Going Against Mumbai City ,"Goa: Having registered their first victory of the season, FC Goa would look to keep the winning momentum going when they take on Mumbai City FC at home in a Hero Indian Super League match here on Wednesday.  With four points from two games, the Gaurs have made a positive start to the fifth season of the tournament.   Sergio Lobera's men would have been a little disappointed to walk away with a 2-2 draw in their opening fixture against NorthEast United FC but made their intentions clear in the next game with a stunning 3-1 win away from home against defending champions Chennaiyin FC.  Despite losing the services of prolific playmaker Manuel Lanzarote to ATK, Goa boasts of strong attacking line and they proved that by scoring five goals scored in two matches so far.  Last season's Golden Boot winner Ferran Corominas has shown no signs of slowing down and has already scored three goals in two appearances.  ""We always try to play an attacking brand of football and the idea is to win the game. That's the most important thing. If you're asking me if we are going to attack less so that we don't concede, the answer is no. The idea is simple which is to try and attack like we did last year,"" said Goa coach Lobera.  In defence, Mourtada Fall has been an excellent addition with the Senegalese adept at bringing the ball out from the back. Chinglensana Singh too has shown improvement in his defensive abilities.  Mumbai City, on the other hand, come into game on the back of an impressive 2-0 win over FC Pune City in the first Maharashtra derby of the season.   Jorge Costa's men had a stuttering start to their campaign with a home defeat against Jamshedpur FC followed by a 1-1 draw against Kerala Blasters.  ""Goa have a very good team and a very good coach. It's easy to understand what they want to do on the pitch. I will not speak of individual players but we are going to have a difficult game for sure. We respect them a lot but we also know what to do,"" said Costa.  Costa will be glad to see Senegalese strike Modou Sougou get off the mark against Pune. He would also be hoping for Brazilian Rafael Bastos to find his form after a lacklustre start to the campaign.   Mumbai's attack had been toothless at the start with the Brazilian struggling for any rhythm but his penalty against Pune might just get his confidence back.   Arnold Issoko has looked like an inspired buy for Mumbai with the Congolese showing his prowess in a man-of-the-match display in the Maharashtra derby. ",SPORTS
I-League: Debutants Real Kashmir Hoping Home Comforts Help in Making it Another Year to Remember ,"New Delhi: For a state like Jammu and Kashmir that has been battling to survive the onslaught that results from a fractious relationship between India and Pakistan, the emergence of Real Kashmir FC in Srinagar has not only brought top flight football to the state for the first time but also is a breath of fresh air.   The club began their journey in 2016 after co-owners Shamim Meraj and Sandeep Chattoo felt it was essential to provide the youth of the state a positive outlet.  “It is a great feeling for us that we are the first team from our state to play in the I-League. Many young boys and girls are playing football nowadays and we feel happy seeing that,” Danish Farooq, the 22-year-old who’s penalty helped the team achieve qualification, said.  Having qualified for the top flight at the expense of Hindustan FC from Delhi in May, the David Robertson-managed side is looking to make a mark in the country’s premier competition, the I-League. The debutants will open their campaign against the defending champions Minerva Punjab (October 31st) in Panchkula, before heading back for a string of home games. Their first home game will be against Goan side Churchill Brothers on November 6th.  Coach Robertson, who has roped in his son Mason into the squad as one of the six foreigners, understands the upcoming season will not be an easy one for his side. The Scot not only has kept his eyes and ears open as he tried to blend talent, experience and youth into his side, but also emphasised that the players coming in needed to be able to keep up the team spirit and camaraderie.  “We begin our journey against the champions (Minerva Punjab) away from home before coming back for six games. That’s where we need to capitalise and get our points, because otherwise suddenly you’ll be in a position of no return and getting demoted will be terrible for the team and the people,” Robertson explains on the sidelines of a promotional event with sportswear giants Adidas. The German company are the kit sponsors for Real Kashmir FC.  “It will definitely be difficult to be one of the title contenders for the season, but I believe with a bit of luck we can finish hopefully in the top half.”  Local Support Can be Our 12th Man  Initially, there was a possibility that Real Kashmir would not be able to play their home games at their favoured Tourist Reception Centre (TRC) ground, but after multiple inspections following the upgradation of facilities, the stadium will play host to its first I-League game on November 6th.  The team’s coach and players were relieved that they will play their home game in Srinagar and an elated club co-owner Shamim Meraj said, “We have things in place (to host I-League games). The capacity of the ground is 10,000 but we will have to cap it to around 6,000 to ensure everything goes smoothly.”  On the big opening day, security arrangements are expected to be boosted as both club and authorities want things to go through without a hiccup.  “I am expecting to see a very noisey bunch at the ground. I’ve seen how a crowd can motivate players and teams and I hope the local crowd in Srinagar can do the same, be our 12th man,” Robertson, the former Aberdeen and Rangers FC player, said.  However, more than a vibrant crowd what is more likely to fit the home advantage bill for Real Kashmir will be the difficult conditions traveling teams will face in Srinagar.  Club captain Loveday Enyinnaya, a Nigerian professional who has turned out for a whole host of Indian clubs like Malabar United F.C., Royal Wahingdoh F.C., Sporting clube de Goa and Minerva Punjab F.C., believes his side is not under any pressure and that it will be up to the others to play well against them in difficult conditions.  “It will be difficult for teams coming to play against us because of the weather. When I had come here initially, I faced problems with the cold to start with, but now I have adjusted. The others won’t find it easy,” says Loveday with a mischievous grin.",SPORTS
"AIFF Intent on Restructuring Indian Football, But Road Ahead Remains Unclear ","Ahead of the 2017/18 edition of the I-League, the biggest talking point among fans and experts alike was the fact that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) had decided to keep the Indian football team that featured in the FIFA U-17 World Cup together as the ‘Indian Arrows’ in a bid to further develop the burgeoning talents.   Yet perhaps the biggest elephant in the room – the fact that the I-League and the Indian Super League (ISL) would be running simultaneously for the first time ahead of a major restructure of the domestic football system – was not addressed at the time.   One year later and with the potential threat of an Asian ban looming should they fail to unify the two leagues by the 2019/20 season, the AIFF unsurprisingly chose to address the issue head on.   “Let us look at the bigger picture. We are talking about restructuring the league and we have a holistic plan for that where we are going to take all the leagues into account and make a better league structure so that India can perform better internationally,” AIFF senior vice-president Subrata Dutta said at the I-League launch in New Delhi on Tuesday.   Yet while it was refreshing to hear that the AIFF were finally looking to merge the two domestic leagues, there are a number of issues that must be addressed before the huge decision is finally taken.   Earlier this year, news broke of a FIFA-backed report that suggested an Asian ban for Indian clubs should they fail to come up with a unified league by the next season.   The report was refuted by AIFF general secretary Kushal Das, who stated that he was yet to receive any report from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and that a decision will be taken in due course.   Complicated Roadmap   However, coming up with a new system will be complicated to say the least considering the fact that an arrangement currently exists that sees the ISL clubs get a 10-year immunity from relegation from 2014 onwards.   Even though the FIFA report called for a review of that and some other arrangements, there is every possibility that it could be upheld even after it is evaluated by the necessary authorities.   This would mean that ISL clubs will not be relegated from 2019-23 while I-League clubs will be both promoted and relegated as the report stated that the new league must become a 16-team tournament by 2023.   More tellingly, this arrangement will see the majority of the I-League clubs – which include legacy sides like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan among others – excluded from the new merged league, at least in the initial stages.   For his part, Dutta stated that it would be unwise to view the leagues individually as the plan was to eventually freshen up the whole domestic league system in India.   “We should not analyse just one league. We should include ISL, we should include I-League and we should include age-group leagues as well as think about the second division league since they all add value to football in our country,” Dutta said.   Yet to not view the ISL and I-League as separate entities given the differing natures of both tournaments is something of an exercise in futility.   One league has been in existence for only five years and has massive financial backing whereas the other began in 1996 as the National Football League and features some of India’s most successful clubs yet has never had the kind of exposure the new league did.   There’s also the fact that I-League clubs tend to enjoy better in-stadium attendance, something the ISL has struggled with especially after the league began to run for longer than two months.   Including the ISL clubs in the revamped league structure makes sense given the amount of money that has been invested in them, yet a truly holistic approach will be needed if the benefits of the reforms are to be enjoyed by all Indian clubs.

Facing Atletico is like 'Toothache' for Dortmund Goal-ace Paco Alcacer ,"Goal machine Paco Alcacer says playing against Atletico Madrid feels like 'toothache' -- and he hopes to extract maximum revenge for past suffering when Borussia Dortmund meet them in Wednesday's Champions League clash.   The 26-year-old, on loan from Barcelona, has needed just 109 minutes to score seven Bundesliga goals this season -- the best goal-rate in the league's history, which included a deft chip in Saturday's 4-0 drubbing of Stuttgart to keep Dortmund top of the table.  In total, Alcacer has netted 11 goals in his last seven games for club and country, but now has Atletico in his sights for the Group A showdown with both teams having won their first two games.  ""A toothache to play against Atletico? Well, yes, totally,"" Alcacer told Spanish newspaper Marca, having lost six of his nine games against Atletico for either former clubs Getafe or Valencia. He never faced them while with Barcelona.  ""They are a team that concede very few goals and they leave few spaces, while they're always very aware of everything.  ""For a striker, it's frustrating.""  However, his form has been anything but 'frustrating' since arriving in Dortmund in August after two unhappy seasons at Barcelona, where his path to the first-team was blocked by Luiz Suarez.  Alcacer's goal exploits quickly wrote him into Dortmund's footballing folklore.  ""The freedom is playing, having minutes and enjoying the profession. I didn't have the minutes at Barcelona and now I am having them, things are going well,"" he added.  'Always in my Mind, Papa'  However, each goal he scores also carries a tragic reminder.  When he scored at Stuttgart on Saturday, he raised his arms to celebrate, as does after each goal, and looked to the heavens with the words ""Always in my mind, Papa"" tattooed on his left bicep.  Alcacer was still a teenager when his world was turned upside down on the first game of the 2011/12 season.  His father Francisco died of a heart-attack while leaving the stadium after watching his son play in a friendly for former club Valencia against Roma.  His father would no doubt be proud of what his son has achieved in just a few weeks at Dortmund, who have told Barcelona they want to sign him permanently, with his value estimated at around 30 million euros ($34.4m).  Alcacer endeared himself to Dortmund fans by scoring on his debut off the bench against Eintracht Frankfurt in mid September.  In his next game, he added two more, again as a sub, against Leverkusen.  Then followed a stunning hat-trick in just 31 minutes as a second-half replacement against Augsburg on October 6, which included a stunning 96th-minute winner by banging in a superb free-kick just before the final whistle to seal a 4-3 comeback win.  ""We had hoped that he would fit, but we hadn't dared hope that he would score like that,"" admitted Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc.  On top of his Bundesliga goals, Alcacer also scored in the 3-0 win at home to Monaco at the start of the month, then claimed three goals in two games last week on his return to the Spain team after a two year hiatus.   Now comes Atletico, led by their French goal-king Antoine Griezmann, and Alcacer could well be the source of an uncomfortable night for the Spanish team at Signal Iduna Park.  ""It's clear that Atletico are a great team and a great club, a top club. But we need to make things difficult for them and go from there,"" said Alcacer.",SPORTS

The seventh seed Indian will now clash with Egypt's Mohammed Safwat for a place in the quarterfinals. Prajnesh has beaten Swafwat thrice this season.

Infantino Plans for New Global Tournaments Back on FIFA Agenda ,"Manchester: FIFA president Gianni Infantino's plans for two new global tournaments are back on the agenda at the governing body with soccer officials set to discuss the proposals on Friday.  FIFA's ruling council meets in Kigali, Rwanda and Infantino's plan for a new 'mini World Cup' and an expanded Club World Cup feature among the items for discussion according to the agenda document.  FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment and it was not clear if the plans will be put to a vote.  Infantino wrote to FIFA Council members in May outlining his plans which he says are backed by a 'solid and serious' group of investors willing to spend $25 billion over a 12-year cycle starting in 2021.  The letter did not outline the identity of the investors but several media reports have stated that Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group is heading the consortium.  However, the plans were strongly opposed by clubs and leagues in Europe and UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said the plans were 'highly cynical and ruthless mercantilism' and accused FIFA of selling the soul of the game.  The plans did not feature on the agenda of FIFA's congress in Moscow in June.  Infantino's proposals would bring about major changes to the international calendar.  The proposals outline what would effectively be a mini-World Cup, featuring eight international teams, every two years in addition to the traditional event.  The tournament, known as the 'Final 8', would be the climax of a proposed global Nations League competition.  In the May letter, it was suggested that the new tournament would take place every October and/or November of every odd year starting from 2021. The Confederations Cup, currently staged every four years in a year before the World Cup, would be abolished.  The annual Club World Cup, which currently features seven teams, would be expanded to 24 teams and moved to once every four years, according to the proposals.",SPORTS
Smart Assistant Technology Puts F1 Fans' Fingers on the Pulse ,"U.S. Grand Prix winner Kimi Raikkonen has always been known as 'The Iceman' but Formula One fans could soon have much more of an insight into just how cool he really is in the heat of battle.  The winner of this year's $50,000 Tata Communications F1 Innovation Prize aims to harness smart assistant technology, such as Amazon's Alexa, so that fans can customise their experience of a race.  Briton James Gough's idea would deliver personalised, contextual data to fans through voice, text, and gesture command.  So, for example, if someone wanted to compare Raikkonen's heart-rate to that of current Ferrari team mate Sebastian Vettel or Mercedes' world champion Lewis Hamilton during a race, they could do so with a voice command.  Ross Brawn, Formula One's managing director for motorsports, hailed it as a development that the Liberty Media-owned sport would incubate further as part of its digital transformation.  ""We want to see where this takes us,"" he told Reuters.  ""It's a fascinating area, the engagement of fans and the whole technological side. And it's moving so quickly. So it fits perfectly with what we are doing in Formula One and where we're heading.  ""Imagine you are sat there watching a race and you say to your assistant 'How do the tyre temperatures compare on those two cars?' Ping! up it comes. That would be another level of engagement for a fan.  ""'What's the heart rate of the two drivers fighting out at the front of the grid?' Ping! Up it comes.""  Brawn said there was still some resistance to change, with teams protective of data and wary of divulging too many secrets, but there was also a growing understanding that Formula One was entering a new world.  ""This is going to be the next phase of fan engagement in Formula One. The fact that you pick your profile and cocktail of viewing you want and you vary it and shape it exactly how you want it,"" he said.  ""It's like listening to a playlist. Someone's put together their music and you start there and modify it to suit you. Everyone's experience is different.""  HAMILTON KEEN  Hamilton, who can clinch his fifth world championship in Mexico this weekend, said he liked the idea of that and of making the sport more accessible.  ""There are ways of thinking within the sport that have not shifted for many years. But we are in a period of time where Formula One does need to move forward so it's really great,"" he told Reuters.  ""There are so many people in my family who do not understand what is going on,"" he added. ""You just see cars going around, you can't relate to it... there are so many areas in which you are not getting information.  ""People are always asking about the weight, about how physical it is, how hard it is... But if you can utilise data to really explain those parameters and why it is so hard, I think it will just naturally make people more excited.""  Vinod Kumar, chief executive of Tata Communications who work with Formula One as 'technology enablers', said the winning idea catered for both the sophisticated fan and those relatively new to the sport.  He said all sports were entering new territory, with real life and virtual experiences beginning to converge thanks to technology.  ""It's going to be a far more immersive experience and then there will be a blurring of lines between what physically takes place and what virtually takes place,"" he said of the future.  ""I love the fact that in the winning idea there is an integration of personal assistant technology. That's going to become pervasive and it will allow fans to get involved deeper and deeper in the sports.  ""Formula One is perfectly suited to it because its technologically is so advanced and always at the forefront and I think there's an opportunity for Formula One to lead the way for many other sports.""",SPORTS
A-League Club Central Coast Mariners Confirm Offer to Olympic Champion Bolt ,"Sydney: Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt has been offered a professional contract by Australian A-League outfit the Central Coast Mariners but a deal is unlikely without an external third party financial contribution, the club said on Tuesday.  The 32-year-old Jamaican, a passionate football fan, has been on trial at the club since August as he attempts to make an audacious switch to a second professional sport after one of the most decorated careers in athletics.  ""The club can confirm that a contract proposal has been offered by the Central Coast Mariners and negotiations remain ongoing with Usain Bolt and his management regarding his football future,"" the Mariners said in a statement.  ""The Central Coast Mariners want to ensure that Usain Bolt is given every chance possible to fulfil his dream to become a professional football player.""  Despite two goals in one pre-season friendly, Bolt's performances for the Mariners have not been overly impressive and manager Mike Mulvey suggested at the weekend that the Jamaican would not on current form be worth a place in his side.  The club said Bolt had made ""great progression"" in his time at the Gosford-based club and they were looking at ways to give him ""more individual intensive training and competitive game time"" but that it would have to be away from the A-League.  The club statement said the other main discussion point in negotiations was around commercial matters.  'COMMERCIAL SOLUTION'  Football Federation Australia (FFA) has made it clear that the ""marquee"" money that has in the past helped Australian clubs lure the likes of Italian forward Alessandro Del Piero to the A-League would not be available to sign Bolt.  Home crowds for the Mariners last season averaged just over 7,000 but the club said that while they would need third party help to fund a deal, media reports that it could be worth as little as A$150,000 ($106,185) a season were ""inaccurate"".  ""Usain Bolt's management and the Central Coast Mariners are in conversations with external partners to find a commercial solution that suits all parties,"" read the statement.  ""Without the financial contribution of an external third-party, it is unlikely that Usain Bolt and the Central Coast Mariners will agree to terms.""  According to Forbes, eight-times Olympic gold medallist Bolt was earning upwards of $20 million a year mostly from endorsements before his retirement from athletics in 2017.  Last week, he turned down an offer of a two-year contract from Maltese outfit Valletta FC and his representatives have made it clear that he is the subject of interest from other European clubs.  Bolt will not train with the Mariners until a deal is finalised, the statement added.",SPORTS
Lionel Messi Injury Gives Barcelona and Dembele Chance to Prove Their Worth ,"Barcelona's lowest ebbs are invariably followed by questions about Lionel Messi but the issue of over-reliance may become clearer over the coming weeks.  The sight of Messi on the ground, grasping his right arm, during Barca's win over Sevilla on Saturday prompted reactions inside Camp Nou normally reserved for the conceding of goals.   Hands behind heads, fingers over mouths, the concern became real shortly after the final whistle when the club confirmed Messi had fractured his radial bone.   His absence leaves Barca vulnerable when they need him most, for a run of fixtures that includes Inter Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday, the Clasico against Real Madrid on Sunday, before a return match against Inter in Italy at the start of next month.   If he takes longer than expected to recover, he could miss tricky games against Real Betis and Atletico Madrid in La Liga too.   Barcelona have grown used to accusations of dependence, not least when results have taken a turn for the worse.   When Ernesto Valverde left Messi on the bench for the 1-1 draw at home to Athletic Bilbao last month, the argument was given added weight by him coming on and making the assist for their equaliser.   ""This is Barcelona,"" Messi afterwards. ""We have a strong team and we have enough not to have to depend on one player.""   The same point was raised last season, when Messi, as a substitute, inspired a late fightback from two goals down against Sevilla and scored in the 89th minute.   He played the entirety of the Champions League collapse against Roma but then the criticism was Barca had failed to find the answer when Messi had not provided it.  There is no team in the world that would not look worse with Messi extracted.   'Casting for Replacements'  As Real Madrid are proving in the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo, a striker's goals are difficult to replace but so too is the aura.   ""Emotionally we know when Messi is there he gives us more confidence because he is the best in the world,"" Pique said on Saturday. ""But it does not have to affect us.""   To maintain a resurgence built on wins over Tottenham and Sevilla, as well as a draw away to Valencia, Valverde will have to find the solution.   On Monday, Marca listed six options in a ""casting for replacements"" - Ousmane Dembele, Rafinha, Munir El Haddadi, Malcom, Carles Alena and Sergi Roberto.   Alena, the 20-year-old midfielder, is an exciting talent, while Malcom, only a year older, scored 12 goals for Bordeaux last season.   But Dembele is the most obvious. Messi's position on the right of the front three is where he is most comfortable, rather than off the left, where the 21-year-old has often been made to adapt so far.   After a debut season blighted by injuries, Dembele started the first six games of this one, scoring five goals.   But doubts remain about him in big games, where his habit for losing possession can be punished by opponents quick in transition and clinical on the counter-attack.   When Barca went three matches without a win, he was dropped. ""He is not yet fully aware of what it means to play at the highest level,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps last month. ""He still needs to learn,"" Valverde said last weekend.   It would be a surprise if Dembele was not at least given the chance at Camp Nou against Inter, who are level on points with Barca in Group B, having also beaten PSV Eindhoven and Tottenham.   Second place might have been the limit of Inter's ambitions when the draw was made but with Messi out, they might spy an opportunity. ""It is a pity,"" said Mauro Icardi. ""And a big blow for them.""",SPORTS
Returning Cristiano Ronaldo Out to Heap Pressure on Old Club Man United ,"Cristiano Ronaldo hopes to pile more pressure on his old club Manchester United and put allegations of rape to one side when he steps out for Italian giants Juventus at Old Trafford in the Champions League Tuesday.   Ronaldo made his name in Manchester, winning the first of his five Champions League and three Premier League titles under the tutelage of Alex Ferguson, for whom he still retains the highest regard.  ""To return here to Manchester for me is a huge emotion. When we were drawn together I remembered the history I made here. I won all the trophies: Champions League, leagues, cups,"" said a smiling Ronaldo in a pre-match press conference.  ""I remembered the incredible fans and a person that I don't forget, who was one of the people that helped me most, Sir Alex Ferguson.""  However, Ronaldo also inflicted one of Ferguson's biggest disappointments.  Having swapped Manchester for Real Madrid for a world record fee in 2009, Ronaldo was given a hero's welcome in his only previous return to Old Trafford but ultimately scored the winning goal to edge a contentious Champions League last-16 tie in the Spanish side's favour in 2013.  That proved to be Ferguson's final European match, and in the legendary Scot's retirement, United have fallen on hard times in Europe.  In the five years since, Ronaldo has won the Champions League four times with Madrid, while United have won just one knockout tie in Europe's top club competition.  More Than Contenders   Both sides are on course to make the last 16 this season. Juventus top Group H with a perfect record from comfortable victories over Young Boys and Valencia and United have taken four points from a possible six against the same opponents.  However, in large part due to Ronaldo's talismanic status in the Champions League, it is Juventus, who paid Madrid 112 million euros ($129 million) for the 33-year-old in July, and not United, who are being touted as contenders to win the competition, even by the English side's own manager Jose Mourinho.  ""As far as I'm concerned, Juventus are more than just a contender this season to win the Champions League,"" said Mourinho.  ""They have a really special player (Ronaldo), who makes a real difference as well.""  Top scorer in the Champions League for the past six seasons, Ronaldo has been made to wait to make an impact for Juventus.   Sent-off just half an hour into his European debut for the club at Valencia, he also sat out a 3-0 win over Young Boys three weeks ago due to suspension.  ""My last two months in Juve was amazing. Everything goes well, my adaptation goes well, and the team is amazing,"" insisted Ronaldo, despite the off-field turmoil.  A former American model Kathryn Mayorga, 34, has accused Ronaldo of raping her on June 13, 2009, just before he joined Real Madrid from United. Ronaldo has vigorously denied the allegations and has been backed by his new club.  ""It doesn't matter if I play or get sent-off. The most important (thing) is that we have six points, we are in a good position and I'm glad to be back,"" he added.  The threat of a hungry Ronaldo is dangerous for Mourinho, who is still under pressure despite encouraging recent results.  United battled back from behind for a dramatic 3-2 win over Newcastle and a creditable 2-2 draw at Chelsea on Saturday, but are still languishing nine points off the top of the Premier League in 10th.  ""I think the last games proved that we can play, press forward and we have players to make the difference,"" insisted United striker Romelu Lukaku.  ""The challenge of tomorrow is to win the game against a really difficult side, but we'll do our best and see where we stand against one of the best teams in Europe.”",SPORTS
Last-gasp Spurs Fightback Thwarts LeBron James and Lakers ,"An overtime fightback from the San Antonio Spurs left LeBron James waiting for his first win with the Los Angeles Lakers in a high-scoring thriller at the Staples Center on Monday.  San Antonio ran out 143-142 winners after two late free throw misses from James allowed Patty Mills to drain a jump shot for the Spurs with seven seconds remaining to snatch victory.  Mills' late winner was the final act of a pulsating battle which saw the Lakers overturn a 128-120 deficit with a minute left in the fourth quarter to force overtime, with James raising the roof with a three-pointer to tie the game.  James had looked poised to lead the Lakers to their first victory of the regular season after they surged into a 141-136 lead with 55 seconds of overtime remaining.  But San Antonio regrouped to come storming back and when James missed two free throws that would have given the Lakers a three-point lead, Mills struck to give the Spurs the win.  The defeat left James reflecting on his first 0-3 start to the season since his rookie NBA year in 2003.  The 33-year-old was able to draw positives from the loss, however.  ""I know what I got myself into,"" James told reporters. ""It's a process. We'll be fine. I didn't come here thinking we were going to be blazing storms right out the gate.  ""We're going to continue to get better. I like the direction we're going in. Obviously we haven't got the results or the wins yet, but it's a long process.""  LaMarcus Aldridge led the scoring for San Antonio with 37 points while DeMar DeRozan added 32.  Kyle Kuzma top scored for the Lakers with 37 points as James finished with 32 points.  Lakers coach Luke Walton said his team could take positives from the game despite the defeat.  ""Overall, very pleased with our guys tonight,"" Walton said. ""That's three games we've had a chance to win now. Obviously it's about winning and losing at the end of the day.   ""It's a tough one to take but we'll be back in the gym tomorrow doing it all over again.""  Warriors Romp   Elsewhere Monday, reigning NBA Finals champions the Golden State Warriors improved to 3-1 in the Western Conference with a 123-103 demolition of the Phoenix Suns in Oakland.  Stephen Curry led the scoring with 29 points, 18 of his tally coming from three-point range. Kevin Durant added 22 points while Klay Thompson added 16.  Earlier, Nikola Vucevic weighed in with 24 points as the Orlando Magic defeated the Boston Celtics at the TD Garden in an Eastern Conference upset.  Montenegrin center Vucevic also hauled down 12 rebounds to give Orlando their second win of the season in a 93-90 victory.  Orlando surged into an early 28-19 lead at the end of the first quarter and held a 48-45 lead at half-time.  The Magic kept their noses in front for the entire contest, with Boston unable to take the lead at any stage as Orlando held on.   Four other Orlando players cracked double figures on a night when the scoring was shared around by the visitors.   Jonathan Isaac had 18 points while Evan Fournier (14) and Aaron Gordon (13) also contributed.  Boston, tipped as one of the favorites for the Eastern Conference title this season, struggled to get going.   Kyrie Irving finished with 22 points but it was a frustrating evening for the rest of the Celtics line-up with Al Horford restricted to 15 points and Gordon Hayward 11.   The Celtics had a chance to tie the game late in the fourth quarter but Hayward's three-pointer missed as the buzzer sounded.  In other games on Monday, the Toronto Raptors maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a 127-106 blowout over the Charlotte Hornets.  Kemba Walker had 26 points for Charlotte but the Raptors all-round scoring proved too much for the visitors.   Kawhi Leonard led the scoring for Toronto with 22 points, while four other players chipped in with double-digit tallies.   Jonas Valanciunas had 17 points off the bench while Kyle Lowry and Danny Green made 16 points apiece as the Raptors improved to 4-0.",SPORTS

"Narayan Thakur: 100m Gold Winner in Asian Para Games Once Lived in Orphanage, Cleaned DTC Buses ","New Delhi: Narayan Thakur — who was born with a disability, lived in an orphanage for eight years, worked at dhabas, cleaned DTC buses — has achieved the near-impossible by becoming the only Indian to have won the athletics 100m Gold in the just concluded Asian Para Games in Jakarta.   A report in The Time of India said that Thakur suffers from left-sided hemiparesis, a condition in which a patient suffers paralysis of the left side of the body after a stroke of the brain.   The story of the 27-year-old para athlete, who even lived for a while in a jhuggi in northwest Delhi’s Samaypur Badli, is one of indomitable spirit overcoming all odds.  Thakur, who hails from Bihar, says the family moved to Delhi as his father was suffering from a heart condition. After his father's death, his mother was finding it difficult to take care of her three kids and it was then that Thakur was sent to an orphanage in Daryaganj. The young sprinter claims he got food to eat and a chance to study there.  “I wanted to play cricket, but somehow it did not happen. I left the orphanage so that I could look for other alternatives in sports,” Thakur told The Times of India.  Thakur says when he left the orphanage in 2010, his family suffered another cruel blow.  “That was the time when the jhuggis we in Samaypur Badli, where we lived then, were demolished. We had no option but to move to a nearby area. We had serious financial problems and to make ends meet I had to clean DTC buses and also double up as waiter at small roadside thelas (stalls). But I still had the spirit to pursue sports,” Thakur told The Times of India.   Thakur said the transition to athletics happened when someone advised him to try his hand at the sport at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium.   Once there, Thakur said he worked hard on his game and impressed all with his performance. This paved the way for his participation in the Jakarta Games.  “I am happy to have won the gold for India in Jakarta. I am the only Indian to have won the athletics 100m gold in an Asiad or Asian Para Games,” Thakur was quoted as saying by the paper.  Thakur was felicitated by the PM for his outstanding feat and given a cheque of Rs 40 lakh. He said he hopes to get some financial reward from the Delhi government as well.   Thakur, who doesn't have a job and helps his mother run a paan shop, is now optimistic that his life will change for good.",SPORTS
"Aubameyang, Ozil Star Against Leicester as Arsenal Make it Perfect 10 ","London: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mesut Ozil stole the show as Arsenal swept to their 10th successive win with a dominant 3-1 victory against Leicester on Monday.  Unai Emery's side trailed to Hector Bellerin's first-half own goal at the Emirates Stadium.  But Ozil, captaining Arsenal on his return to the side after back spasms, produced a majestic display to lead the Gunners' impressive fightback.  Ozil, shrugging off his poor start to the season, equalised just before half-time and played a key role in Aubameyang's second-half double.  Gabon striker Aubameyang scored twice in quick succession after coming off the bench, ensuring Arsenal won 10 consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time since 2007.  They have scored 30 goals in that blistering streak and climb to fourth place in the Premier League, just two points behind leaders Manchester City.  On the 69th birthday of Emery's predecessor Arsene Wenger, this was the kind of swashbuckling show that recalled Arsenal's glory days under the Frenchman.  Ozil summed up Arsenal mood, tweeting after the match: ""I think we played some sexy football tonight. Proud captain of this team.""  It was the perfect start to a hectic week that sees Arsenal travel to Portugal for a Europa League tie against Sporting Lisbon on Thursday before returning to domestic action at Crystal Palace on Sunday.  ""We are happy because we are progressing. We need to play with organisation but also we are beginning to play with heart,"" Emery said.  ""Today the performance of the team, and also of Mesut, was very good.""  Emery has made a remarkable impact since replacing Wenger in the close-season.  The Spanish manager's two-game losing streak at the start of his Arsenal reign is now a distant memory as Gunners fans start to dream of a title challenge after their seventh successive league win.  Emery isn't getting carried away just yet, saying: ""It's important to keep calm and progress with every player. To continue winning is difficult.  ""When you improve your demands are very high. We need to control matches more than we are doing now.""  Leicester boss Claude Puel was furious his side didn't get a penalty for a first-half handball by Rob Holding.  ""I am angry about this decision because the good work from my players was not helped,"" he said.  Driving forward  Leicester's spot-kick claim came when Holding raised his arm above his head and clearly handled as he jumped to meet Jamie Vardy's flick-on, yet referee Christopher Kavanagh waved play on.  Harry Maguire's towering header forced a good save from Leno and Leicester's pressure reaped a tangible reward in the 31st minute.  Wilfried Ndidi's pass picked out Ben Chilwell, who made a superb run in behind Bellerin and drilled a low shot that deflected off the Arsenal defender on its way past the wrong-footed Leno.  Stunned into action by that setback, Arsenal nearly snatched an immediate equaliser when Granit Xhaka's free-kick was tipped over by Kasper Schmeichel.  Suddenly, Arsenal were driving forward with purpose and they drew level on the stroke of half-time.  Ozil was the catalyst as his pass sent Bellerin away down the right and when the defender crossed into the Leicester area, it was the German midfielder who timed his run perfectly to guide a delicate finish into the far corner.  Ndidi led the Leicester response with a powerful header that rattled the bar from James Maddison's corner.  But Emery sent on Aubameyang for Lichtsteiner after 61 minutes and the switch paid instant dividends two minutes later.  Ozil played a superb pass to Bellerin and the Spaniard's low cross was just right for the unmarked Aubameyang to slot home from close range.  Aubameyang was in the right place at the right time again in the 66th minute as Arsenal conjured up another incisive raid.  This was Arsenal at their finest as Ozil and Lacazette combined to carve open the Leicester defence in a blur of flicks and tricks, presenting Aubameyang with a simple chance to tap in his eighth goal of the season.",SPORTS
"Cristiano Ronaldo Returns to Old Trafford, Insists He is an 'Example' Amid Rape Allegations ","Cristiano Ronaldo stated Monday he is an ""example"" in his behaviour on and off the field amid allegations of rape made against the five-time Ballon d'Or winner in the United States.  ""I know I am an example, 100 percent, in the pitch and outside the pitch,"" Ronaldo told a press conference ahead of his return to Manchester United, where he spent six years as a player, with Juventus in the Champions League.  A former American model Kathryn Mayorga, 34, has accused Ronaldo of raping her on June 13, 2009 just before he joined Real Madrid from United. Ronaldo strenuously denied the allegations in a statement just over two weeks ago and has been backed by his new club.  ""I am always smiling, I am a happy man, I’m blessed that I play in a fantastic club, I have a fantastic family, I have four kids, I am healthy,"" added Ronaldo.  ""I have everything. So the rest, it doesn’t interfere on me. I’m very, very well.""  In his first press conference since the allegations arose, Ronaldo seemed keen to stress his happiness in his new surroundings in Italy after joining Juve from Madrid for 112 million euros ($128 million) in July.  Off the field, the allegations saw Juventus' share price fall sharply and Ronaldo's personal sponsors Nike and EA Sports express their concern.  However, Ronaldo's form on the pitch hasn't been affected as the Portuguese has scored five goals in his last six Serie A appearances.  ""I’m not going to lie in this situation,"" he added. ""My lawyers they are confident and of course I am too.  ""The most important (thing) is I enjoy the football, I enjoy my life.  ""The rest, I have people who take care of my life. Of course, the truth is always coming in the first position. So, I’m good.""  - Made in Manchester -  Ronaldo made his name in Manchester with United, winning three Premier League titles and the first of his five Champions Leagues.  On his only previous return with Madrid in 2013, Ronaldo received a hero's welcome, but went on to score the winning goal as Real progressed 3-2 on aggregate in a contentious Champions League last 16 tie.  ""To return here to Manchester is a huge emotion. When I saw the draw, I remembered the history I made here,"" he added.  ""I won all the trophies here: Champions League, leagues, cups, I remembered the fans and I remembered one of the people who helped me most, Sir Alex Ferguson.""  Defeat to Madrid five years ago was Ferguson's final European game in charge and since his retirement, United have fallen on hard times.  After short-lived tenures for David Moyes and Louis Van Gaal, United manager Jose Mourinho is now battling to save his job with the Red Devils languishing in 10th in the Premier League.  By contrast, Juventus failed to win for the first time this season in all competitions in a 1-1 draw (Ronaldo scoring) with Genoa on Saturday, but United retain Ronaldo's respect.  ""We have to respect Man United. They are a fantastic team, they have an experienced coach but I expect and hope Juventus will win the game.""",SPORTS
"Bajrang Punia Settles for Silver, Otoguro Becomes Youngest World Champion From Japan ","Budapest: Bajrang Punia's bid to become only the second Indian to win a Gold medal at the World Championship fell flat as a tactically superior Takuto Otoguro of Japan stunned the Indian in the 65kg final, here on Monday.   Only the fourth Indian ever to make it to the World Championship gold medal match, 24-year-old Bajrang was rattled by the 19-year old Otoguro, who consistently attacked the left leg of Indian and emerged a comfortable 16-9 winner.  In the process, Otoguru became Japan's youngest World Champion at the age of 19.  Legendary Yuji Takada, who won gold at 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, had become youngest World Champion from Japan at the age of 20 in 1974.   A four-point throw gave Otoguro an early 5-0 lead, leaving Bajrang to play a catch-up game. With back-to-back take downs, the Indian reduced the deficit to 4-5.  The Japanese got more points with a step out and led 7-6 at the break.  An early take down at the start of second period handed Otoguro a 9-6 lead. The Japanese kept attacking Bajrang's left leg, a strategy which the Indian struggled to counter.   The Commonwealth Games and Asian Games gold medallist Bajrang eventually had to settle for a silver, which is his second medal at the Worlds. He had won a bronze in 2013 edition.  Sushil Kumar, country's greatest ever wrestler, is the lone Indian to win a gold medal at the Worlds, achieving the feat in 2010 in Moscow in the 66kg category.  Apart from Sushil, Amit Dahiya (2013) and Bishambar Singh (1967) are the other Indians to make it to the World Championship final in men's free style.  Udey Chand (bronze, 1961), Ramesh Kumar (bronze, 2009), Narsingh Yadav (2015) are the other men's free style wrestlers to win a medal at the World Championship.  Among female grapplers, only Babita Phogat (bronze, 2012), Geeta Phogat (2012), Alka Tomar (bronze, 2006) are the medal winners at Worlds.

Avengers 4: New Leaked BTS Pictures Show Pepper Potts in Iron Man Rescue Armour ,"Pepper Potts and Tony Stark were separated in Avengers: Infinity War when Iron Man went on to save the Earth and its mightiest heroes. Now, it seems fans will see them reuniting in the upcoming Avengers 4 movie.  Of late, a picture of Iron Man's fiancé, Pepper Potts is making rounds on the internet and is getting shared across fan pages. The picture has Gwyneth Paltrow (the actress who plays Pepper Potts) wearing a motion capture suit. The photo has led fans to assume that she will suit up in an Iron Man Rescue Armour.  Take a look at the picture:    If this picture turns out to be real, we will see Pepper joining the Avengers for the first time. Although, this will not be the first time we see her wearing a superhero suit. In Iron Man 3, when the Mandarin attacked Tony Stark’s Malibu mansion he summoned his armour to save Pepper. This when she donned a suit for a brief time.  After the picture surfaced, a number of fan theories erupted. While some fans assumed that Potts might rescue Iron Man from Titan, others argued that it is not possible because Tony is accompanied by Nebula on Titan with her seemingly intact spacecraft. So there are chances that Iron Man might return to earth with Nebula in her spaceship.  It is being assumed that Avengers 4 is set five years after the events of Infinity War. If that happens then Tony and Pepper might be married and will also have a kid, since the latter was pregnant when the war started.   Also as fans theories of Iron Man being stuck in the Quantum Realm surfaced, Pepper donning the armour could mean larger sacrifices.  Will Pepper join the Avengers and will she reunite with Tony, fans will find out in Avengers 4, the last film of the Avengers Universe.",ENTERTAINMENT

Asked why sexual harassment happens at workplace, she said, ""When someone is humiliating and harassing a woman, he must be knowing that the victim is needy and left with no option but to tolerate such harassment to save the job. It is about livelihood.""  The actress, who recently travelled to Busan International Film Festival for her film Yours Truly, said, ""Every company should have zero tolerance on sexual harassment so that victims feel secure while taking a stand.""",ENTERTAINMENT

Tanushree Dutta: Big Stars are Complicit and Uncomfortable Talking About #MeToo ,"The #MeToo movement in India started with the resurfacing of Tanushree Dutta’s ten year old case of sexual harassment. After she narrated her ordeal a number of women came forward to accuse multiple members of the film fraternity. In regard to the same, popular actors like Priyanka Chopra, Farhan Akhtar, Swara Bhaskar and Sonam K Ahuja among others, came forward to take a stand in support for the movement.  On Tuesday, at Aaj Tak Mumbai Manthan 2018, Tanushree said that many big stars have avoided talking about the ongoing #MeToo movement in India because they are complicit or uncomfortable.  While actors like Aamir Khan and Hrithik Roshan have taken a firm stand against the accused, names like Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor among others have been tight-lipped about the ongoing movement.  Talking about the support she received, she said, ""Some people have come forward on social media to provide support; some have taken a stand by not working with the perpetrators. But I am also aware of the encouragement I am receiving.”  She also expressed her disappointment over the treatment of her case in 2008. “They are considering it a controversy, not a revival. You wait for it to pass over - when you consider it a controversy. I was on national TV 10 years ago for three days - I had a lot to lose back then. I was moving to better and bigger projects back then. But I was put in a situation because I was subjected to it. I had to defend myself. I wanted to speak to protect myself from the damages. But the whole thing blew over,” she added.  In August, Tanushree Dutta accused Nana Patekar of alleged sexual harassment on the sets of 2008 film Horn OK Pleassss. She also made allegations against the film’s choreographer Ganesh Acharya, director Rakesh Sarang and producer Samee Siddique, of ganging up against her and witnessing everything mutely and not interfering.",ENTERTAINMENT

"Thugs of Hindostan Movie Tickets to Cost At Least 10% More Than Sanju, Race 3 ","It is usual for festival releases to hike their ticket price but Thugs of Hindostan, the Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan-starrer, which is slated to release this Diwali, is likely to burn a bigger hole in your pocket.  According to Bollywood Hungama, Yash Raj Films, which is producing the Vijay Krishna Acharya directorial, has issued a clear mandate to all the film exhibitors that Thugs of Hindostan’s tickets be priced at least 10% more than the cost of the tickets of Rajkumar Hirani’s Sanju (in multiplexes) and Remo D’Souza’s Race 3 (in single screen theatres), two of the highest grossing films of the year.

Kasautii Zindagii Kay: Of CGI Flown Dupattas and Bad TV in the Age of Netflix ,"I was nine when Kasautii Zindagii Kay premiered on national television. Despite being one among the countless Ekta Kapoor shows that had titles starting with K, it nevertheless stood out for me. In my juvenile head, its story of star-crossed lovers gave it the feel of a home-grown Shakespearean romance, different from everything else that aired on TV then. I remember watching it night after night until I could watch it no more.  Today, 17 years later, I have long moved on but Indian TV is stuck in time, more garish and painfully uninspiring than ever.   When Ekta Kapoor first announced Kasautii’s reboot earlier this year, the show’s loyalists (yes, they exist) rejoiced but a lot of us shuddered inwardly. In 2001, a show like Kasautii worked, not because of its great content, but essentially because Indian audiences did not have many options.  However, the world is starkly different today, so is the audience and their sensibilities. 10-minute long slo-mo character introductions and CGI flown ‘dupattas’ may have worked then but today they will be seen for what they are—utterly ridiculous—and will be called out too by the viewers who are largely a generation hard-pressed on time, that speaks its mind, is known for dwindling attention and cannot imagine a day-in without Netflix.    But Ekta Kapoor knows it already. Why do you think she launched her own streaming platform ALT Balaji otherwise? Trying to monetise the untapped potential in the Indian web space, she has been consistently populating it with original shows such as Bose and Home. If she can put out such content on the web, why discriminate against TV then?  It isn’t just Ekta though. Colors TV also has its own web-streaming platform called Voot, which features interesting originals such as Feet Up With The Stars and Stupid Man Smart Phone. Its television shows meanwhile are still lamentably limited to Naagin, which is now in its third season (the horror!) and Bigg Boss, now in its 12th season (says it all).  Interestingly, despite global web-streaming platforms wolfing a large share of the domestic entertainment space, TV still is the most popular source of entertainment in India for it reaches even areas where the internet hasn’t yet. It offers content in regional languages, a versatility which international media service providers are working towards.  But just because a clear divide is now emerging in who watches what, is it fair to feed off it? Make viewers in Jabalpur suffer through the ‘saas bahu aur saazish’ type content on TV while simultaneously aspiring to grab the attention of the metro junta with content-driven web shows?  So dear daily soap creators, here’s a request—use new shiny bottles all you want, but don’t serve rotten old wine. We may not all binge-watch Netflix or live in metro cities, but we can tell. Also, internet will eventually reach the remotest of India much like TV. What then? ​",ENTERTAINMENT
Ayushmann Khurrana: The New Middle Class Hero is Also a Box Office Champion ,"Ayushmann Khurrana’s latest film Badhaai Ho is registering phenomenal business at the box office. The film has collected Rs 51.35 crore in first five days of its release which is a noteworthy achievement considering the fact that it wasn’t the only big release of the week. Arjun Kapoor-Parineeti Chopra starrer Namaste England released on the same day, October 18.  With Badhaai Ho, Ayushmann has delivered his fourth hit in a row – Bareilly Ki Barfi, Shubh Mangal Savdhan and AndhaDhun are the other three.  In fact, AndhaDhun, which released on October 5, is still running in the cinema halls. In a way, it’s Ayushmann versus Ayushmann at the ticket window right now. He has done it for the second time. Earlier, Bareilly Ki Barfi and Shubh Mangal Savdhan released within a span of two weeks.  Overall, this is his sixth commercially successful film out of the ten he has done so far. It’s a fantastic track record provided he has only played the lead roles so far. Never forget, he was the lead in Bareilly Ki Barfi with Rajkummar Rao as his more-than-able deputy.  Ayushmann  Incidentally, the other actor he can be compared with in terms of non-film background and box office success is Rajkummar Rao. With Stree’s super success, he is on his way to become the next superstar for mid-pocket producers. He has done eight films since January, 2017. These films have seen him working with who’s who of Bollywood and still headlining the projects.  He was considered the prime reason behind the success of Bareilly Ki Barfi, Newton and Stree. He has his calendar blocked for many more months and with his growing brand value, he is not likely to look back for some time now.  Read: Badhaai Ho Movie Review Read: AnbdhaDhun Movie Review  Ayushmann’s rate of success is definitely higher than Rajkummar, but that’s also because the latter had to wait for some time to find his feet in the industry. While Ayushmann had a blockbuster opening, Vicky Donor, in Bollywood, Rajkummar worked in a series of films that focused more on art than commerce. Eventually, Kai Po Che and Shahid brought him to limelight. In between 2016-17, Rajkummar proved his versatility and the only thing missing from his repertoire, a solo hit, came with Newton. Stree consolidated his position. He is now an actor who big-budget producers can bank upon.  Ayushmann2  Both, Ayushmann and Rajkummar, are trying to be the quintessential hero middle class is looking for since Amol Palekar past his prime. The tug of war is nicely poised right now and the kind of impressive work these two actors are doing, the audience can only hope for better films.",ENTERTAINMENT

Joining them is Iulia Vantur who'll be making her debut with Radha Kyon Gori Main Kyon Kaala.  It is reported that Salman will make a special appearance in his rumoured girlfriend Iulia's film. DNA quoted a source as saying, ""Salman is not only close to Iulia, he is also very fond of director Prem Soni, who directed him in Mr & Mrs Khanna. When Prem fell ill a few years ago, Salman offered him his support, and now that he’s directing a film with Iulia in the lead, it’s only natural that Salman should pitch in.""  In the film, Iulia will be seen playing the role of a Lord Krishna disciple. Directed by Prem R Soni, Radha Kyon Gori Main Kyon Kaala is based on true incidents which deal with the rape of a foreigner who visits India to know and understand Indian culture.  On the other hand, Salman recently wrapped the Malta schedule of Bharat, which is an official adaptation of the South Korean film Ode To My Father that depicted modern Korean history from the 1950s to the present day through the life of an ordinary man and events such as the Hungnam Evacuation during the 1950 Korean War.",ENTERTAINMENT
Nicole Kidman Opens Up on Why She Rarely Speaks About Marriage to Tom Cruise at 23 ,"Actor Nicole Kidman recently made headlines when she spoke about how being married to Tom Cruise in her 20s protected her from being sexually abused in the industry.  On Monday, the Academy Award-winning actor appeared on the Today show, wherein she further explained what she had meant about being ""protected"".  ""I was married at 23 years old, I wasn't going to parties or I wasn't going out a lot. I was pretty much at home. I had my first child at 25 and I was a married — I was in a family. So my sense of being in the world was — I was working, or I was at home,"" she said.  She continued: “I think when you’re married to a very powerful man, I mean, I’m not in a male’s mind but... when I said ‘protection,’ I think there’s almost like a barrier a lot of women don’t have — that a lot of people in the world don’t have.”  In an interview with New York magazine for its Women and Power series, Kidman had talked about how her the then-husband Cruise's star status shielded her from all kinds of abuse in Hollywood.  “I got married very young, but it definitely wasn’t power for me — it was protection. I married for love, but being married to an extremely powerful man kept me from being sexually harassed. I would work, but I was still very much cocooned. So when I came out of it at 32, 33, it’s almost like I had to grow up,"" she had said.  Kidman and Cruise were married on December 24 in 1990 after meeting on the set of action film Days of Thunder in 1989.  The pair were married for over 10 years and adopted two children: Isabella Jane and Connor Antony. Cruise filed for divorce from her in 2001.  Kidman tied the knot with Urban in 2006. They have two daughters together: Sunday Rose, 10, and Faith Margaret, 7.  ",ENTERTAINMENT
